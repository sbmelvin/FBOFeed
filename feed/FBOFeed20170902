<DESC>Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E144, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.
<p>Description:<br />National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Genome Integrity, Flow Cytometry Core Facility, plans to procure on a sole source basis a 12-channel dual camera ImageStream ISX Mark II imaging flow cytometer that is manufactured by Amnis/EMD MilliporeSigma, Corp. 290 Concord Road Billerica, MA 01821 USA.</p>
<p>The response close date of this notice for this requirement is in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)(1). This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The equipment shall be delivered and installed, and training completed within 120 days of purchase order.<br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.<br /><br />The research program in the Laboratory of Genome Integrity is focused on the exploration of the causes and effects of genomic instability, mechanisms of DNA repair and the study of DNA repair breakdown as an initiating or protective event in aging and cancers. The program will emphasize a mechanistic understanding of the pathways that maintain genomic integrity, the intersection of these pathways with normal cellular physiology and cancer and the application of these insights to the development of new therapeutic strategies. The laboratory has made major contributions towards a detailed understanding of DNA repair pathway selection as a primary influence on genomic stability and drug resistance/sensitivity in breast and ovarian cancers and the influential role of DNA repair proteins in the promotion of specific hematological malignancies.</p>
<p>The Laboratory is also expanding its efforts in the areas of cellular identity and development by examining the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into early T-cell lineage progenitors. This new program will place particular importance towards a comprehensive understanding of the cellular signals that influence hematopoietic progenitor migration, the transcription factors that positively and negatively impact T-cell lineage selection and the contribution of deregulated normal developmental processes in T-cell aging and cancer. The Laboratory of Genome Integrity also manages a state-of-the-art flow cytometry core that houses four cell sorters, four cell analyzers and serves the scientific needs of over 200 scientists and 80 different principal investigators every year. This facility will continue to provide both routine as well as highly specialized sorting services to members of the CCR-NCI community.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the following salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics, inclusive of hardware and/or software specifications, that are deemed essential to the needs of the Government:</p>
<p>PRODUCT FEATURES/SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS<br />The following product features/characteristics are deemed essential for this requirement:</p>
<p>The instrument must be a benchtop imaging flow cytometer that meets the following specifications:<br />a. Be capable of acquiring cells in flow up to 5,000 events per second and provide high throughput rapid image analysis of up to millions of cells for structural, morphological and rare event analysis within a reasonable time frame.<br />b. Be capable of illuminating cells with a minimum of 4 lasers of high power (higher than traditional flow cytometers) of excitation wavelength of 488nm/200mW (blue), 642nm/150mW (red), 405nm/120mW (violet), and 561nm/200mW (green) to allow for the possible most versatile excitation of existing fluorochromes and fluorescent reagents.<br />c. Be capable of detecting fluorescence emitting cells with a minimum of 10 fluorescent channels with optical bands pass filters in the range of 450nm, 530nm, 580nm, 620nm, 660nm (off both red and green lasers simultaneously), 690-710nm (off both blue and green lasers simultaneously), and 760nm (off both red and green lasers simultaneously) to allow for the possible most versatile detection of existing fluorochromes and fluorescent reagents and allow the utilization of up to ten different fluorescent labeled markers on each cell.<br />d. Be capable of capturing dark field images using a long wavelength laser source to provide detailed structural information on cells.<br />e. Be capable of capturing bright field images to provide detailed structural information on cells and to allow rare event verification. <br />f. Utilize two separate charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras simultaneously to detect light and multiple fluorescent light signals. The cameras must be distinctly linked to separate laser lines. This is necessary to allow spectral separation of fluorescent signals of the same emission wavelength derived from different excitation lasers (see above "c").<br />g. Be capable of continuously monitoring the focal point of cells in flow and adjust camera focus accordingly. This is critical since cells in continuous flow in a core stream will move along the z-axis enough to frequently move out of focus and render image acquisition ineffective. Rapid camera focus adjustment may be achieved by using fluorescent tracking beads that are continuously monitored in the background during sample acquisition.<br />h. Utilize multiple optical magnifications. Expected magnifications include 20x, 40x and 60x (or above) range with sufficient numeric aperture lenses (0.5-0.9) that can provide detailed, high quality structural and morphological cell images. The system must be capable of detecting not only cells but subcellular organelles, structures and be capable of detecting spatial localization and co-localization of fluorescent signals with a resolution of up to 0.3um pixel size. Multiple magnification is necessary to allow targeted analysis of larger events (entire cells) vs. smaller events (subcellular organelles and intracytoplasmic or intranuclear aggregates and foci).<br />i. Be capable of using alternate focus modalities: high focusing accuracy to detect localization and co-localization of small, subcellular particles vs. broad depth of field imaging to allow whole cell imaging and acquisition of cumulative fluorescent signals from entire cells.<br />j. Availability of high performance, dedicated image software with specific ability to analyze potentially hundreds of morphological characteristics on thousands of cells combined with multiple fluorescent signals. Special algorithms must be applied to identify and exclude out-of-focus events from the analysis.<br />k. The analysis software must be intelligent and adaptive such that it can discover hidden patterns from a very large number of quantitative data. The software should also support traditional two-dimensional flow cytometry display not only with fluorescent signals but appropriately quantified morphological features to allow heuristic identification of unique, consistent features of the analyzed cells beyond traditional fluorescent intensity measurements.<br />l. The analysis software must be capable of direct visualization of every individual event from a recorded image gallery. This is critical as one major use of the instrument is rare event analysis where visual verification is critical for highly confident identification of cells of interest.</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E144, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.
<p>Description:<br />National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Biology Branch (RBB), plans to procure on a sole source basis a 3T MRI for dynamic metabolic imaging using dynamic nuclear polarization that is manufactured by Bruker Biospin Corp.; 15 Fortune Drive; Billerica, MA 01821 USA.</p>
<p>The response close date of this notice for this requirement is in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)(1). This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(2), and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The magnet, console, and all associated machinery and instrumentation shall be delivered and installed within seven (7) months of the purchase order award. <br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Radiation Biology Branch research activities are focused on pre-clinical basic science research aimed at identifying and incorporating novel approaches to cancer treatment, evaluation, and prevention. A variety of approaches are evaluated at the molecular, biochemical, cellular, and physiological levels including the impact of the tumor microenvironment and metabolic mutations to improve cancer treatment. Intentional or accidental exposure of humans to ionizing radiation or a course of definitive radiation therapy can lead to cancer induction or second malignancies. Research studies are directed to identify interventions to delay or prevent radiation-induced cancer after the exposure has occurred. Emphasis is placed on gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms of cell killing and protection and the activation/inhibition of complex signaling pathways mediated by oxidative stress, including ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).</p>
<p>A variety of cancer treatment modalities including ionizing radiation, cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic drugs, combinations of drugs and radiation, various enzymatic inhibitors, antioxidants, and a variety of agents that impose oxidative stress are used to reduce tumor growth, enhance the radiosensitivity of tumors, protect normal tissues against radiation damage, or decrease metastatic phenotypes. Additionally, chronic inflammation within the tumor microenvironment or within radiation-damaged normal tissues can result in generation of ROS and RNS and means of inhibiting inflammation by use of inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), COX-2 inhibitors, and nitroxide antioxidants are being investigated. Novel functional imaging approaches including non-invasive measurement of tissue oxygen concentration and metabolism as measured by C13-pyruvate are being implemented as a means of improving cancer diagnosis, guiding individualized therapies, and temporal assessment of treatment response. The development, testing, refinement, and application of low-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) functional imaging devices suitable for in vivo imaging of paramagnetic species has resulted in a prototype scanner for small animals that non-invasively measures tissue oxygen concentration. The ability to acquire multiple images over time is a unique feature of this novel imaging technology permitting monitoring physiological changes in the tumor in response to therapy. Pre-clinical metabolic imaging using hyperpolarized metabolic substrates is also being developed to access tumor response following various cancer treatment modalities as well as metabolically directed inhibitors.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the following salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics, inclusive of hardware and/or software specifications, that are deemed essential to the needs of the Government:</p>
<p>PRODUCT FEATURES/SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS<br />The following product features/characteristics are deemed essential for this requirement:</p>
<p>&bull; Closed helium recycling system<br />&bull; Three hour magnet hold time<br />&bull; 13C quadrature detection<br />&bull; Hot fix capable<br />&bull; Ultra-short and zero echo sequences for imaging tissues with short T2 times<br />&bull; To be compatible with control software of the existing 1 T MRI scanner operating on Paravision 5.0 platform<br />&bull; A bore size large enough for a rat or large mouse (at least 18 cm)<br />&bull; A field of view of at least 100 mm x 70 mm<br />&bull; Less than 0.1 ppm magnetic inhomogeneity over the field of view<br />&bull; To transmit and receive broadband RF channels for 1H/13C and 15N/1H experiments. <br />&bull; High power, second order shimming using phase mapping. The improved shimming from the use of high power second order gradients are essential in resolving 1H and 13C spectra. <br />&bull; Upgrade capability to a liquid nitrogen or liquid helium cryoprobe. The cryoprobe provides a substantial increase in signal to noise ratio. A cryoprobe is not provided for in the current procurement quote but should be available for a future upgrade.</p>
<p><br />DELIVERY / INSTALLATION<br />Delivery address:NIH / NCI / CCR<br />9000 Rockville Pike<br />Building 10, Room B3 B48<br />Bethesda, MD 20892</p>
<p>TRAINING<br />This acquisition includes a full battery of instrument calibration standards to be used during and following installation. Also included are eight (8) days tuition to Vendor training courses for no less than three (3) CCM facility staff.</p>
<p>CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT<br />Payment shall be made in arrears after delivery, installation, inspection and acceptance, and successful completion of the required training stated above. Payment authorization requires submission and approval of invoices to the NCI Technical Point of Contact and the NIH Office of Financial Management (OFM), in accordance with the payment provisions in the order.</p>

The proposed source is the only known source on the market that provides an instrument with all of the technical requirements stated in the Statement of Need required for the cancer metabolism research being conducted at the NCI. Although several 3T MRI scanners are installed in Building 10, the physics of the DNP process place severe restrictions on the placement of the MRI scanner for the technique. A 3T MRI optimized for 13C and 15N metabolic imaging is needed to meet this existing constraint. There is no comparable technology to the 3T scanner with a closed helium recycling system nor other viable sources available in order to advance the CCR's scientific mission.</p>
<p>The proposed equipment is essential to the Government's requirement, and market research indicates there are no other companies with a similar product to meet the Government's needs.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT. IT IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NOR DOES IT GUARANTEE A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Announcement is strictly voluntary. The Government will neither award a contract solely based on this notice, nor pay for any information submitted by respondents. This notice is a request by the Government to collect information from interested vendors for the purpose of market research. A Statement of Need is provided for informational purposes only. Failing to provide a response to this announcement will not prohibit/exclude an interested vendor from participating in a future solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government is looking for vendors who can provide the following requirement:<br />Customized video-telemetry tags that can be deployed on and recovered from free-ranging monk seals and can be recovered from Hawaiian monk seals and able to withstand wear and tear from the marine environment. This will include developing specific modifications to the systems to aid NOAA in successfully recovering the cameras after deployment.</p>
<p>Background: The NOAA Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program is mandated to understand monk seal biology and ecology to help with the development of management and conservation activities intended to help facilitate the recovery of the species. This work includes understanding the foraging ecology and behavior of monk seals at sea. This research requires technology that can be safely mounted and recovered from the seal and can withstand a harsh marine environment (salt water, pressure at depth, percussive damage, etc.) Video data helps with understanding diet and foraging behavior. Other data including location, 3-dimensional movement, and depth helps understand habitat use, energetic cost and other components vital to understanding the ecology of the species.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334290 with a size standard of 750 employees.</p>
<p>Interested Contractors are requested to provide the following information in response to this Sources Sought Announcement:</p>
<p>1) A statement that you believe your firm has the capability to meet all above stated requirements.</p>
<p>2) Your firm's DUNS number &amp; CAGE code;</p>

<p>4) A brief description of your firm's past experience (within past 3 years) providing similar product.</p>
<p>The information provided in response to this announcement is limited to five pages or less. All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. The Government will not return any data provided in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.</p>
<p>The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>Responses shall be provided to Contracting Officer, Karen Beck via email at Karen.Beck@noaa.gov no later than 10:00 AM (Hawaii Time) on Wednesday, September 6, 2017.</p>

<p>b. Personnel Qualifications</p>
<p>The contractor shall submit documentation supporting a government determination that personnel proposed to perform the work set forth in the statement of work have a minimum of five (5) years of professional experience in the collection, preparation and storage of human urine. If the contractor becomes the awardee, the proposed personnel will be set forth as key personnel in the resultant purchase order.</p>
<p>2. EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>Documented evidence supporting the contractor's background and experience in working with biofluids, complex protein materials and the collection of human urine material. This documentation should support a government finding that the contractor's experience is adequate to perform all of the requirements set forth in the statement of work.</p>
<p>3. PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The contractor shall submit past performance documentation which is defined as references (name, organization, contact information, contract number, awarded price, final contract price at completion, contract type, and period of performance) of recent (within the last three years) and relevant (performance of work substantially similar in scope and complexity to the requirements set forth in this statement of work) for federal, state, or local governments, not-for-profit or commercial customers.</p>
<p>4. FIRM-FIXED-PRICE QUOTATION</p>
<p>The contractor shall submit a firm-fixed-price quotation encompassing all requirements set forth in this solicitation and F.O.B. DESTINATION shipping.

The price quote shall be broken out by cost element (i.e., direct materials, direct labor hours and rates, indirect labor and material, other direct costs (ODC), G&amp;A, profit, etc., as applicable) in sufficient detail to facilitate the government's evaluation of fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>5. If the contractor objects to any of the terms and conditions contained in this solicitation, the contractor shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:" [Contractor shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)]. It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to identify in their quote any exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. If the contractor does not include such a statement, the submission of a quotation in response to this solicitation will be regarded as the contractor's acceptance of the Government's terms and conditions for inclusion into the resultant purchase order. Except as set forth above in this paragraph, the contractor's shall not otherwise supply additional or differing commercial or non-commercial terms and conditions with its quotation. The Government's terms and conditions shall prevail and quotations in violation of this paragraph may be deemed non-responsive and not considered further for award.</p>

<p>7. A completed version of all required solicitation provisions (see attached "Applicable Provisions and Clauses" - required submissions highlighted in blue). The clauses contained in that document will be incorporated into the resultant purchase order.</p>
<p>8. A size limitation of BOTH 10MB AND 75 pages applies to submitted quotes (excluding the applicable provisions and clauses attachment). Submissions in excess of either of these limitations may not be considered.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>Award will be made, if at all, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirements of the solicitation represents the best value to the Government considering the Government's evaluation of the following factors: (1) Technical Approach and Personnel Qualifications, (2) Experience, (3) Past Performance and (4) Price.</p>
<p>1. Technical Approach and Personnel Qualifications: The Government will evaluate the offeror's technical approach to determine the extent of its understanding of the requirements and the ability of the contractor to successfully meet the requirements set forth in the solicitation using its described technical approach. Specifically, the Government will review the contractor's proposed method and instrumentation to be used for collection and processing of the single donor urine specimens at each urine albumin level and the contractor's estimated time for collection. The Government will also review the contractor's submission of information regarding materials the contractor will use for collection, processing and storage of urine material and the clinical assays to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the contractor can meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (Reflected in Statement of Work Section III.B. "Specifications of Equipment and Materials"). The Government will also evaluate the contractor's IRB process documentation for sufficiency (Reflected in Statement of Work Section V. "Protection of Human Subjects"). The Government will evaluate documentation regarding the personnel proposed to perform the work to determine whether their qualifications meet the requirements stated in this solicitation.</p>
<p>2. Corporate Experience: Evaluation of corporate experience will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the contractor's technical background, experience, and qualifications demonstrate successful performance for the collection, processing and testing of acceptable standard reference material involving human urine.</p>
<p>3. Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. In assessing the offeror's past performance, NIST will evaluate the contractor's work quality and timeliness and the extent to which the offeror has performed work of a similar type, magnitude and complexity. The Government will assign a neutral rating to offerors with no relevant past performance. The Government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the contractor in its quotation.</p>
<p>4. Price: The proposed price will be evaluated but not scored. The price evaluation will determine whether the proposed prices are fair and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. Proposed prices shall be entirely compatible with the technical quotations. Price is not necessarily the most important factor, but it will not be ignored. The degree of importance of the proposed prices will increase with the degree of equality of the quotations in relations to the other factors on which selections is to be based.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may, if necessary, request revised quotation(s) prior to award.</p>

<DESC><p>MODIFICATION 01 - issued to extend the response date from September 6, 2017 to September 8, 2017<br /><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT. IT IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NOR DOES IT GUARANTEE A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Announcement is strictly voluntary. The Government will neither award a contract solely based on this notice, nor pay for any information submitted by respondents. This notice is a request by the Government to collect information from interested vendors for the purpose of market research. A Statement of Need is provided for informational purposes only. Failing to provide a response to this announcement will not prohibit/exclude an interested vendor from participating in a future solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government is looking for vendors who can provide the following requirement:<br />Customized video-telemetry tags that can be deployed on and recovered from free-ranging monk seals and can be recovered from Hawaiian monk seals and able to withstand wear and tear from the marine environment. This will include developing specific modifications to the systems to aid NOAA in successfully recovering the cameras after deployment.</p>
<p>Background: The NOAA Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program is mandated to understand monk seal biology and ecology to help with the development of management and conservation activities intended to help facilitate the recovery of the species. This work includes understanding the foraging ecology and behavior of monk seals at sea. This research requires technology that can be safely mounted and recovered from the seal and can withstand a harsh marine environment (salt water, pressure at depth, percussive damage, etc.) Video data helps with understanding diet and foraging behavior. Other data including location, 3-dimensional movement, and depth helps understand habitat use, energetic cost and other components vital to understanding the ecology of the species.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334290 with a size standard of 750 employees.</p>
<p>Interested Contractors are requested to provide the following information in response to this Sources Sought Announcement:</p>
<p>1) A statement that you believe your firm has the capability to meet all above stated requirements.</p>
<p>2) Your firm's DUNS number &amp; CAGE code;</p>
<p>3) Your firm's SBA certified small business concern status. Specifically identify if your firm is HUBZone-certified, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or in the SBA's 8(a) program, etc. If your firm is not small, please state that it is a large business.</p>
<p>4) A brief description of your firm's past experience (within past 3 years) providing similar product.</p>
<p>The information provided in response to this announcement is limited to five pages or less. All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. The Government will not return any data provided in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.</p>
<p>The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>Responses shall be provided to Contracting Officer, Karen Beck via email at Karen.Beck@noaa.gov no later than 10:00 AM (Hawaii Time) on Wednesday, September 6, 2017.</p>
