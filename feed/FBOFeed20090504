The purpose of this announcement is two fold, first to ascertain if there is a viable interest from industry in participating.  Second to ascertain if the privatization solicitation can be set aside for small business; 8(a) small business; HUB Zone small business; or service disabled veteran.  

North American Industry Classification Codes of 221122 (Electric Power Distribution), 221210 (Natural Gas Distribution), 221310 (Water Supply Systems) and 221321 (Sewer Treatment Facilities) apply.  Small business size standards are 221122 - output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours; 221210 ? 500 employees; 221310 - $6.5 Mil; 221320 - $6.5 Mil.  Parties interested in acquiring utility systems and providing utility distribution services at Edwards AFB should provide a statement of interest for each utility system for which there is interest.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and its supplements apply to this procurement.  

Edwards AFB is located primarily within Kern County, approximately 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles, CA. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades and future utility system replacements. The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under 10 USC 2688. The statute requires that privatization must reduce the Air Force?s life-cycle costs for operating and maintaining utility systems and services. All privatization projects will be supported by an economic analysis based on accepted life-cycle costing procedures that demonstrate the long-term economic benefit and reduced long-term costs. If the economic analysis determines that privatization is uneconomical, a contract will not be awarded, and proposal costs will not be paid. The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and any other incidental services for the complete ownership, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades and improvements to these utility systems.

Parties are advised the Federal Disputes Clause FAR 52.233-1, Alt 1, found at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/52_232.htm#P1078_201096 will apply when the entity is providing services where the rates are not set by law or regulation for those particular areas of service.  Acceptance of this clause is required to be considered responsive to any subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP).  Contractor selection will NOT be made on the basis of information submitted, rather responses will be used to assist in refining the acquisition strategy and subsequent decisions regarding future issuance of the RFP.  If viable responses are not received, the Government has the discretion to determine no market interest exists and no subsequent RFP will be issued  (on a utility-by-utility basis). 

 Specific responses to the following are needed in order for your firm to be considered ?viable? in providing an offer for services under the program.  

Provide:

<DESC><p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative fundamental research proposals in the area of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and arrays enabled by emerging and maturing nano/micro technologies. The contemplated program on Nanoelectromechanical /Microelectromechanical Science &amp; Technology Fundamentals (N/MEMS S&amp;T Fundamentals) is seeking research by means of highly interactive, multi-performer (university/nonprofit/industry/other) focus centers dedicated to advancing a number of core technologies considered essential to the continuing advancement of NEMS and MEMS technology and its transition into applications important to the Department of Defense (DoD). Proposed research to be conducted by university and industrial research partners, with possible additional participation by Government laboratories (to the extent such Government organizations can prove their eligibility), should be focused on cross-cutting fundamental issues having pervasive impact to the technical community and capable of enabling revolutionary advances in micro/nano technology science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. <br />DARPA intends to fund innovative research efforts for periods of up to three years in the form of scientific focus centers involving multiple and highly interactive university, nonprofit, industry, and Government laboratory teams. Awards will be made only to teams led by an academic institution or a non-profit organization. A significant level of cost-sharing by industry partners will be required. DARPA intends to fund these centers at funding ratios (DARPA : Industry) of 1:1 in each year of the program. In-kind cost sharing may be included in the proposed efforts, but only actual cash funding commitments will count toward required matching. In addition to required cost-sharing by industry organizations, cost-sharing contributions by academic institutions will be permitted and matched by DARPA at the same 1:1 ratio, but such university contributions will be limited to no more than 25% of the total cost-sharing amount for any funded center. University cost-sharing in the form of faculty salaries, however, is explicitly excluded.<br />All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this RA, should be directed to DARPA-RA-09-42@darpa.mil.</p>

<RESPDATE>051409
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Applied Cancer Screening Branch, Behavioral Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) intends to procure on a sole-source basis services with Society for Public Health Education (SOPHE); 10 G Street; Suite 605, Washington D.C. 20002 to produce a special supplemental journal issue entitled Behavioral Constructs and Culture for Cancer Screening. 

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

Period of performance:  May 15, 2009 through October 30, 2009.

The purpose of this project is to produce a publication for the scientific community on a topic of key interest to the Behavioral Research Program (BRP)/DCCPS/NCI and the NIH. Specifically, the special supplement will discuss the outcomes from NCI-funded research projects. For the past 6 years the BRP has been engaged in a variety of theory related projects intended to stimulate advances in health behavior theory and its application to cancer prevention and control.  The supplement will address critical issues in the application of health behavior theories across cultures in the domain of cancer screening and has application more broadly to cancer prevention and control. The supplement will include twelve articles related to behavioral constructs and the impact of culture on cancer.  The main goal of the publication will be to help the audience of cancer screening and other behavioral researchers learn about integrating issues of culture on health behavior theory. This special issue is critical, given the burgeoning interest at NIH in health disparities and culture and its role in health behavior theory and practice.

Through its publications the Society for Public Health Education (SOPHE) explores social and behavioral change as they affect health status and quality of life. It also examines the processes of planning, implementing, managing, and assessing health education and social-behavioral interventions. The journal provides empirical research, case studies, program evaluations, literature reviews, and discussions of theories of health behavior and health status, as well as strategies to improve social and behavioral health. SOPHE publications are essential resources for behavioral scientists, community organizers, government agencies, health care educators, health care facilities hospital administrators, HMO/managed care representatives, insurance company administrators, nurses, physicians, public health and community planners, social scientists, and social workers. SOPHE publishes journals that are disseminated to more than 2100 SOPHE members, more than 600 institutions and libraries, and also enjoy widespread exposure through consortia arrangements. SOPHE is the only entity authorized to use the manuscripts described above and is therefore uniquely qualified to perform this work. For the aforementioned reasons, SOPHE is uniquely qualified to perform this work.  This experience and expertise are not readily available within the research community.  For these reasons, SOPHE is the only known source to the NCI capable of completing the work outlined in this procurement.


This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 11:00 AM EST on May 14, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Ashley Virts, Contract Specialist at virtsa@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-90092-AV on all correspondence.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), for the National Institutes of Health, http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov, intend to award a single, fixed priced purchase order on a noncompetitive (sole source) basis to Bruker Biospin Corporation, 15 Fortune Drive, Billerica, MA 01821-3923, for the performance of routine maintenance, repair, and emergency repair to laboratory equipment and systems.  

The service contract is for a twelve-month period.  The service contract is being conducted under FAR Part 13, http://www.acqnet.gov/Far, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-31. The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $5 million. This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(9), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplier or service will satisfy requirements. 

The reference number for this announcement is NHLBI-PB(HL)-2009-141-DDC. The acquisition is being conducted as noncompetitive, with no set aside restrictions.

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Sociometrics Corporation, 170 State Street, Suite 260, Los Altos, CA) for the continued operation of the Teen Age Pregnancy Prevention Database.
For cost and efficiency purposes the NICHD intends to negotiate a five year contract with Sociometrics Corporation for the continued operation of the Teen Age Pregnancy Prevention Database.
Sociometrics was established in 1983 and has been managing the database under contract since that time. The proposed new contract will permit the continued operation and management of the database as a publicly-accessible repository for social science data on the incidence, prevalence, antecedents and consequences of teenage pregnancy and family planning. 
In 1994, the scope of Data Archive on Adolescent Pregnancy and Pregnancy Prevention (DAAPPP) was expanded to include studies that focus more broadly on adolescent sexual health issues, thereby including studies examining behavioral factors related to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in addition to pregnancy. 
Sociometrics Corporation shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and processes to continue operating the database. Sociometrics Corporation  acquires datasets from  investigators, prepares the investigators datasets in a common format, and makes the datasets available, for a modest fee, through their  website.  To evaluate and to select data sets, the following explicit criteria are used: scientific significance; policy and program importance; validity and reliability of data and ability to generalize and the feasibility of acquisition of the data set. 
In order to perform the continued work, a new prospective contractor would need to develop or have an operational database and software that functions as a conduit for researchers to access research data utilizing user-friendly tools that allow researchers and program staff to run target queries.  Additionally, a new prospective contractor must have demonstrated successful professional relationships with researchers as well as demonstrated successful marketing strategies and networks in order to publicize the availability of the data to researchers and government agencies in order to maximize this valuable resource.   
To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in acquiring datasets, making the datasets available to researchers and operating the database. 

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C 253 (c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, Sociometrics Corporation is the only source capable of continuing these services without substantial duplication of cost to the Government, as well as unacceptable delays and loss of consistency make competition unfeasible for the continuation of this project. Interested parties may submit their interest and corporate capability statements in response to the requirements as described above in writing. This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor is an RFP currently available. All interested parties may submit their statements to the point of contact below to the contracting office address no later than Monday, June 17, 2009 3 p.m. E.S.T. See numbered Note 22.

NO COLLECT CALLS OR FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED.  RESPONDENTS MAY SUBMIT THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS VIA E-MAIL IN ADDITION TO 3 HARD COPIES.

SAMPLE SOW:

Sampling Frames Project
Statement of Work
March 10, 2009

Background:
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Helping to lead the way toward important medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives, NIH scientists investigate ways to prevent disease as well as the causes, treatments, and even cures for common and rare diseases. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.  The NIH annually invests over $28 billion in medical research. More than 83% of the NIH's funding is awarded through almost 50,000 competitive grants to more than 325,000 researchers at over 3,000 universities, medical schools, and other research institutions in every state and around the world. About 10% of the NIH's budget supports projects conducted by nearly 6,000 scientists in its own laboratories, most of which are on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  
NIH leadership frequently requires feedback and insights from various constituencies about the effects and operation of various NIH policies and programs.  Scientific societies, professional organizations, and advocacy groups serve as useful resources when seeking the views of constituents.  Additionally, the NIH has asked for input from advisory groups, has issued Requests for Information (RFI), and in cases involving the development of regulations the NIH has issued Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).  These approaches, however, may tend to filter out minority opinions and observations, and miss obscure facts.  Additionally, the input may not target or adequately represent the constituencies most affected by contemplated policy.  Finally, the comments are always unstructured and frequently difficult to analyze.      

Requirement:

When quantifiable input is required from individuals with different affiliations, characteristics, or roles it is sometimes useful to use well established survey methods.  This has been done by the NIH in the past.  One example is the report Customer Satisfaction and Research Involvement among Applicants for NIH R01 and R29 Grants (Pion, G., 1999) that explored opinions about peer review within stratified samples of NIH grant applicants.  Similar surveys are currently being planned as part of the Peer Review Enhancement evaluation process.    

Despite the potential value of surveys, it is often difficult to identify the entire population of a particular constituency in a way that would permit the development of a representative sample.  In many cases, the NIH may have access to detailed information about certain segments of a population but may have almost no information about other segments of the constituency.  For example, the NIH has a continuously refreshed list of all Principal Investigators (PIs) who apply for extramural research grants, but would have a difficult time identifying all potential PIsthose individuals in academic and other settings who might be considered qualified to manage an NIH research grant.  Another example includes the population of postdoctoral scholars in this country.  The NSF has a continually updated and nearly complete census of individuals who earn PhD and comparable degrees from domestic institutions (Survey of Earned Doctorates, SED), but there is no similar data collection on PhDs who have degrees from foreign institutions.  Since nearly 65 percent of all biomedical postdocs in this country are here on temporary visas, the SED is an inadequate frame for the entire population of postdocs.  

In addition, there are other challenges associated with conducting surveys which include creating meaningful questionnaires, building suitable sampling approaches, analyzing data, developing reliable inferences about population as a whole, obtaining clearance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and obtaining reviews by Internal Review Boards (IRBs) to ensure that the subjects are suitably protected.   The creation and use of online surveys to rapidly collect information from populations of interest pose their own special challenges.   

Project Description:

Therefore, the NIH seeks guidance related to the feasibility of developing general procedures for conducting surveys and for identifying and assembling suitable sampling frames to collect structured and representative information from constituencies of interest.  This feasibility study will help the NIH move quickly to identify and use existing frames or to develop and refresh sampling frames as required, and it will help the NIH assemble the resources necessary to develop and field suitable surveys that employ methodologically sound survey and sampling designs, power analyses, questionnaire construction, follow-up procedures that yield high response rates, data analytical strategies, streamlined OMB clearance procedures, and guidance on factors that will necessitate IRB review.  

Statement of Work

The contractor will assess the feasibility of establishing resources necessary for collecting information from NIH constituencies to improve NIH decision-making.  An illustrative list of such constituencies and illustrative subgroups is provided in Table 1, below.   The contractor will identify similar and relevant constituencies, whose members may have opinions of interest to the NIH. After consulting with the NIH project officer to clearly define populations of interest to the NIH, the contractor will describe the process of developing a comprehensive sampling frame and representative samples for each constituency, identifying sources of information on the various subgroups where they exist.   In some cases data may come from several sources and the contractor will need to describe how the data from the various sources can be assembled to complete the population.  If assessment of databases will require access to the data (as opposed to information about the database), and that database requires permission for access, the contractor will work expeditiously with the project officer and other officials as necessary to apply for access.

An illustrative list of such sources is shown in Table 2, below.  The contractor will build upon the list and explore relevant sources of population information to describe constituencies and subgroups as needed.  The contractor will then work with the NIH to identify the key subgroups and core constituencies on that list that will become the focus of the work.  Three to five hypothetical policy questions would be chosen at that time to serve as case studies, demonstrating how diverse questions could be addressed using various data sources and survey methods.  

For each key subgroup and core constituency, the contractor will describe the characteristics of the available data, including the list of key variables included in extant data, and variables that are not available but may be of interest for NIHs purpose.  The contractor will describe the existing schedule for updates, allowable uses of the data based on existing confidentiality pledges, and potential access to the information.  When overlapping databases exist, the contractor will describe the level of duplication, and the desirability of combining them.   Costs associated with access to existing data will be described.  Options for contacting responsible individuals in order to conduct surveys will be discussed.  Survey strategies may vary with the population.  In cases where a suitable sampling frame for a subgroup or a constituency is not available, the contractor will describe the proportion of data needed that is already available versus the proportion that will need to be collected anew, and approaches for creating a suitable sampling frame with estimates of costs.  Attention will be paid to how well the sampling frame would represent the population of interest to NIH, and issues surrounding sample bias, sample design effects, sampling weights, and stratification variables,

In addition to information about the available information on sampling units (e.g., individuals, organizations) in the frame and how contact could be made with them, it will be important for the contractor to indicate the availability of other descriptive information.  Variables may be used to stratify for sample selection; they may be used to describe individuals in the population, or they may serve as potential covariates in any subsequent analysis.  The contractor will provide information about the quality of data on these variables when it exists. An illustrative list of potential variables is shown in Table 3.   

The contractor also will describe critical steps in the development of surveys in general, such as when IRB or OMB approval and other steps might be required.  The contractor will describe how requirements for IRB approval or OMB approval are related to the contents and structure of the survey.  The contractor will describe issues with using sampling frames for cross-sectional studies, panel studies and longitudinal studies and how diverse research needs can be met, while managing sampling error, survey error, nonresponse, undercoverage and overcoverage, individuals in overlapping groups, and those who may be lost to follow-up (like temporary visas, etc.)

The contractor will discuss in depth the relative values of various on-line and other survey methods for the purpose of rapidly collecting information on the involved constituencies.  The value of having a pre-prepared sampling frame should be described emphasizing the value to any decision-making process (in terms of time or cost and the reliability of the findings).   

Deliverables:

The report will describe each of the key NIH constituencies (after the list is approved by the NIH). For each constituency, the following will be included:
a.	The size of the population
b.	How best to construct a sampling frame for the population, including information on:
i.	The variables needed for the units to be included in the sampling frame
ii.	Existing data sources that are available
i.	Extent to which coverage error/bias exists
ii.	NIH access to available sources 
iii.	Individuals in the constituencies that are not covered by existing data sources
iv.	(If applicable) What primary data collection will be needed to obtain information on other key variables
iii.	Based on existing data, descriptions of the distribution for key variables on the current population (e.g. gender, race, ethnicity, DOB, etc.)
iv.	The quality of the data on key variables in available data sources  including the quality of contact information
v.	The quality and currency of the existing data
vi.	Potential sampling procedures that can be employed
c.	Estimate funds needed to support the development of comprehensive sampling frames for each constituency,
i.	Identify gaps
ii.	Estimate start-up time and costs to prepare comprehensive frames
iii.	Estimate maintenance costs and challenges of keeping system ready to meet emerging policy needs
i.	Hardware/software maintenance
ii.	Updates/modifications to keep the sampling frame up-to-date
d.	Describe the development of surveys in general for populations of interest to the NIH including on-line surveys  (it may be useful to provide examples using 3-5 mutually agreeable hypothetical policy questions as case studies to explore such details as:
i.	How to develop representative samples for each frame
ii.	Required response rates and methodology
iii.	Reliability of inferences about the full population 
iv.	Stratified sampling approaches
v.	Developing survey instruments
vi.	Identifying skilled survey professionals
vii.	Procedures for obtaining OMB clearance and IRB approvals when necessary
e.	Describe actual administration of surveys 
f.	Describe the analytical procedure and interpretation of data 
g.	Other logistical issues surrounding use of such data to assist with timely policy development

Interactive Web-based Tour and Interpretive Presentation of the Lincoln Memorial
Statement of WorkOverview: Produce an interactive web based tour and interpretive presentation of the Lincoln Memorial to be viewed by the general public. The product will be fully accessible with a personal computer and the short video presentations to be playable on MP3 players.The tour will start at the bottom of the Lincoln plaza at the Hawaii/Alaska plaque. The viewer will be able to move up the steps into the chamber and move to both the north and south ends of the chamber. The viewer will also be able to walk around the exterior of the memorial and into the exhibit area. Within some of the views, the user will see a park ranger. If the user clicks on the image of the park ranger, a pop-up window appears and shows an approximately 3 minute video of that ranger delivering an interpretive talk. This short movie will have background music and still images edited in to help illustrate the interpretive subject. The user will also be able to click hot spots for a closer still photo of several features of the memorial including the statue and the two murals.The interpretive videos will also be viewable on MP3 players as "pod casts." The interactive tour will not be viewable on MP3 players.Purpose:Enable visitors to the park to enjoy a more extensive experience by making our ranger talks more available to a much larger audience via our pod casts. Enable people who are not able to visit the park to experience the Lincoln Memorial.Allow greater access to our interpretive services for the hearing impaired.Highlight the value of National Park Service Interpretive Rangers.Audience:This product will be made available to the general public free of charge via the internet, hosted on National Park Service servers. We wish to reach as wide an audience as this media generally allows. Thus, the full interactive tour experience may only be supported by personal computers, but the short videos will be utilized as pod casts for a variety of MP3 players. For the hearing impaired, text of the video scripts will be able to be viewed as an option but appearance of script text will not be the default experience.  Full interactive tour and associated videos to be hosted on NPS servers in a format widely supported and useable by the general public (Flash, Quicktime, Microsoft media player, etc.- may be provided in more than one format with end user able to click the version best for their computer) with a home computer.Video shorts with sound to be in a format readily useable by end users with display capable MP3 players.Sound from video shorts to be in a format readily useable by MP3 players without video display.Videos will have the option of text appearing as with "closed captioning."
Product Components:Interactive spherical 360 degree tour with NPS arrowheads as clickable icons for moving from view to view (place to place) and zoom. 18 locations Ten videos presentations approximately 3 minutes long of a ranger talking, incorporating cuts to other images (historical photographs, close-ups of items, short movie clips, etc) and background music provided by contractor. Scripts, "talent," and historical photos will be provided by National Park Service. These must be of a quality and format able to be shown on a jumbotron. National Park service will have final approval on content.Full screen close-ups of Lincoln statue (6), second inaugural speech, Gettysburg address, emancipation mural, reunification mural, quote above Lincoln statue, plus several of museum quotes (exact number to be determined by how many quotes fit in a single shot.Movie currently shown in museum converted to digital for inclusion as a clickable video - not one of the 10Three hotspot designs - one will be the image of the ranger; one will be the NPS arrowhead; the third to be determined - possibly an eye or camera.Function Design:	Each of the spherical panoramas will move automatically with the movement of the cursor.NPS ranger will be standing in some scenes. Ranger image will act as hotspot, triggering a pop-up window such that if the viewer is not interested in the video, they will automatically be back in the tour at the point from which they left (having never actually left).NPS arrowhead hotspots will move the viewer to the next spherical panorama.The third type of hotspot (possibly an eye or camera) will bring up a detailed still photo, or small gallery of several stills as appropriate to subject.Viewer will be able to zoom in on still photos for a more detailed view. The zoom will be at least sufficient to allow the viewer the ability to read the text of stills which contain text (Gettysburg Address, Second Inaugural Address, Exhibit quotes and inscription above statue)The two speeches and the two murals may require stitching several photos. The zoom capability would then need to be able to navigate within the still image such that the viewer will be able to:
	Image gallery and videos separately accessible and downloadable to i-pod (MP3)Movies will have option of printed text appearing for the hearing impaired but will not appear as the default. Button to activate this option will not be located in the image; if possible, preferably it will be located on a tool bar.Proposed Schedule	Shoot 10 ranger talks                      4 days	Edit 10 ranger talks                        12 days	Shoot 18 spherical panoramas      4 days	Shoot approximately 12 stills          1 day	Construct web microsite/ virtual tour/ deliverables 5 days	Review/ Approval 		   5 days		Note: Some of these activities can run concurrently - Total Project Time: 17 - 21 daysGovernment Provides:Access to the Lincoln Memorial - possibly very early morning, but will not be able to exclude the general public.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION: NATIONWIDE.

SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE: SEE SUBCONTRACTING GOALS UNDER STAGE II HEREIN. 

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nations most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, historic preservation specialists, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, federal building stewardship regulations, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

The Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), renamed by Executive Order in 1999, is located in Washington DCs Presidential Park, immediately west of The White House. This National Historic Landmark (NHL) commands a unique position in both our national history and architectural heritage. Designed by Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Alfred B. Mullett, the EEOB was built between 1871-1888 to house the growing staff of the Departments of State, War, and Navy, and is considered among the best examples of French Second Empire architecture in the country. Restoration of interior building spaces began in 1983. Since then, main corridors, libraries, stairwell domes, stained glass rotundas, and certain offices have been restored. Originally known as the State, War, and Navy Building, the EEOB housed the three departments associated with formulating and conducting the nations foreign policy in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century  the period when the United States emerged as an international power. The building has housed many of the nations most significant diplomats, politicians and military leaders and has been the scene of many historic events. 

Due to its proximity to the White House, the EEOB houses a majority of the White House Staff offices.  The building houses the Office of Management and Budget, the National Security Council, White House Counsel, and numerous other offices critical to the Presidential Administration. The EEOB is currently undergoing a 3 phased multi-year modernization and security upgrade. As the modernizations programmatic requirements evolved, it became clear that a new ADA compliant security screening facility and entrance was needed for employees, guests, and dignitaries. However, the exact size, scope, and complexity of the overall project are still under discussion and exploration. The numbers and figures described in this pre-solicitation notice are based on government estimates and projections.  GSA realizes that these numbers are subject to change. Due to the constraints of this project, its complex environment, historic preservation requirements, and the potential impact on contributing historical resources, GSA will require the services of our nations most talented lead designer for performance of architectural bridging design document services.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural bridging design document services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.

The proposed facility will be required to meet or exceed Federal energy goals. In addition, due to the sensitive nature of the work performed by EOP OA and USSS UD, the design of the facility and site must meet stringent federal security requirements. The screening facility will comply with PBS P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service), U.S. Building Codes, and U.S. Government requirements, including the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Department of Interior, Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation, and associated design and landscape guidelines, as well as other applicable laws, codes, and standards.  The White House Security Guidelines and the United States Secret Services Technical Security Division have determined the classification level for this project. All judgments and proposed amendments to stated classification determinations must be presented to and approved by the United States Secret Service and White House Security.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

The project may provide approximately 800 GSF of new construction and adaptation of a National Historic Landmark. The intent of this project is to serve the needs of tenant agencies by providing a new ADA compliant building access and security screening facility. The new facility will function as a screening, credentialing, and holding area for employees, guests, and dignitaries wishing to gain entrance to the EEOB. A satisfactory outcome will meet tenant agency requirements with new construction that relates successfully to the surrounding urban landscape, architecture and historical context.  The scope of architectural bridging design documents services will include: architecture; civil; historical preservation; interior design; urban site and landscape design; and a requirement for Design Excellence peer reviews and concept approval submission and presentation to the PBS Commissioner. Due to the sensitive nature of the proposed facilitys location and function, this Design Excellence opportunity will ONLY ADDRESS THE ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPT of the facility. These Design Excellence architectural bridging design documents shall be categorized as Sensitive but Unclassified.  All mechanical, electrical, plumbing, communications, IT, security, fire protection, physical security, and all other sensitive components of the facility will be integrated into the bridging design documents by the subsequent design-build firm. A design firm, which holds proper facility clearances, will be utilized as an advisor for any coordination or implementation issues during the architectural bridging document development that involve classified systems or details. 

SCOPE OF WORK: 

The goals for this procurement are as follows: complete a client program evaluation defining the project and programmatic requirements and provide architectural bridging design document services.  A design-build contractor, under a separate solicitation, will use the architectural bridging documents as bases for a full design. This procurement is to address the architectural bridging design only and will not address classified systems, components, or processes. 

All conceptual/bridging design work will be required to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Department of Interior, Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation.  Design submissions will include: an illustrated preservation report identifying all relevant design details, potential conflicts with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards and solutions for preventing all adverse effects, as defined in the NHPA, while achieving project goals. The Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO) must evaluate each design concept for compliance with all applicable preservation standards. The RHPO may request and coordinate additional design reviews based on their interpretation of each design submission. The lead designer and A/E team will 1. Participate in design consultations and presentations for project approvals by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA); 2. Fully engage  tenants in the planning and design of the screening facility and its thoughtful integration into the EEOB, its historic landscape and urban context- the Presidential Park precinct; 3. Develop an architectural bridging design that maintains and enhances the existing cultural, natural, and physical attributes of the site; 4. Balance historic preservation with new construction, including the coexistence within the historic setting, and 5. Respect, incorporate, and interpret the significance of the Eisenhower Executive Office Buildings past, and that of Pennsylvania Avenue; 6. Subscribe to the Design Excellence goals; 7. Produce an architectural bridging design capable of achieving  a  level of sustainable design/green architecture for the facility that will meet or exceed the United States Green Building Councils (USGBC) Silver LEED rating; 8. Plan and design to promote reciprocal natural views and sightlines from Pennsylvania Avenue to the EEOB; 9. Engage a planning and design approach that explores opportunities which will accomplish preservation of adjacent historic setting and urban context and 10. Integrate basic operational and physical security elements within the Presidential Park precinct.

<DESC>DESC: The United States Government has a requirement to provide three dimensional (3D) Entry Control Point Moving Targets (ECPMT) on Convoy Live Fire (CLF) ranges at multiple locations within the continental United States.  The ECPMT shall be designed to realistically replicate a technical truck approaching a check point at a typical Forward Operating Base (FOB).<BR><BR>The ECPMT is comprised of a vehicle target, engine hit sensor, Stationary Infantry Target (SIT) to represent passengers, prime mover, Battle Effect Simulator (BES), and a controller.  The vehicle target shall replicate a technical truck vehicle silhouette.  The silhouette shall feature an engine compartment and the ECPMT shall have a separate engine compartment hit sensor device. The SIT targets shall be target lifter/movers that raise and lower two infantry silhouettes (on individual lifters) facing towards the front of the vehicle.  The prime mover moves the ECPMT along the course.  A sequence of registered hits to the SIT targets or the engine hit sensor shall activate an onboard Battle Effects Simulator (BES).  The stopping, starting and steering of the prime mover shall be accomplished via a handheld controller. The ECPMT described herein shall be comprised of the ECPMT, an initial set of targets, track/rail components if required by the prime mover, software, installation, training and manuals.<BR><BR>The ECPMT shall initially travel a straight path approaching the checkpoint and then follow a serpentine path around barriers as it nears the observation tower.

<DESC><p>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and constitutes neither a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.
<p>The Air Armament Center, 689th Armament Systems Squadron, Eglin AFB, Florida, in coordination with Naval Air Systems Command PMA-205, is conducting market research to determine potential sources for a follow-on contract to the P5 Combat Training System/Tactical Combat Training System (P5 CTS/TCTS) acquisition. P5 CTS/TCTS provides realistic Air Combat Training to the warfighter and employs instrumentation on high activity participant aircraft and ground subsystem components. The system contains an air-to-air data link for sharing participant GPS based time-space-position information, and is capable of both rangeless and ground-based live monitor operations. This Sources Sought and Request for Information encompasses the continued production of the baseline P5 CTS/TCTS, modification of P5 CTS/TCTS, to include the integration of an advanced data link into the baseline, and sustainment of the total system.</p>
<p>The continued production of the current baseline P5 CTS/TCTS may be required beyond the current contract authority of June 2010. The government has no RDT&amp;E funds to develop a new baseline solution, nor does the government own unlimited data rights to the existing system. The government may also require modifications to the baseline P5 CTS/TCTS for reliability improvements.</p>
<p>The most significant projected modification, called P5 Advanced Data Link (P5 ADL), will require the integration of a Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) encryption radio and an advanced networking waveform. The JTRS radio planned for this upgrade is the Small Form Fit-K (SFF-K) variant. This radio and the Range Instrumentation Waveform (RIW) are currently in development through two separate government contracts, and will be produced as an integrated data link called the Advanced Data Link (ADL). Interested parties will be expected to establish the necessary contractual relationship with the radio and waveform contractors to ensure the total system, with the integrated ADL, will meet performance requirements. Availability of the ADL is not expected prior to April 2011; however, Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the upgraded system by FY13 is critical to meeting the user's requirement. The government will provide the Weapon Simulations Interface Upgrade (WSIU) software for integration. Interested parties will be expected to assume the role of a lead system integrator and accept performance responsibility of the modified system. This effort also requires a seamless integration into the existing AF/Navy P5 CTS/TCTS infrastructure without loss of current capability and compatibility with legacy systems, and must interface with existing proprietary display systems which are fundamental to the mission.</p>
<p>For the above efforts, interested parties would be required to establish subcontracts, nondisclosure arrangements, and interfaces with other contractors and government agencies to: (1) perform tasks necessary to ensure the design of the P5 CTS/TCTS, its interfaces, and subcomponent integration meet the system performance requirements in accordance with the specifications; (2) enable free exchange of information, both proprietary and nonproprietary; and (3) resolve problems to prevent schedule delays.</p>
<p>The 689 ARSS is interested in meeting the following requirements for continued production of the baseline system, modification (to include P5 ADL upgrade), and sustainment of the total system for an estimated duration of ten years:</p>
<p>1) Continue to produce P5 CTS/TCTS beyond FY10 and retrofit or produce the ADL-modified system totaling approximately 2000 participant subsystems (PS; airborne, internal, rack-mounted, etc.) and approximately 300 ground subsystems (GS) and associated Remote Range Units (RRU), based on service life cost benefit analysis results. <br />2) Integrate the ADL into the currently fielded P5 CTS/TCTS baseline through the modification of the airborne and ground subsystems, as well as associated support equipment<br />3) Meet Initial Operational Capability in FY13<br />4) Integrate Weapon Simulations Interface Upgrade (government furnished software)<br />5) Implement Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS)<br />6) Satisfy existing P5 CTS/TCTS requirements <br />7) Conduct test and evaluation, to include a System Integration Lab capability<br />8) Provide performance based field and depot level support<br />9) Develop potential incremental upgrades to include internal and rack-mounted configurations, bulk-net waveform, Navy battle group integration, and/or Live, Virtual, Constructive training capabilities<br />10) Address the potential for unlimited data rights<br />11) Provide system warranty</p>
<p>Information available for potential government solicitation includes:</p>
<p>1) Waveform documentation<br />2) Radio documentation<br />3) Some non-proprietary P5 CTS/TCTS documentation and drawings, such as, P5 CTS/TCTS performance specification, tech orders, etc.<br />4) P5 CTS/TCTS executable code<br />5) Joint Display System (JDS) user information</p>
<p>Required proprietary information includes:</p>
<p>1) Individual Combat Aircrew Display System (ICADS)</p>
<p>Specifically, this announcement requests Statements of Capabilities outlining specific relevant experience and/or approach, as appropriate, in satisfying the above requirements, to include:</p>
<p>1) Demonstrated production of airborne subsystems (i.e. pods), integrated with ground subsystems and infrastructure<br />2) Capacity to produce 360 PS and associated GS, RRU, etc., within twelve months after receipt of order, for either baseline or modified systems<br />3) Identification of ADL integration risk areas in relation to technical readiness and maturity<br />4) Experience/Knowledge in:<br />a.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the Air Force (AF) 727 Aircraft Sustainment Group (ACSG), Tinker AFB, Oklahoma for planning purposes only.  This (RFI) does not constitute an invitation for bids, a request for proposal, a solicitation, or a request for quote.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with the preparation or submission of the information requested.  The primary intent of this (RFI) is to solicit industry feedback on the viability of the use of competitive procedures to satisfy this requirement.  The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center contemplates a sole-source follow-on with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)(FAR 6.302-1) Only One Responsible Source for acquisition, upgrade, modification and sustainment of the SCOPE Command program.  

SCOPE Command is the networked radio and control system of the High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS).  The SCOPE Command program is made up of 13 HF radio stations located around the globe and networked to two Network Control Station (NCS) operation centers located at Andrews AFB, MD, and Grand Forks AFB, ND.  HFGCS is the Department of Defense program of record for high power (greater than 1000 watts), high-frequency (1.8  29.9 megahertz) beyond-line-of-sight strategic Command and Control radio communications.  It is composed of commercial off-the-shelf/non-developmental item (COTS/NDI) equipment, an integrating communications control management software suite, COTS computer and network operating systems, and COTS security and support software.  Each radio station is composed of a transmitter site, receiver site and control site.  The control site coordinates the functional activities of each individual station. The redundant NCS facilities coordinate the asset management and control of all stations.  Coordination and control of the system is facilitated using the Rockwell-Collins Communications Control and Management System (CCMS) integration software.  SCOPE Command operator consoles, used to control and manage system assets, are located at eleven locations globally.  SCOPE Command is a standards-based open architecture system, utilizing MIL-STD-188-110B, MIL-STD-188-141B, Standardized Agreement (STANAG) 5066 and other NATO STANAGs.  SCOPE Command can operate in single sideband (SSB) and independent sideband (ISB) modes, is automatic link establishment (ALE) capable, and supports current and legacy HF modem waveforms, including MIL-STD-188B.  The system is also expected to implement a non-secure digital voice over the skywave channel capability under the existing contract with Rockwell-Collins.  System-wide broadcast capability includes single-, multi- and all-station modes.  Additionally, the system supports the HF Email capability utilizing the Rockwell-Collins HF Messenger application and integrating software.  Upgrade and sustainment support is provided by five contractor-provided System Integration Labs (SIL) capable of replicating the entire system and its capabilities.

The anticipated government procurement will proceed with the following assumptions:
1.	The Government is not planning a comprehensive system replacement of the existing equipment and software as part of this follow-on contract.  SCOPE Command acquisition strategy is based on the evolutionary acquisition approach using spiral development.
2.	OEM data will not be available and Associate Contractor Agreements may be required.
3.	The Government anticipates purchasing three additional radio stations to enhance global HF coverage.  Decentralization of system operations will require proliferation of remote radio operations consoles out to mission-owner locations globally.  
4.

<p>SCOPE<br />The mission of the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) is to borrow the money needed to operate the federal government, account for the resulting debt, and provide reimbursable support services to federal agencies. When obligations are acquired by the Secretary of the Treasury for the Federal Government or delivered by an executive agency, it is the responsibility of the Secretary to liquidate those items pursuant to 31 U.S.C. &sect; 324. Obligations are usually the result of debt or liability collection efforts. Once executive agencies acquire these obligations, they are forwarded to BPD, Office of Public Debt Accounting (OPDA), Division of Accounting Operations for processing and transaction. For example, many obligations are seized and forfeited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in collection efforts under 26 CFR Part 403. First, IRS will attempt to liquidate the obligations in an administrative sale. However, if an acceptable minimum bid is not received, the obligations are forwarded to OPDA for transaction. Once OPDA receives the obligations, a qualified broker-dealer may be asked to sell or liquidate the obligations. Upon receipt of the confirmation of sale, the broker-dealer will electronically deposit the proceeds using the Fedwire Deposit System. Proceeds from pending sales are to be held in a non-interest bearing account in the name of OPDA until the transaction is completed on the books of the broker-dealer. OPDA will notify the agency of the date and amount of the sale and insure that the proper financial reporting has taken place.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain the services of a broker-dealer to take control of, safe-keep, and liquidate stocks, bonds, and other securities for BPD/OPDA on behalf of other agencies and bureaus. The broker-dealer shall establish a non-interest-bearing customer account in the name of the OPDA. This customer account will facilitate the deposit and transfer of funds and securities, and provide safekeeping services for obligations received. Upon receipt of a security, the broker-dealer will liquidate the security, deduct any applicable SEC fees and/or commissions, and wire the proceeds according to the Instructions to sell sent from OPDA for each transaction.</p>
<p>The following requirements must be met so that obligations assumed by OPDA can be liquidated and the appropriate financial reporting occurs. The broker-dealer must warrant the fulfillment of each of the following conditions at all times during the period of the contract and must notify the government immediately if he/she may become or has become non-compliant.</p>
<p>a. Be in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations<br /><br />b. Be registered with each of the following:<br />(i) the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934<br />(ii) be a member of a self-regulatory organization<br />(iii) be registered with the applicable State Securities Commission(s)<br /><br />c. Be in good standing with its Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) (i.e., not the subject of any enforcement action for violations of federal or state securities laws or regulations)<br /><br />d. Certify that all securities professionals associated with the broker-dealer (including branch managers and salespersons) are properly registered with the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), applicable SRO, and applicable State Securities Commission(s)<br /><br />e. Be located within twenty (20) miles of the BPD in Parkersburg, West Virginia and arrange for a courier service to pick up securities within 24 hours so that physical obligations can be delivered expeditiously for safekeeping<br /><br />f. Have the regulatory authority under both federal and state securities laws to conduct transactions and safe keep a wide range of instruments, including but not limited to, government securities, equities, warrants, corporate bonds, municipal securities, and Rule 144a securities<br /><br />g. Maintain sufficient capital to be in compliance with applicable federal securities regulations pertaining to financial responsibility</p>
<p>h. Be member of the NYSE, Inc. Medallion Signature Program. The contractor's medallion guarantee limit should be sufficient to handle projects with values up to $100 million</p>
<p>i. Submit the following documentation upon request: <br />(i) most recent Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single (FOCUS) report<br />(ii) most recent audited annual report<br />(iii) copies of all commission schedules, mark-up policy, and schedule listing all other fees (i.e., account maintenance fees, safekeeping fees, transfer fees, and any other fees related to the transaction services)</p>

The Agency intends to issue one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to qualified small business vendors. The following general information pertains to all of the above-listed services: (1) Assignments are performed on a contract basis; (2) Most assignments require working in Washington, DC; however, some assignments may require working in Miami, FL or short duration travel to other domestic locations; (3) Contractor personnel may be required to undergo a background security investigation and successfully pass the security clearance process in order to receive a BPA; (4) Contractor personnel will work on an "as-required" basis, depending upon the OCR's needs; (5) Free-lance assignments are contracted for strictly on an "as needed" basis, consequently, the BBG/OCR makes no guarantees on the amount of work assignments that contractors can expect to receive; and (6) The Government is obligated to inspect all contractors' performed work to ensure that it fully satisfies the Government's requirements. The Government is further obligated to reject all work that fails to meet Government-specified requirements.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span>: The BBG will not reimburse costs associated with "Local Travel" to/from the Contractor's office to/from BBG Headquarters.

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center (DDC) is considering whether or not to set-aside an acquisition for small business and is seeking qualified small business sources that qualify under North American Classification System (NAICS) code 493110, size standard $23.5M. This sources sought notice does not constitute a request for a formal proposal or a presolicitation notice.

This contract will be a follow-on contract for distribution and warehousing operations in the territory of Guam currently being performed under DDC Contract SP3100-04-C-0012.  This work will include basic distribution functions. DDGM provides customer support and material management through compliance with the Distribution Standard System (DSS) automated warehouse management system requirements and by incorporating expanded distribution expertise to enable forward positioning of Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) wholesale assets in order to support the anticipated growth of mission requirements in Guam.   A rough order of magnitude for workload projection is 100,000 receipts, issues and trans-shipments per year or an operation approximately the size of the Defense Distribution Center, Barstow, California (DDBC). DDGM performs the full scope of physical distribution functions typically performed at a DLA managed distribution center. The functions include receipt, issue, inventory, and trans-shipment service of retail and wholesale replenishment receipts. The center provides direct-turn-over and off-island trans-shipments, storage and care of stock in storage (COSIS), issue of retail and wholesale material, packing, shipping and local delivery. The physical distribution operations are government owned and contractor operated (GOCO). Contract oversight and responsibility will be the responsibility of the DDGM Continuing Government Activity (CGA). The general scope of proposed contract actions are to include but are not limited to the following: (1) Provide receiving, storing, inventorying, issuing, packaging, trans-shipmenting and performing Special Projects; and (2) Provide all labor, material and supplies, Material Handling Equipment (MHE), and Garrison Mobile Equipment (GME) maintenance, to perform the distribution requirements. The performance period is for 1 year with a possibility of 4 one year options. Full performance is expected to begin on or about 23 July 2009. There will be a 3 month transition period, which will ensue just prior to full performance. This requirement is to be performed at the Defense Distribution Depot Guam (DDGM)located on the Naval Main Base, an 8,000-acre parcel which is part of the Navy Apra Harbor Complex. Naval Base is located 8 miles southwest of Hagatna, the capitol of Guam and 11 miles southwest of Won Pat International Airport.

This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.

Background
During the premarket review process, sponsors provide the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health(CDRH) with detailed information to support clearance or approval of their medical device for a specific indication for use.  The premarket submission includes bench top study results, animal studies as well as clinical data.  In the post-market area CDRH has MDR information as well as registry information to support post market decision making.  To supplement what CDRH has, additional information is needed. The Risk based post market decision making project requires volumes of information about a wide array of medical technologies which can be retrieved quickly and efficiently. CDRH will use the information as a supplement to the data it already has to evaluate the impact of a particular medical device on patient outcomes, healthcare utilization, and the quality of healthcare and risks of treatment.

Statement of Need

CDRH needs comprehensive health technology assessments of a wide range of new and emerging health technologies, existing technologies for which there is new or conflicting evidence of safety or efficacy, and existing technologies that are being used for new applications.  These assessments should be independent, unbiased and evidence-based.  They need to cover medical devices in all product areas (e.g. imaging equipment, surgical implants, medical devices, diagnostic tests, combination products and biologics). The information available should be kept current.

For each medical device and indication for use CDRH requires the following information: 

	purpose of the technology;
	medical background; 
	related drugs, treatment and devices;
	diagnosis to which the treatment applies;
	clinical evidence; 
	publication history; and 
	future potential products. 

Information included on each clinical trial should include the authors and publications, the study population, the study treatment and outcome measures, the study results and the limitations.

CDRH requires updated information including scientific reports, and policy announcements from government agencies such as the CDC, NIH, and CMS as well as information on new guidelines and recommendations from health organizations and medical associations.
The detailed information should include a wide range of devices and indications, for example:

	Acupuncture and Acupressure for the Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting
	Cochlear Implantation
	Deep Brain Stimulation for Treatment of Dystonia
	Drug-Eluting Stents for Treatment of Coronary Artery Disease
	Endometrial Cryoablation
	Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillators for Primary Prevention of Sudden Cardiac      
	Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery: Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, Vertical Banded
                     Gastroplasty and Adjustable Gastric Banding
	Low Level Light Therapy for Joint Pain
	Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Breast Cancer Screening in Women at High Risk
	Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Breast Cancer Screening in Women at High Risk

Anticipated Period of Performance:  The period of performance for this data will be for one (1) year with the option to purchase up to 4 additional years.

Capability Statement/Information Sought:  Sources interested in this requirement must a provide statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this synopsis can be met.  Responses should provide a description of the services which can be provided by its firm.  This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organizations qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate  responses to a solicitation.

Confidentiality. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).

<DESC>Solicitation: 
FDA-09-1056013

Agency/Office: Food and Drug Administration 

This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201 (e) to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice.  This RFI is part of a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract.  It is emphasized that this is a notice for planning and information purposes only and is not be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.  Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking to identify any sources with capabilities or prior experience that can perform the following: 

Project Title:  
A Strategic Approach to Assimilate and Analyze Phenotypic and Genotypic Data on Foodborne Pathogens:  Integration of a Multifunctional, Curated, Searchable, Strain-Tracking (PATRN) system for Surveillance and Outbreak Analyses within FDAs Food Protection Plan and Beyond our Borders Program.

Background:
To develop an enhanced standardized microbial characterization data repository and software system called the PATRN system which is an abbreviation for the Pathogen Annotated Tracking Resource Network system. The PATRN system captures and integrates a dynamic, up-to-date group of phenotypic and genotypic traits that define what enteric pathogens are.  It will also capture the global expertise of food scientists and will identify information gaps that need to be further studied, which could then be assigned as an intramurally or extramurally funded proposal.  This program will occur in two phases.  The first phase will be to develop the PATRN system and surveillance network for Cronobacter spp. and Listeria monocytogenes.  Phase two will then be to coordinately incorporate into the proposed PATRN system the leveraged standardized microbial characterization repository data and software system.  In both phases of work, FDA labs, other government labs, global partners including the Commissioners Beyond our Borders partners will be coordinately linked.  This will result in an expanded, transparent and rapid epidemiological tool which will help manage the research and surveillance efforts of CFSANs global response during a foodborne outbreak investigation. Lastly, the PATRN system approach will unify historical information, and cutting-edge knowledge with surveillance information, both domestic and global, and will tie research activities of a global expertise pool of partners together with CFSANs and FDAs current endeavors, all under a single computer managed and informational focal point.

RFI Submission Instructions:

FDA will not award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDAs use of such information.  Responses will be separated from, and have no bearing on subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal RFP.  Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice.  Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such.  Responses will be reviewed only by FDA personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.

Responses to the RFI should address the following:

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic, Charleston, SCintends to award, on a sole source basis, multiple procurement actions fordelivery of Tactical Data Network (TDN) Gateway equipment and components duringthe period 1 June 2009 through 31 May 2011. The total estimated value of theprocurements is $2,100,000.  A class justification for other than full and opencompetition has been prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR) 6.304(c).  The anticipated procurement actions will provide for thecontinued development/production of a major system or highly specializedequipment, including major components thereof, and it is likely that award toany other sources would result in substantial duplication of cost to theGovernment that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Thefunctional and allocated baselines for the Tactical Data Network (TDN) GatewayRefresh have been set and tested in two engineering design models.  Contractawards for the procurement of the components integrated into these designmodels were fully and openly competed or justified via sole sourcedocumentation.  Attachment A identifies the original equipment manufacturers(OEMs) and the components to which this synopsis applies.  Attachment A may befound at the SPAWAR e-commerce website at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/.The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the Attachment Asources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  While this synopsis serves as noticeof the Governments intent to acquire this equipment from the sources listed inAttachment A, it does not preclude the Government from acquiring equipmentthrough other procurement strategies which may better serve the Governmentsneeds.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals;however, interested parties may express their interest and capability torespond to the requirements.  In those situations where the Governmentdetermines that identical parts are available from more than one source, itwill compete these acquisitions among the identified sources.  A determinationby the Government not to compete these proposed procurements based uponresponses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.Any response to this notice is due ten calendar days from the date of thispublication.  The SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston point of contact is Mr. CalvinHoward, Code 2.2.3CH.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

<DESC><p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This requirement will be for a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract with one basic and one option period. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as request for proposal No. FA8900-09-R-0004. The United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) requires Aeromedical Flight Instruction services. Training will be for Aerospace Medicine Primary (AMP) students and include "ground school" and flight-related academic lectures in a group setting, and provide a dedicated flying training unit that will permit student control with an instructor in all phases of flight. The flying demonstration and proficiency curriculum will be specifically designed to expose flight surgeon students to the rigors of flying, mission planning, modern cockpit symbology, disorientation, instrument techniques, aerobatic and formation flight. <br />The government seeks a vendor to provide an "operational" aviation training unit. This unit is to be initially established within a 30 mile radius of Brooks City Base, Texas area. The contractor will furnish all aircraft, aircraft maintenance, labor, training facilities and physical and personnel security. The requirements are for validation, small-scale testing, large-scale testing, and partial implementation of the USAFSAM Aerospace Medicine Primary Course, Flight Surgeon Flight Practicum syllabus (attachment 2). It is estimated that 1320 hours of aircraft flight time, 2350 hours of certified flight instructor time, and 1060 hours of flight surgeon/pilot time will be required for the basic contract year and it is estimated that the total of flying hours for the Option period is 1350 to 2700 hrs. The number of aircraft, flight instructors, and flight surgeon/pilots required to meet this contractual obligation will increase with each successive element. It is estimated that validation (element 1) will require a maximum of two aircraft and two flight instructors. Small-scale testing (element 2) will require a maximum of three aircraft and three flight instructors. Large-scale testing (element 3) and partial implementation (element 4) will require one or two flight surgeon/pilots and enough aircraft and flight instructors to fly a minimum of 8 sorties per day. The basic year will consist of three student classes and the Option period will consist of three student classes (see PWS attachment 1 for details). There will be two CLINs for the basic consisting of a FFP CLIN 0001 for Program Cost (i.e. program manager, student flight gear, ground preparation/instruction, student briefings, CFI instruction in Aeromedical fundamentals, data and reports) and a FFP CLIN 0002 - 870 hrs for Flight Hour costs (consisting of Element 1 - 60 flight hours, Element 2 - 90 flight hours, Element 3 - 270 flight hours, and Element 4 - 450 hours). Option period will also have two CLINs consisting of a FFP CLIN 1001 for Program Cost (i.e. program manager, student flight gear, ground preparation/instruction, student briefings, CFI instruction in Aeromedical fundamentals, data and reports) and a FFP CLIN 1002 (for pricing purposes please use 2000 hrs) for Flight Hour costs. (Price for CLIN 1002 will be evaluated using an estimated quantity of 2000 hours.) Pricing info should be broken down by the cost for each of the four elements described in the PWS. The NAIC code for the flight training project will be 611512. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. This is a Request For Quote (RFQ) and the solicitation number is F2V3999082A901. This acquisition is 100% set aside for small businesses. The 6th Contracting Squadron, MacDill AFB, Florida, requires the following: Test Administrator with one base year and four (4) Option years.<br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT
<p>CLIN 1 TEST ADMINISTRATOR/PROCTOR FOR WEEKLY EXAMINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT. CONTRACTOR WILL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING: TEST ADMINISTRATOR, PROCTOR DANTES, PME, DISTANCE LEARNING, DLPT, DLAB, FAA, COLLEGE/UNIVERSITY.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: May 12, 2009 - May 11, 2010</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31 effective 20 April 2009, DFAR DCN 20090318 and AFFAR AFAC 2009-0115. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is 611710, Educational Support Services. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 9411. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded. All interested parties must bid on all items.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />This is a Small Business Set-Aside competitive selection in which competing offeror's past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis where Past Performance is aproximatley equal to Price when being evaluated. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to the term of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and past performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each.</p>
<p>B. Performance confidence assessments will be made using the complete questionnaires, submitted directly to the contracting officer on all offerors and data independently obtained from the government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performance efforts involving limited to test administrator, proctor DANTES, PME, distance learning, DLPT, DLAB, FAA, college/university that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in the solicitation. Performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none if the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3. See Table below for rating and description ----</p>
<p>TABLE 3- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />Unknown Confidence No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br /><br />D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. If the lowest price offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. <br />F. If no offeror is judged to have "Substantial Confidence" then all offers will be re-evaluated and the contract will be awarded to the most advantageous proposal package submitted for this combination Synopsis/Solicitation.</p>
<p>G. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the section entitled "Proposal Preparation Instructions". Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse performance is defined as performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.<br /><br />H. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offers. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. If discussions are held, the Offerors will be required to respond to evaluation notices within a short time frame (24 hours or less).</p>
<p>Past and Present Performance Questionnaires. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror's past and present performance questionnaire respondents and information obtained from other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to access performance. Offerors shall contact contract specialist to obtain the past performance questionnaire, after receiving e-mail or fax to no more than five (5) no less than three (3) of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years. These Past and Present Performance Questionnaires must be submitted and turned in by the close of the solicitation. Any received after the close will not be considered. Past Performance Questionnaires for sub-contractors are encouraged, but not mandatory. Relevant contracts include, but not limited to Test Administration/Proctoring. Relevancy is further defined as follows:</p>
<p><br />Very Relevant Present/past performance efforts involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Relevant Present/past performance efforts involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual efforts involved some of magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Evaluation of past performance information will take into account present/past performance regarding predecessor companies key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Furnish the following information for each contract referenced:</p>
<p>(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Product/Service<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified, up-to-date name, address, e-mail, Fax and telephone number of the Contracting Officer <br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent/ past performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present performance questionnaires from the relevant contract respondents.</p>

<p><br />1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) of the U. S.

Each of these units is 10 feet in height, containing 18 carrier units with 4" X 6" trays.<br />3.4 The contractor shall assume the responsibility for any damage done to the units during this process and for any damage done to the facilities during the move.<br />3.5 The contractor shall perform general preventive maintenance on each unit as it is reassembled at the new location. If it is determined that some worn or broken parts will need to be replaced, the contractor shall provide to NTIS a separate price quote at this time to cover the replacement parts.<br />3.6 The contractor's proposal shall include a work schedule indicating how the contractor will accomplish the work. The normal NTIS work schedule for contractor work is Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, excluding federal government holidays. The contractor shall indicate in the proposed work schedule any requests to work outside these hours or on weekends.</p>
<p>4 LOCATION INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Potential bidders are encouraged to perform a site inspection visit of the actual equipment location at 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. The new facility is located at 5301 Shawnee Road, Alexandria, VA 22312. The distance between the two locations is approximately 4.2 miles. Both locations have direct access to loading docks.

Summary

The Bureau for Global Health (GH) is the USAID/Washington operating unit charged with providing technical support to improve the health of people in the developing world by expanding health services, including family planning/reproductive health (FP/RH) and maternal/child health (MCH); strengthening health systems; and addressing HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), avian influenza (AI), and other public health threats (OPHT).  GHs primary role in the health program area is to strengthen field operations, promote research and technical innovation, provide leadership and training.

Within GH, the office of Strategic Planning, Budgeting and Operations (GH/SPBO), serves as the staff office for GHs Assistant Administrator; provides the Controller function and the regional, country and donor coordination; and has primary responsibility for the Bureaus strategic planning, budgeting, programming, and procurement functions.  The Office provides leadership, advice, and support for overall strategic direction, resource allocation, and procurement planning.  It also works across the Bureaus technical offices to promote program integration and coordination.  It further supports efforts to monitor and promote the effectiveness of programs and the achievement of GH objectives, and is integrally involved in performance monitoring as well as appropriate evaluations.  The Office provides critical advice and support for the Bureaus donor coordination activities and serves as a technical point of contact for bilateral and multilateral donors and foundations, universities, and the commercial sector.  
Major Duties and Responsibilities

The incumbent will assist and facilitate program design and strategic planning in the technical offices of the Bureau for Global Health, and assist the GH Front Office in revising and issuing related policies for the GH Bureau and the Agency.  Key responsibilities include:

	Advising the GH Front Office on actions under discussion at the Deputy Assistant Administrators Committee, the Agency Cabinet, and the various Interagency Policy Committees (IPCs) and Sub-IPCs in which the GH Bureau participates;
	Monitoring issues, both internal and external to USAID, that affect strategic planning in health, to provide seasoned advice to senior management in the GH Bureau and the Agency on needs for internal related policy change;  
	Leading the development and revision, as needed, of GH Bureau Operating Procedures related to program design and strategic planning to enhance the bureau's strategic planning and programming processes;
	Providing  seasoned advice on program design principles and Agency policies, including strategic plans, to program designers in the GH technical offices and in USAID overseas Missions;
	Reviewing concept papers for new awards and unsolicited proposals to ensure their consistency with established policies and program objectives, and making recommendations on whether to fund or revise the concepts;
	Monitoring GH programs for performance and leading the annual portfolio review of at least one health element;
	Representing the GH Bureau in certain Agency Policy Coordinating Committees;
	Integrating results of various studies and analyses into comprehensive technical briefings, reports, and technical papers; and  
	Preparing reports and/or written analyses regarding USAID policies and positions on difficult or complex international public health matters.

Position Location and Supervisory Controls

The incumbent for the Senior Program Development Advisor position is based in the Strategic Planning and Budgeting Division of the Strategic Planning, Budgeting and Operations Office in the Global Health Bureau (GH/SPBO/SPB), and reports to the Chief of that Division.  The incumbent works with the Office Director, and the Chief of the Strategic Planning and Budgeting Division, as well as a wide variety of other staff involved in program design, implementation or revision within Global Health and USAID offices.  The incumbent has no supervisory responsibilities.  

Contacts and Purpose of Contacts

The incumbent works on a daily basis with GH and Mission colleagues, as well as senior-level officers at USAID and the Department of State. The incumbent also has frequent contact with other USG agencies, other donors, and private sector institutions, both national and international. 

The purposes of contacts are to learn how health assistance policies are performing, to advise on health program and policy design, and to communicate and interpret current Agency and sector policies.  Contacts can consist of planned or unplanned briefings and telephone calls, including with senior officers in the field or unannounced visitors requiring assistance or guidance.  The incumbent maintains these contacts to facilitate the implementation and monitoring of programs, and to identify opportunities for synergy between USAID and other donor programs.   

Work Environment

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  The need for short-term domestic and international field trip assignments to consult with Mission and cooperating sponsor managers of health programs may, however, expose the incumbent to difficult working surroundings and security risks during the course of travel.

<DESC>Solicitation #  1054698

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking Full and Open Competition for vendors that can provide quotes/proposals.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant of firm fixed price purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-31. 

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The synopsis, NAICS code  334516, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order  in accordance with FAR Part 13.106, for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures.  The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to:  Waters Technologies Inc.  Not withstanding, any vendor that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required product(s).  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing Best Value and discussions are not necessary.

Project Title:  Service Agreement for Waters Mass Spectrometer 

Background:  The Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry Branch of the Division of Analytical Chemistry (ORS/DAC/SMSB) requires the procurement of a service contract to cover the maintenance and repair of three QTOF Premier Mass Spectrometers, two QTOF Micro Mass Spectrometers, two Quattro Premier Mass Spectrometers, one Quattro Micro Mass Spectrometer, one single quadrupole mass spectrometer, 2 NanoAcquity liquid chromatographs, and 3 Acquity liquid chromatographs within our division (serial numbers listed below).  These instruments are critical to the development of methods for food safety, food defense and dietary supplements programs.   Because they are state-of-the-art instrumentation, they are highly computer controlled and only the most basic repairs can be performed by the end user.  Since there are occasional problems that occur after the warranty period has expired, and because we require rapid turn around on these repairs, we request the purchase of a service contract to cover these instruments.  


Requirements: 

1.	Service and Preventive Maintenance Contract (Part # WAT023894)
a.	To cover service calls and repairs, with 2 day turnaround for:
i.	QTOF Premier  HAA-090

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a sole source RFP under solicitation number W58RGZ-09-Q-0218.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26 effective 12 June 2008 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Document Change Notice (DCN) current to 20080513. This procurement is being conducted pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 for other than full and open competition to Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp., 728 Garden Street, Carlstadt, NJ  07072. The associated North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334511 with an associated small business size standard of 500. New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products, and no grey market. Offerors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Only qualified offerors may submit quotes. This acquisition is firm-fixed-price.<BR>This requirement is to procure Four (4) TR 420 Transponder Test Sets. This requirement is for a flightline test set capable of testing IFF Mode 5 in addition to Mode 4 and the civil aviation modes.  REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION: 1.0 PURPOSE: The TR 420 (Multi-function including Mode 5) Ramp Test Set is the next generation of avionics support equipment.  It is a battery powered portable unit used to test the operation of Transponders and Interrogators including Mode S Transponders, EHS, ADS-B and IFF (Identification Friend or Foe).   The authority permitting other than full and open competition is U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 entitled Only One or a Limited Number of Responsible Sources and No Other Type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed acquisition requires the use of the authority cited based on the following:  a.) The TR 420 is manufactured and available only from the proposed contractor, Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp, Cage Code 92606.  They are the only source capable of providing the capabilities, as Tel-Instrument is the manufacturer of the TR 420.

<DESC>Synopsis: 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Questions & Answers

1.       When asking for the source code, is this referring to the front end only?

We require the ability to maintain the application and make modifications independent of the original software developer.  If the source of the application is an existing commercial application the USMS will agree to discuss the issue further.

2.       Period of performance is 6-12 weeks from contract award. Is this the amount of time required to build and implement the new system? In paragraph 2.7 it mentions application support and maintenance. Do these two statements together mean that we will implement in 6-12 weeks and then provide support afterwards? If so, how long do we provide support?

If possible, we would like to have full implementation in 12 weeks.  We are interested in an option for application maintenance thereafter.

3.       In item 6.0. Does the statement no additional licensing fee or mandatory recurring cost mean that the USMS will pay for a period of service and support(para 2.7) up front? 

Maintenance and support will be an annual option.

4.      The software referencing in the request, are those that USMS are using now with the alternate request/suggestion from the vendor.  

We are currently utilizing a VERY limited Access database. 

5.     Does the USMS already own SQL Server license(s)? If so, are these compatible with Windows Cluster Services (e.g. SQL Enterprise)? If not, is the cost of SQL Enterprise to be included in the quote?

We currently have a SQL server 2005 license with 5 CALs.  Any related software license expenses will be the responsibility of the USMS whether SQL or others.

6.      You specify that the application must run on USMS servers. Do you own these servers? If so, could you specify them? Are they currently running Windows Cluster Server?

We currently utilize a number of Dell 2950 servers.  The hardware for this effort can reutilize existing hardware or new hardware as agreed upon by the USMS and selected vendor.  Hardware costs related to this effort will be the responsibility of the USMS.  We are not utilizing Cluster server currently.  Cluster server can be utilized if necessary.

7.      In section 2.3 the SOW specifies Crystal Reports as a reporting tool. Would you accept SQL Server Reporting Services as a substitution? (SSRS is included with SQL Server Enterprise). 

Crystal Reports compatibility is a requirement.

8.      Does the USMS already own Crystal Reports licenses?  

Yes.  Any additional licenses will be the responsibility of the USMS

9.      Do you have a list of the reports or basic requirements for the reports that you want this quote to include?

Reports should be able to parse table information by date range, user input, Object type etc..  These will be simple reports and defined by the USMS once the table structure is compelted.

10.      Could we get example excel spreadsheets (with example data) or a list of attributes you want to track on each of the 5 major areas that are specified in the SOW?

a.      personnel assigned TOG/TSB tasks

This will be a list of user IDs

b.      equipment used for TOG/TSB tasks

This will be categories of different types of equipment.  There will probably be a couple of dozen.

c.      project codes used to fund TOG/TSB activities

Project codes are alphanumeric codes which designate where funding comes to and from.  Less than 20.

d.      current antenna site lease information.

We have an existing Access Databse which tracks site information.  We would like these fields incorporated into this application.

e.      accountable property assigned to TOG/TSB and its personnel.

Accountable property includes weapons, computers, radios etc  Each of these items needs to be captured in the database and signed out to users.  

11.      In section 3.1.6, the SOW states that Client Configuration shall adhere to USMS configuration standards - what are the "USMS configuration standards."

The USMS Information Technology Division ensures the USMS adheres to DOJ computer security policy.  This mostly relates to server security configurations.  In addition client security configurations are also set for by USMS ITD and DOJ.  The application must be able to function in this environment.  Technical information and collaboration will be provided to ensure the vendor has the required information to accomplish this.

12.     Do you want to both print and read barcoded items? If you want to read items that have a barcode attached, could you outline the purpose and basic application flow you had in mind?

Yes. Much of our inventory is dynamic in that it is temporarily assigned to an off site location.  We need to be able to scan items out of our property and back in upon receipt.

13.   You mention both barcode and RFID. Do you wish to produce and read both or are you looking for a proposal?  

We would prefer the ability to do both but are open to suggestions.

14.   If you intend on reading items that have a barcode attached, do you expect the scanner(s) be attached to client workstations directly (e.g. via USB?)

We would prefer a wireless barcode reading solution preferably network connected 

15.   When an item is scanned, would it be acceptable for the person doing the scan to login first to the application on the machine where the item is being scanned? 

Yes this would actually be required.  Security is a concern.  We want to be able to track entry and modification history.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:IMDE-ACM, Concessions, Intermountain Region, National Park Service, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, Colorado 80228
Description:The National Park Service will offer a site visit in regards to the Prospectus soliciting proposals for providing medical services within Yellowstone National Park on Wednesday, June 17, 2009.  The Prospectus was issued on April 21, 2009 with proposals due no later than 4:00 pm MST on Tuesday, August 18, 2009.
The site visit is not required to submit a proposal for the Prospectus, but attendance is encouraged.  The site visit will begin in the NPS Concessions Management Office (Building 36) at Mammoth Hot Springs at 8:30 am.  The National Park Service will offer tours of the medical clinics at Mammoth, Lake and Old Faithful.  This site visit will be limited to the business facilities only; residences will be occupied by seasonal staff and will not be available for tours.  The site visit will include visits to the Mammoth Clinic, a year round clinic, at Mammoth Hot Springs (the northern end of the park), the Lake Clinic located at Yellowstone Lake Area (the center of the park) and the Old Faithful Clinic located in the Old Faithful Area (the west side of the park).  
The site visit will travel from Mammoth to Lake to Old Faithful and will end at Old Faithful.  You will be responsible for providing your own transportation for the site visit. The site visit will include driving approximately 200 miles and participants should be prepared for potentially winter driving conditions.  Yellowstone has changing weather conditions, and it is not uncommon to have late spring storms that produce snow throughout the park.  Also please note that there is road construction between Madison and Norris on the west side of the Grand Loop Road. You should expect 30 minute delays while traveling over this segment of the park road.
Lodging and food service is available in the park and surrounding gateway communities.  If you are planning on staying overnight, it is suggested that you make reservations well in advance of your visit.  Lodging during this time of year is often full and not available on a walk-in or short notice basis. You will be responsible for your own lodging and food.
An information packet will be prepared for this visit, and copies will be made available to prospective bidders on site or after the site visit has occurred.  Interested parties must R.S.V.P. by June 12, 2009 for the site visit, to Judy Jennings, Chief, Concessions Management Program, Yellowstone National Park at 307-344-2271, or via email at judy_jennings@nps.gov  Any questions specific to the visit can be made to Judy Jennings at 307-344-2271 or via email at judy_jennings@nps.gov
This site visit will be a tour of facilities assigned to the concessioner to provide medical services in Yellowstone National Park.

<DESC>This Amendment modifies FedBizOpps announcement dated 01 May 2009 to include the following:  INITIAL WHITE PAPERS DESIRED BY 15 JUNE 2009.

The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR), Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, Science and Technology Office (AIR 4.4T) are soliciting proposal abstracts for technologies that will significantly increase the mission performance, operational capabilities, reduce the total ownership cost, and improve system readiness of Naval Air Vehicles. Solicitation Number:  N68335-09-R-0204 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Topics include development of new Prognostics, Diagnostics, and Health Monitoring systems for propulsion, power and drive systems; development of Navy propulsion component and subsystem technologies applicable to fleet engines and near term upgrades/derivative engines which reduce fuel consumption; development of Advanced Aircraft Power Systems, Fuel & Energy Conservation Technology, Alternative Fuel Test & Certification Methodology Improvements, and Aircraft Energy Conservation.  Detailed information is provided in the NAVAIR publication Guide to Naval Aircraft Propulsion and Power Technology Development Programs for Fiscal Year 2009. The aforementioned guide can be accessed via the internet at:  www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/; telephone requests will not be honored.  Requests for this publication can also be made by mail to: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547, Bldg 562-3, Code 2.5.2.3.1, Attn:  Judith Dastis, Contract Specialist, Lakehurst, NJ  08733.  This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D)(2)(i).  This announcement and any modifications to this announcement will be open through 30 April 2010 in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps).  White Papers (WP) and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. INITIAL WHITE PAPERS DESIRED BY 15 JUNE 2009.  WPs (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by panel of government experts using the following criteria: (1) understanding the problem, including the ability to plan and implement the program and formulate pertinent objectives; (2) soundness of technical approach, including ability to integrate the proposed technology, adequacy of analysis and degree of technology advancement; (3) allocation of resources, experience and management, including facilities, personnel and (4) past performance in similar efforts, specific areas to be evaluated are quality of product or services, timeliness of performance, and cost control; and (5) and the proposed cost and cost realism.  No further criteria will be used in the evaluation.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds.  Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated.   Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept.  Specific reporting requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award.   At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report.  Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals or White Papers (WP) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate.  BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - WPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM.  Cost estimates in WPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged.  Offerors of those WPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal.  One original and three copies of each WP, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted.  WPs and Proposals shall be submitted to: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547, Bldg 562-3, Code 2.5.2.3.1, Attn:  Judith Dastis, Contract Specialist, Lakehurst, NJ  08733.  There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other Solicitation issued with regard to this requirement.  The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part of, or none of the responses received and intends to incrementally fund any resultant contract(s), depending on available funding. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this BAA. Responses should be forwarded at no cost to the Government.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Educational institutions, Small Business concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business concerns, Women Owned Small Business Concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUBZone Small business, Women-Owned Small Business and Minority Institutions are especially encouraged to submit proposals for consideration under this BAA.

This system will meet requirements that are identified as a Quick Reaction Capability; therefore, In accordance with 6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency, an unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition, and Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government. This procurement augments an existing network of UGS and monitoring equipment using Iridium Satellite technology and Falcon View software package designed to export data to other sensor systems for cross-cueing purposes. 1 System includes 1 receiver/base station, antenna, cabling and 48 low-cost sensors. Product  ion Objectives: 30 days after contract award 5 production ready systems shall be delivered for production verification and characterization testing; 60 days after contract award 10 production ready systems shall be delivered; 90 days after contract award 20 production ready systems shall be delivered; 120 days after contract award 20 production ready systems shall be delivered; 150 days after contract award 20 production ready systems shall be delivered; 180 days after contract award 20 production ready systems shall be delivered; 210 days after contract award 20 production ready systems shall be delivered; 240 days after contract award 20 production ready systems shall be delivered; 365 days after contract award 125 Iridium Satellite Kits shall be delivered.

The UGS utilizes seismic technology to detect footsteps and vehicles and transmit data at unprecedented distances.<BR><BR>Firms must be able to verify meeting the above requirements by providing certified test data or independent test data. If the contractor does not have that testing data available for response to this RFI because the Government will not release that test data, then the contractor will provide the Government Testing Lead Point of Contact information.  This procurement will be restricted to U.S companies and will be export controlled. Inquiries/information received after the established deadline will not be considered for this acquisition. Any firm who believes it is capable of meeting PM RUS requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be reviewed.<BR><BR>The point of contact for this requirement is Lisa Starbuck, Lisa.Starbuck@us.army.mil with a copy sent to Glenn Van Syckle, at leon.glenn.vansyckle@us.army.mil<BR><BR>All documentation received from offerors will be kept confidential and will not be disclosed to anyone outside of official Government channels.<BR><BR>Interested parties shall supply the information below in electronic format to: Lisa Starbuck@us.army.mil<BR>Company Name: _________________________________<BR>Contact Name: ___________________________________<BR>Position: ________________________________________<BR>Telephone: ______________________________________<BR>E-mail: _________________________________________<BR>Company URL: __________________________________<BR><BR>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Action Code: Presolicitation Notice<BR>Classification Code: A<BR>Subject: AERDC Broad Agency Announcement Additional Energy-Related Topics Solicitation Number: W912HZ-09-BAA03<BR>Set Aside Code: UP (unrestricted)<BR>Response Date: 02282010<BR>Place of Performance: To Be Determined<BR>Description: <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for various research and development topic areas. This notice is to identify additional areas of interest to the Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL), Facilities Division, under Topics CERL 4 and CERL 7. As a result the following topics are added:<BR><BR>D.1. Energy Security Assessments and Islanding Methodologies (CERL 4 -1)<BR><BR>1. OBJECTIVE: <BR><BR>Installation energy security consists of the capacity to avoid adverse impact of critical missions caused either by natural, accidental, or intentional events adversely affecting Army installation energy and utility supply and their respective distribution systems.  Energy and utility supply and their distribution systems include electricity, natural gas, steam, liquid fuel, water, and others.  While all Army installations are required to maintain individual energy security plans (e.g. Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 86-2), little guidance is available as to how the installations should perform their own energy security assessments.  Further, recent Defense Science Board (DSB) findings point to installation missions being vulnerable to the fragility of the commercial electric grid, leading to a recommendation to develop the capability to island critical missions from the commercial electric grid for up to six months in duration. <BR><BR>2. DESCRIPTION:  <BR><BR>a. Focus. This topic focuses on advanced research and development for energy security at Army installations.  Proposals are sought for the development and execution of the following:: <BR>(1) develop installation energy security self-audit methodologies and models, including energy security metrics for critical missions. Proposals are encouraged to include methodologies, standards and procedures, such as <BR>		(A) energy security survey methodologies,<BR> 		(B) standards for utility systems and energy supply reliability, <BR> 		(C) facilities prioritization methodologies,<BR>(D) coordination with resident anti terrorism / force protection (AT/FP) offices and procedures, and <BR>(E) economic impact methodologies for various energy interruption scenarios.  <BR>(2) validate the energy security self-audit models at up to sixteen (16) force projection installations based on the methodologies and models developed in (1) above, <BR>(3) demonstrate the capability of the methodologies and models of (1) above at up to sixteen (16) force projection installations in (2) above to project lists of actionable items to consider for implementation toward improving energy security, and <BR>(4) develop methodologies and  strategies to island the critical missions from the commercial electric grid for a six (6) month period.  <BR><BR>b. Special Considerations.  Special attention shall be paid to the following:<BR><BR>Level of understanding of energy security methodologies and assessment techniques required for a campus of various buildings, interconnected utility systems, and diverse missions.<BR><BR><BR>(Contact: Frank Holcomb, 217-373-5864, Email: franklin.h.holcomb@usace.army.mil)<BR><BR><BR>D.2. Ultra Low Energy Community Systems (CERL 4-2)<BR><BR><BR>1. OBJECTIVE: <BR><BR>Energy efficiency and energy security are of growing importance for the Army and the nation.  To reduce the economic burden for obtaining these goals, alternatives are sought to existing practices and technologies used in retrofitting projects by utilizing all waste streams and low energy approaches in combination with using renewable energies.  Greater cost effectiveness for energy retrofitting projects may be achieved by transitioning from the individual building approach to developing and implementing installation-wide energy master plans for ultra low energy communities. <BR><BR>Proposals are sought to develop concepts, methodologies, integrated technologies, and validations by modeling one or more Army installations within the context of Master Planning an orderly approach to changing the typical Army installation to an ultra low energy consuming community that achieves:  (1) Reduced energy wastes and greater use of energy conserving (ultra-low energy) technologies, (2) Maximized use of renewable energy technologies, and (3) Optimized Life-Cycle Cost.<BR><BR>Awardees should anticipate validating their most promising concepts at candidate installations such as Ft Irwin and Ft Carson.  Validation outcomes should focus on the ability to readily implement results at Army ultra low energy installations. <BR><BR><BR>2. DESCRIPTION:  <BR><BR>a. Focus. This topic focuses on advanced research and development for: (1) Energy models  providing an optimal selection of cost effective low energy technologies for a specific site with its unique weather, building/energy systems, energy costs, and occupancy demands; (2) Master Planning an orderly approach to changing a typical Army installation to an ultra low energy consuming community which includes consideration of interruptions and meeting the energy demands of Army operations during the  implementation of ultra-low energy technologies,  The orderly approach should also account for the use of land and space of a given installations long range master plan for growth and mission.<BR><BR>b. Special Considerations.  Special attention shall be paid to the following:<BR>i. Effectiveness of the models for selecting ultra-low energy technologies.<BR>ii. Design and construction requirements to install ultra-low energy technologies. <BR>iii. Optimized cost of selected ultra-low energy technologies. <BR><BR>(Contact: Alexander Zhivov, 217-373-4519, Email: Alexander.M.Zhivov@usace.army.mil)<BR><BR><BR>G.1. Microgrid Field-Scale Demonstration (CERL Topic 7-1)<BR><BR>1. OBJECTIVE: <BR><BR>Evolutionary changes in the regulatory and operational climate of traditional electric utilities and the emergence of smaller generating systems (greater than 5MW) have opened new opportunities for on-site power generation by electric power consumers.  Distributed energy resources (DER) have emerged as a promising option to meet growing customer needs for electric power, with an emphasis on flexibility, reliability, power quality and improved efficiencies.  The portfolio of DER includes advanced generators, micro-turbines, fuel cells, energy storage, renewable energy technologies, and smart loads.<BR><BR>The microgrid represents an entirely new approach to integrating DER.  Traditional approaches for integrating DER focus on the impacts on grid performance of one, two, or a relatively small number of sources and depends on the grid to provide voltage and frequency support.  Emergency back-up generation is an example of islanded generation using traditional approaches.  This is effective if the generator is never connected electrically to the grid or to other back-up generators.  Currently the use of multi-generators in an island operation requires a fast coordination controller to insure acceptable operation.  This greatly reduces the ability to add generation as needed, and loss of the controller results in loss of the generation.  The daunting challenge of building a microgrid with a large number of DER units requires a system of systems approach with extraordinary flexibility. Controls need to be fast and smart.  For major events such as loss of utility power or loss of a DER unit, the control response must be in milliseconds.  This level of response is achieved by each component of the microgrid using autonomous controls, based only on local information.  The longer time frame needs of the microgrid are provided by a distributed system controller, which optimizes the operation of each component of the microgrid, depending on mission.<BR><BR>Proposals are sought to develop, validate and demonstrate the microgrid concept, methodology, and technology integration, through modeling and simulation.  Validation of system performance of the resulting microgrid design may be performed via a field-scale demonstration at a subset of buildings that are part of the Field Artillery Training Center at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  The demonstration will determine the microgrids ability to quantifiably and optimally combine distributed energy technologies with other Distributed Generation (DG) sources in a seamless manner, for meeting the power and energy needs of all mission critical loads.<BR><BR>2. DESCRIPTION:<BR><BR>a. Focus. This topic focuses on advanced network science research and development resulting in: (1) developing decision architecture and system control models that integrate all DERs and loads on the microgrid, for both grid-connected and islanded operation, while maintaining grid stability in both modes; and (2) validating  the microgrid design improves energy system reliability and security, for meeting critical mission power and energy requirements in a long term sustainable environment.  Successful completion of this demonstration at Fort Sill is a major step toward enabling the Army to implement microgrid power architecture for deployed bases, as well.<BR><BR>b. Special Considerations.  Special attention shall be paid to the following:<BR>i.	Designing a control system to effectively manage and control energy and storage resources, to safely provide energy in a grid-connect mode that reduces grid energy demands, and to reduce operating costs during peak demand periods.<BR>ii.	Developing a control system architecture to effectively manage available energy and storage resources, to safely provide secure and highly reliable energy, and, to demonstrate environmental performance in an islanded mode for a period of 30 days.<BR>iii.	Evaluating the capability of the microgrid to be certifiable for purposes of environmental sustainability, energy safety, security, reliability, and cost elements for all operating modes.<BR><BR><BR>(Contact: Roch Ducey, 217-373-6760, Email: roch.ducey@us.army.mil)<BR><BR><BR>The BAA is available at http://www.mvk.usace.army.mil/contract/docs/BAA.pdf and is open until superseded.
