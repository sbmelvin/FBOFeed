<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR SOLICITATION W914NS-04-R-9003

1.	 Training for SCBA usage is not covered under SOL. I recommend that it be added to the Jordan training course. Could be accomplished in 2 days. The training to be provided is train the trainer type training.  The training to be provided is user level for both the SCBA and Breathing air compressor 

2.	Air Testing. Air quality testing is a NFPA and OSHA requirement and is required every 90 days. We can sort this out for you separately if required. Is a good idea even if not required by law as it helps maintain safe breathing standards.  Information beyond solicitation requirements may be submitted but is not required. 


3.	We work with a number of mfg of both SCBAs and Compressors and I wanted to confirm that you would allow for multiple proposals. This will allow you to get whatever product you want with the best service in the industry.  Multiple Proposals will be acceptable.

4.	RFQ does not specifically indicate that the compressors need to be installed. I see that you request turn key. Does that mean that you will provide the electrical connection if electric? Can you please clarify?  The unit shall be a fixed in place, diesel powered, the installation training will be included with the training program or the manufacturer and can install. 


5.	RFQ indicates that there is a SOW with Place of Performance. Please send this SOW. I do assume that these units will be delivered and utilized all over IRAQ. Please clarify.  The Delivery point for the equipment is Baghdad Civil Defense Warehouse (grid zone coordinates MB349858).  The Training location is still being determined and will be announced in the contract award. We can provide a place to have the training in the Green Zone.

6.	 You have indicated that delivery must take place by August 15, 2004. Is that a set date? I ask because the contracting and evaluation process normally takes a bit of time and there is the lead time with the manufacturers as well as shipping (Air Freight Being much more expensive) transportation with IRAQ (question 3) and if there is to installations (question 2) and customs hold ups to take into consideration.  The date of 15 August is just a ruff estimate as to when we would like to have the equipment in place and the offeror with the closest delivery schedule to meet that time frame will be looked at closer than others.


7.	Can equipment be shipped through the US Military system and delivered to a depot on the East Coast.  No, the shipment will need to be coordinated through your company. The two major shipping companies are FedEx or DHL.

8.	As there are no commercial flights in Baghdad and our techs all hold CAC cards; is it possible that they fly in with AMC flights until commercial flights resume? CAC card holders that are under contract are authorized military airlift.


9.	The compressor does not stipulate an enclosed SCBA fill Station. Is this a requirement?  Yes and this is identified in line item 0001. An enclosed fill station is another requirement of NFPA.

10.	Under the SCBA you have indicated 1824 complete units plus spares. Is that 1824 units with a cylinder plus 1824 spare cylinders? Yes, this is required in Line Item 0002


11.	Under the SCBA you have indicated NFPA compliance. Which NFPA do you wish to comply with as the newest requirement includes HUD (Heads-Up Display) and RIT (HP Quick Refill System) which are both very high tech, expensive and not ideally suited for firefighters that are not of extremely “high tech”. Please clarify. All equipment must meet related NFPA standards, most current edition of each standard. HUD and Quick fill are not high tech. They are both a requirement of the NFPA requirement. 

12.	Regarding Line Item 0004 for maintenance. Nearly all compressors require oil and filter change at 6 months, but this could be performed by anyone who has had the compressor training. Do you want us to include this in the proposal? Most other scheduled maintenance could be performed in one service round. This would also depend on exactly where the equipment would be distributed around IRAQ (question 3). Also are we to quote this to be all inclusive or would you like to have it time and material to be charged only when required for emergency call outs? The maintenance contract is only for technician level requirements.  User level maintenance will be taught during training and included in service manuals


13.	What power source did you want on the compressor? Diesel or Electric and if electrical; what are the requirements?  Fixed Diesel Units

14.	Line item 0003. It says that travel required responsibility of contractor. Am I to understand that we are to provide flights and accommodations for the Students as well?  If the training is out of Iraq yes, if we go with the in Iraq we’ll get them there.
