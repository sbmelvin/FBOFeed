<DESC>MARKET SURVEY FOR ACQUISITION OF PUREACTIV SOFTWARE LICENSES AND ANNUAL MAINTENANCE IN SUPPORT OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION


NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING SPECIALIST.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

This is a market survey for information and comments from industry that will aid in the formation of an acquisition strategy for Pureactiv software licenses and annual maintenance in support of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The draft requirements are identified in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).

At this time, the Pureactiv brand is the only brand known that will suffice for the requirements of this acquisition.

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendorâ€™s expense.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest, capabilities, and rough orders of magnitude (cost estimates) from businesses interested in and capable of providing the required Pureactiv software licenses and annual maintenance. Respondents to this Market Survey are encouraged to provide comments regarding the governmentâ€™s approach to this requirement.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the potential acquisition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:

NAICS â€“ 511210 â€“Software Publishers
Size Standard - $38,500,000.00

The contractor will supply personnel and resources necessary to provide the Pureactiv software licenses and annual maintenance in accordance with the attached draft SOW.

Interested firms are required to submit a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

The FAA requires interested vendors to address the requirements in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). This document is provided for feedback and comments.

Each vendor should include the following information along with their submission:

1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:

- Type of supplies and support services that are Pureactiv branded or similar provided by your firm
- Size and type of Pureactiv supplies/services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and       
  provide detailed information and past performance)
- Number of years in business

2. Clearly state whether or not you can provide all of the types of supplies listed in the draft SOW.

3. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

4. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) or budgetary estimate for the items described in the draft SOW.

5. Please indicate if you possess an active GSA schedule which may provide this requirement. If so, please provide schedule number in response.  

6. Please indicate if pricing for such supplies and services can be found via company website, catalogue, or any other means that is publically available.  

All responses to this market survey must be received by 5:00 p.m. Central Time (Oklahoma Time) on January 11, 2018.

The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following:

Email: Joshua.d.huckeby@faa.gov

If email is your method of submission, please include "MARKET SURVEY RESPONSE: Pureactiv Software Licenses and Maintenanceâ€ in the subject line of your email.

<SOLNBR>75N91019R00002
<CONTACT>Jame Chang, Contracting Officer, Phone 240-276-5424, Email jame.chang@nih.gov - Rukshani Levy, Contracting Officer, Email rukshani.levy@nih.gov
<DESC><div><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.</strong><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) Initiative is a project of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to develop, implement, and manage a centralized model of IRB review for multi-site, NCI-sponsored clinical trials. The goal of the Initiative is two-fold: to streamline regulatory compliance and decrease the duplicative burden of protocol review that currently occurs at hundreds of local IRBs nationwide by providing a single, centralized review that can be utilized by local IRBs participating in NCI-sponsored multi-center trials; and to maintain and enhance the protection of research participants by providing consistent, expert IRB review at the national level.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Currently, the Initiative involves four CIRBs, the Adult CIRB - Late Phase Emphasis reviewing adult NCI-sponsored primarily Phase 3 treatment trials; the Adult CIRB - Early Phase Emphasis reviewing adult NCI-sponsored Phase 0, 1, 2 treatment trials; the Pediatric CIRB reviewing NCI-sponsored pediatric Phase 0, 1, 2, 3, and pilot treatment trials; and the DCP reviewing studies to evaluate cancer risk and to find methods to prevent those risks. The CIRB uses an independent model of IRB review where a local institution and principal investigators inform the CIRB about local context considerations, including local laws and requirements, via the submission of annual worksheets. Each CIRB reviews the NCI-sponsored trials within their purview and additionally reviews the local context considerations for each institution with investigators credentialed to participate in those trials.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The purpose of the contract is to provide the Government with the expertise in IRB and other Federal regulations, IRB operations, ethics, quality, information technology, and program management necessary to manage the NCI CIRB and support the institutions that rely on it.</div>
<p>Some of the major activities the awardee would perform shall include:</p>
<p>1.	Transition-In (if applicable) - The activities required to conduct a transition-in from the incumbent contractor that ensures an orderly, secure, and efficient transition of all contract activities and materials within 90 days of contract award.</p>
<p>2.	CIRB Central Operations - The activities required to run the daily operations of the boards and the studies they review.</p>
<p>3.	CIRB Local Operations - The activities necessary to address local context considerations at individual institutions. This function includes enrolling organizations and reviewing local context information.</p>
<p>4.	CIRB Helpdesk - The activities required to respond to inquiries via multiple channels of communication (e.g., telephone and email) with an average of 600 contacts/month. Most contacts are from enrolled institutions regarding local context issues.</p>
<p>5.	Communication and Education - The activities required to provide well planned, clear and consistent communications, which are essential to ensure smooth operations.</p>
<p>6.	Maintain AAHRPP Accreditation - The activities required to complete all requirements to maintain uninterrupted full accreditation status.</p>
<p>7.	Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Improvement - The activities required to conceptualize and implement a robust quality assurance and continuous quality improvement program.</p>
<p>8.	Provide IT software and support for all CIRB activities - The activities required to ensure all IT tools meet Federal IT requirements and are integrated with NCI Systems.</p>
<p>9.	Collaboration with other NCI contractors - The activities required to integrate with NCI processes, collaborate with other NCI contractors to achieve the requirements of the Statement of Work while simultaneously promoting and supporting other NCI contractors to address their requirements.</p>
<p>10.	Project Management - The activities required to maintain budget, scope, effectiveness and pace, and have physical documents pertaining to each specific task. The Contractor shall follow the standards and best practices of the Project Management Institute (pmi.org).</p>
<p>11.	Transition-Out - The activities required to transfer policies and procedures; transfer relevant files, records, materials, and data; all source code and object code developed, modified, and/or enhanced under the contract; and transition all activities to a new awardee.</p>
<p>12.	Options for Additional Level of Effort - The activities required to provide additional support to cover an expansion of work in the major task areas mentioned in all prior sections of the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competition. It is anticipated that one (1) level of effort cost plus fixed fee type contract will be awarded as a result of the solicitation with a base period of one (1) year plus four (4) additional one-year option periods, and ten (10) options for increased quantities beginning on or about September 1, 2019.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically on or about January 17, 2019 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. We encourage all responsible sources, particularly small businesses, to submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Program Executive Officer Space Systems and Navy Communications Satellite Program Office (PMW 146) intends to modify contract N00039-04-C-2009 to provide a within-scope increase in contract ceiling for MUOS engineering and interim logistics services, spares, and associated material and other direct costs.
Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302- 1, only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The incumbent provider, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), is the only responsible source able to satisfy the Department of Navy's requirements at this time. No alternative source can ensure continuity of service without major disruptions.  Contract N00039-04-C-2009, competitively awarded to LMSSC, provides for the design, development, and deployment of all MUOS ground equipment and software; the Common Air Interface MUOS waveform application; and the design, development, and on-orbit deployment of five MUOS satellites, spares, interim logistics services, and engineering services.
Required engineering services includes analysis of the MUOS baseline designs and the development and implementation of engineering changes to address evolving Information Assurance (IA) requirements, resolve operational performance issues, and operationally certify the system and the waveform.  Required Space Segment logistics support includes investigation and resolution of satellite anomalies, constellation maintenance, development of MUOS flight software updates, and performance analysis of all MUOS satellite subsystems.  These improvements are needed to complete Multi- Service Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&E) and achieve MUOS Full Operational Capability (FOC) as planned in FY20.

The space must be handicapped accessible, ADA compliant, and can be provided by new construction or modification to an existing space. If not a new building, the space offered shall be in a building that has undergone, or will complete by occupancy, modernization or adaptive reuse for the space with modern conveniences.
The space must be contiguous, on no more than one floor (ground floor preferable) and must meet or be able to meet the Department of Veterans Affairs Life Safety codes and other applicable regulations. A 20-year lease (10 years firm) will be considered. The VA seeks a modified gross lease that includes, but not limited to the following:

<p style="MARGIN: 3.05pt 22pt 0pt 14pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 127%">The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is conducting market research through the issuance of a Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of PMS 320 (the Electric Ships Office) seeking information from electrical equipment manufacturers, systems integrators, academia, and other interested parties to support the development of an electrical Energy Magazine for use in power systems applicable to naval warships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A key contributing technology for high powered directed energy weapons is stored energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The stored energy of the Energy Magazine is required to supplement typical ship service power so as to not put stochastic, large pulsed loads directly on the generator, which potentially damages the shipboard power system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Energy Magazine consists of power electronics, energy storage media, and controls combined together into one or multiple cabinets to enable directed energy weapons, electronic warfare, and sensors to meet shipboard distribution system requirements (such as MIL-STD-1399) while allowing multifunctional use of the energy storage assets. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Energy Magazine is a common, modular, scalable intermediate power system that could be used across multiple mission systems and ship installations. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Energy Magazine is a ship power "reloadable" magazine for multiple directed energy engagements that eliminates unique energy storage and power conditioning requirements for individual directed energy systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Energy Magazine provides stable backup power functionality and leads to reduction of uninterruptable power supplies (UPS).</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 3.05pt 22pt 0pt 14pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 127%">This announcement is a follow-on to the RFI posted under announcement N00024-17-R-4129 of April 19, 2017 and the feedback the Navy received from that RFI was considered in the development of the documents associated with this announcement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, since this equipment could be applied to future shipboard architectures, new versions of MIL-STD-1399 distribution interfaces are referenced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A separate RFI was issued to solicit industry comment on these interface standards (see announcement N00024-17-R-4202 of November 8, 2016).</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 3.05pt 22pt 0pt 14pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 127%">The Navy has developed draft performance requirements and desires industry review, feedback and recommendations addressing specific issues within the draft, as appropriate. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Energy Magazine is functionally allocated into two, physically separated cabinets; the Power Conversion Cabinet (PCC) and the Energy Storage Cabinet (ESC).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A boundary has been defined between the PCC and ESC and that interface is defined by an Interface Control Document (ICD).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This boundary will likely feature an unregulated 680 VDC to 1000 VDC bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The functionality allocated to the PCC includes power input and output to the loads and shipboard power distribution system, with an active front end enabling combined energy storage with a base load.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The functionality allocated to the ESC includes the storage media and any associated control (such as a battery management system); and cooling and ventilation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each cabinet is expected to have multiple sections internal to each cabinet to achieve all functionality allocated to each.</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 3.05pt 22pt 0pt 14pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 127%">The draft requirements are captured in a spreadsheet format of the Functional Requirements Document (FRD), which contains all performance requirements included in the specification; maps specified, derived, and verification requirements from source documents to the specification; and provides verification traceability at applicable test locations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FRD contains the generic Energy Magazine set of requirements that would eventually manifest as a performance specification; the specific set of requirements for the particular incarnation of an Energy Magazine thought to be of most value in an initial production, which would manifest as a set of ordering data (or slant sheet) to the generic Energy Magazine performance specification; and the particulars of the interface between the PCC and the ESC that would manifest as the ICD noted above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FRD contains controlled unclassified information and is therefore marked Distribution Statement D (Distribution authorized to Department of Defense (DoD) and DoD contractors only). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Therefore, the FRD can be provided upon request via email to Mckenzie Smith; <a>mckenzie.smith@navy.mil</a> and John Anderson III; john.anderson6@navy.mil upon verification that the requestor is a bona fide U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contractor familiar with the procedures to handle technical data packages that may include limited distribution information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidence in the form of a fully executed DD Form 2345 (MILITARILY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT), signed by both the US and Canadian representative, will be required prior to receipt.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE BOIS BRULE LEVEE RAISE AND SEEPAGE BERM. PLEASE ADRESS ALL QUESTIONS TO KRISTINA.J.BAKER@USACE.ARMY.MIL.
<p><br />SCOPE OF WORK<br />LEVEE RAISE AND SEEPAGE BERM<br />BOIS BRULE DRAINAGE AND LEVEE DISTRICT<br />1. Purpose:<br />This work effort is intended to restore the Bois Brule Levee and Drainage District to its authorized level of protection as well as construct a seepage berm for underseepage control. The scope of this project will only address two components of the 2003 Deficiency Correction Report. This work is to design the levee raise and assure it meets all necessary criteria for stability, settlement, seepage and other engineering considerations.<br /><br />2. Project Locations:<br />Bois Brule Levee and Drainage District, Perry County, Missouri.<br /><br />3. Background:<br />The Design Deficiency Correction Report including Environmental Assessment was completed in November of 2003, this document is comprised of multiple components each addressing a different deficiency within the Bois Brule Levee and Drainage District. The Levee Raise and Seepage Berm are two components. The main deficiency in the existing project is caused by problems with the underseepage design. In addition, the levee grade is inadequate in some sections of the back levee where the levee settled below net levee grade (intended design height). The net levee grade for the back levee along Bois Brule and Cinque Hommes Creeks was two feet higher than a profile based of backwater from the 50-year flood on the Mississippi River coincident with a 50-yr headwater flood on Bois Brule and Cinque Hommes Creeks. Underseepage design was completed by a series of spreadsheet analyses, relief well control and/or berm control was chosen for corrections as needed.<br /><br />The overall deficiency correct project includes; seepage relief wells, seepage berms, a clay-filled seepage cutoff trench, pumping stations, restoration of the levee to authorized grade, piezometers, ditching and culverts, and relocation of a public highway. All of the above listed components have been completed or are currently in construction with the exception of the two components described within this scope.<br /><br />4. Summary of Work:<br />USACE will perform the necessary data collection needed to design the restored levee sections. In the 2003 geotechnical design the seepage berms met the 1.6 factor of safety for underseepage, however reaches will be looked at more closely to ensure the levee section also meets the factors of safety within EM 1110-2-1913 for stability. Plans and specifications will be completed.<br /><br />The levee sponsor has obtained right of way for the 4.2 miles of back levee needed for the raise. The current plan developed for the deficiency report shows part of the raise as a landside raise and the remaining portion to be a creek-side raise. A hydraulic no rise study will be completed and compared to the hydraulic study in the 2003 report to ensure the creek-side raise will not impact the area negatively by inducing further flooding. Subsurface exploration will take place to acquire the information needed to complete stability analyses and other design requirements, such as settlement to ensure the levee sections will not be above the authorized grade. A factor of safety of<br />1.4 for stability will be required per EM 1110-2-1913. Plans and specifications will be completed for this effort.<br /><br />5. General Requirements:<br />Work should be performed in general accordance with USACE engineering manuals, technical letters<br />and best practices should be considered during the design. The design will be conducted by<br />personnel from MVS.<br /><br />6. Work to be Performed:<br />i. Development of Subsurface Testing Plan<br />a. Drilling and Testing Plan is attached<br />ii. Subsurface Exploration and Laboratory Testing<br />iii. Acquire Survey / Utility Locations<br />iv. No-Rise Study<br />v. Grading Design and Site Plan Development<br />vi.

No information shall be released by the contractor. Any request for information relating to this task order, presented to the contractor, shall be submitted to the CO for response.

CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA.  This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes.  The options are:
  Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
  VA s initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
  VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
  Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
  The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and

  Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation.  Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools.  Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the purchase order or contract.

  A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed.Â  The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures.  The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information.  If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.

Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:

   (1)  NOTIFICATION;
   
   (2)  ONE YEAR OF CREDIT MONITORING SERVICES CONSISTING OF AUTOMATIC DAILY MONITORING OF AT LEAST 3 RELEVANT CREDIT BUREAU REPORTS;
   
   (3)  DATA BREACH ANALYSIS;
   
   (4)  FRAUD RESOLUTION SERVICES, INCLUDING WRITING DISPUTE LETTERS, INITIATING FRAUD ALERTS AND CREDIT FREEZES, TO ASSIST AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS TO BRING MATTERS TO RESOLUTION; 
   
   (5)  ONE YEAR OF IDENTITY THEFT INSURANCE WITH $20,000.00 COVERAGE AT $0 DEDUCTIBLE; AND

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Sakura Finetek for description of product/service. These instruments are highly specialized to section human autoposy tissues and Sakura Finetek is the only one source that is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. These instruments are under our CLIA and QMS system and failure to be serviced by a vendor other than the manufactuer would require us to perform validation which would put an undue financial and time burden on our lab. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1).. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within five (5) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to William Brannen at VWL0@cdc.gov by 11:00 A.M. EST., January 7, 2019.</p>

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governmentâ€™s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, â€œdoing business asâ€ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business dayâ€™s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of Paymentâ€ paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractorâ€™s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of paymentâ€ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an â€œI agreeâ€ click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., â€œclick-wrapâ€ or â€œbrowse-wrapâ€ agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractorâ€™s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an â€œI agreeâ€ click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., â€œclick-wrapâ€ or â€œbrowse-wrapâ€ agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(c) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts with small business concerns, including subcontracts with small business concerns for the acquisition of commercial items.<BR><BR>a) This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C chapter 71, Contract Disputes.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officerâ€™s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractorâ€™s specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

(1)
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention toâ€”

(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is â€œlateâ€ and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; andâ€”

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerorâ€™s initial offer should contain the offerorâ€™s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

(3) The clause at 52.212-5.
(4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
(5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.

(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governmentâ€™s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, â€œdoing business asâ€ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business dayâ€™s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of Paymentâ€ paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractorâ€™s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of paymentâ€ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an â€œI agreeâ€ click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., â€œclick-wrapâ€ or â€œbrowse-wrapâ€ agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractorâ€™s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

(ii) Education, awareness, and other outreach to employees about the safety risks associated with texting while driving.

(d) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts that exceed the micro-purchase threshold.<BR><BR>(a) Method of payment.
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term â€œEFTâ€ refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to eitherâ€”
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the SAM database.
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractorâ€™s EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractorâ€™s EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible forâ€”
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.<BR><BR>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractorâ€™s EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, andâ€”
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractorâ€™s financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the SAM database.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 32.706-3, insert the following clause:

(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an â€œI agreeâ€ click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., â€œclick-wrapâ€ or â€œbrowse-wrapâ€ agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officerâ€™s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractorâ€™s specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

B. Solicitation Number: 36C10X19Q0036. This BRAND NAME OR EQUAL solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) using simplified and commercial item procedures identified in FAR Parts 13.5 (Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items) and 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items).

C. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-99 effective June 15, 2018 and the Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulations (VAAR). The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.

D. This requirement is a total (100%) set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs). To be eligible to quote, vendors must be verified in the Veteran Information Pages (VIP) at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/Default.aspx and small under the applicable NAICS code-337211, Furniture, office-type, padded, upholstered, or plain wood, manufacturing, (size standard of 1,000 employees).

E. Description of requirements:

STATEMNT OF WORK (SOW)
1.0 BACKGROUND
The Board of Veterans  Appeals (Board) is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  It is a roughly 1050-person organization located in Washington, DC.  The Board includes the Office of the Chairman, Office of the Principal Deputy Vice-Chairman, Office of Appellate Operations, and Office of Resource Management and Planning.  It provides direct service to Veterans and their family members by determining claims for Veterans benefits.

The Board's mission is to conduct hearings and decide appeals properly before the Board in a timely manner. The Board's jurisdiction extends to all questions in matters involving a decision by the United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs under laws that affect a provision of benefits to Veterans, their dependents, and/or their survivors. Final Agency decisions on such appeals are made by the Board based on the record in the proceeding and upon consideration of applicable provision of law and regulation.  The Board has jurisdiction over appeals arising from VA s Veterans Benefit Administration, Veteran Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration, and Office of General Counsel.  Although most appeals considered by the Board involve claims for disability compensation or survivor benefits, the Board also reviews appeals involving insurance benefits, educational benefits, home loan guaranties, vocational rehabilitation, dependency and indemnity compensation, health care delivery, burial benefits, pension benefits, and fiduciary matters.

The Board comprises of approximately 100 Veterans Law Judges (VLJs) and over 650 decision-writing attorneys.  The attorneys draft decisions for VLJ review, revision, and approval.  The Board is expanding from approximately 1000 FTE to 1125 FTE through FY2019.  The new hires will primarily consist of decision-writing attorneys who will support the VLJs.  These attorneys are critical to the Board s mission of issuing decisions in a timely manner.

The increase in FTE requires that the Board provide additional workstations for its employees.  Although some workspace requirements will be addressed through the Board s robust telework program and, relatedly, through office-space sharing, additional workspace is necessary to accommodate such a significant increase in hiring of new decision-writing attorneys.  Providing additional attorney workspace will allow the Board to grow while remaining in the same physical footprint it will facilitate improved service to US Veterans at an overall cost savings.

2.0   SCOPE OF WORK
The Government requires contractor support with furniture disassembly, purchase, and installation for space redesign.  The contractor shall meet set space dimension requirements as established by VA floor plans (attached).  The workspace modification furniture agreement covers office demountable partitions, case goods, modular and system furniture, storage cabinets, bookcases, file cabinets, seating, and general furniture available under established General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules (FSS).  Case furniture requirements are based on set dimensions and specifications provided by the Government.  CAD design drawings will be provided after the contract is awarded in addition to workstation prototypes.  The dimensions, shapes, and other criteria for the furniture are set forth in Attachment A: Technical Furniture Specifications.  The type and size of the two workstations (and the workstation components) that the Government intends to order are set forth in Attachment B: Typical Workstations.  Attachment C: Design Intent Drawings (DIDs) provides the layout of the three rooms for which furniture is being purchased. The finishes and color selections will be determined from manufacturer standard selection. The contractor shall deliver and install new workstations and workstation fixtures in accordance with furniture installation plans and specifications.

G.2 EVALUATION APPROACH

1. BASIS FOR AWARD

The Government intends to award a Single Contract to the responsible, lowest price, technically
acceptable (LPTA) Offeror that meets or exceeds the acceptability standards for all non-cost factors.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) SDVOSBs must be VIP verified in order to receive award. For each proposal received, the Government will evaluate the following factors:
Price
Technical Acceptability
   o Technical Capability
   o Past Performance
The process of selection will be the following: The Government will evaluate all price quotes first to
determine completeness.
After determination of completeness with regard to Price, the Government will rank the quotes from
lowest to highest price. Once the price quotes are ranked, the Government will evaluate the lowest
price Offeror s Technical Capability and Past Performance Volumes. If that Offeror is determined to be
Acceptable, the Government will select that Offeror as the awardee. If the lowest price Offeror is
determined to be unacceptable, the Government will evaluate the next lowest price Offeror and will
continue this process until the LPTA quote from a responsible vendor is identified.

Quotes determined to be unrealistic in terms of Price or Acceptability may be rejected at any time
during the evaluation process. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined
technically unacceptable.

The Government will review the required documents as outlined in the proposal volumes in F.1
Instructions to Offerors. A proposal that is determined to be incomplete or fails to fully meet any
material requirement may render a proposal unacceptable, thus ineligible for award.
The Government reserves the right to award with or without discussions based upon the initial
evaluation of proposals. As such, offerors are encouraged to submit their best proposal upon initial
submission.

2. PRICE EVALUATION

Price will not be evaluated adjectivally or assigned a score. Price will be evaluated to determine whether it is fair and reasonable. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. The Government expects that price reasonableness will be established through adequate price competition, but it may also determine price reasonableness through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 13.106-3. 

3. TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY EVALUATION

The Government will evaluate Technical Acceptability as follows:

The Technical Capability evaluation process will consider the extent to which the quote meets the
specified requirements set forth in the solicitation. The Government will evaluate the vendors quotes
based on their:

(a): Technical Capability: Quote must meet or exceed the acceptability standards for conformance to the requirements stated in the solicitation s SOW.

(b): Past Performance: Past Performance will be evaluated based on the narrative and other
Government sources for quality, timeliness, and relevance (i.e., experience in providing services similar
in size, scope, and complexity as described in the PWS). The Government will make determination of
relevance. For Past Performance to be found acceptable, all referenced Past Performance must be at
least rated as Satisfactory to be considered acceptable.

The offeror s initial proposal shall contain the offeror s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.
The Government reserves the right to make no award as a result of this solicitation.
G.3 VAAR 852.233-70 PROTEST CONTENT/ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (JAN 2008)

TIME SPECIFIED FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: 3:00 PM, EST <br />5.	POSITION TITLE: INL Senior Justice Advisor<br />6.	MARKET VALUE: $85,181 - $125,091 (FS-02 Equivalent)<br />7.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year from date of award, with four optional years<br />8.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina <br />9.	JOB DESCRIPTION:  See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT <br />The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of justice sector capacity-building programs for the U.S. Department of State.  INL programs in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) focus on reforming the criminal justice system in accordance with Euro-Atlantic standards through a sustained, multi-year effort.  INL has assisted the Government of BiH to reduce the backlog of war crimes cases; provide victim witness support; develop a track record of convictions against organized and transnational crime, corruption, and terrorism; enhance global and regional security; and improve law enforcement capacity to protect and serve the public.  INL will continue to provide such assistance and will also target opportunities to strengthen the capacity of civil society in counter-corruption practices and improve public trust in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>The Senior Justice Advisor (SJA) will lead rule of law programmatic efforts with the BiH State Prosecutor's Office (SPO).  The selected SJA will develop and implement programs to strengthen prosecutorial and judicial institutions throughout BiH (including the SPO, and entity, cantonal, and municipal prosecutorial and judicial institutions) in new, innovative, and sustainable ways.  The SJA will work with - yet independently of - the Resident Legal Advisor (RLA) from the Office of the Overseas Prosecutorial Development Assistance and Training (OPDAT).  Under Chief of Mission authority and INL Sarajevo supervision, the SJA will coordinate with INL's Office of Europe and Asia programs (INL/EA) to ensure efficient program management, to report host country developments impacting assistance programs, and to stay abreast of significant developments outside of BiH and the region that directly and indirectly affect U.S. government criminal justice and rule of law programs.</p>
<p>The SJA will track and analyze the impact of INL-provided assistance and will coordinate with other key stakeholders, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union (EU) mission to BiH, the United Nations mission to BiH, and other governmental and non-governmental donors as appropriate to prevent duplication and increase efficiencies.</p>
<p>Duties/ Responsibilities<br />1.	Maintain programmatic lead on all INL rule of law advising, training, and mentoring efforts at the SPO in coordination with the OPDAT RLA, other relevant Embassy sections, and international partners, as appropriate.<br />2.	Identify organizational and other impediments to effective prosecutions within the SPO and other prosecutorial and judicial offices, and work with relevant offices, other donors, and the INL Director and INL/EA to resolve.<br />3.	In coordination with USAID and other relevant Embassy sections and international partners, draft and implement a plan to reform the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (HJPC) to help it become more effective and less politicized. <br />4.	Identify existing administrative procedures and other regulations that can be used to more effectively combat corruption, organized crime, and other financial crimes, including asset seizure and forfeiture. <br />5.	Provide advisory assistance to the SPO and other prosecutorial and judicial offices in BiH to facilitate and encourage effective prosecutions for violations of Constitutional Orders and other State-level crimes.<br />6.	Identify systemic gaps preventing the equitable administration of justice at the State, Entity, Cantonal, and Municipal levels in BiH, and recommend trainings and other programs to address.  <br />7.	Provide ad-hoc legislative technical assistance as required. <br />8.	Provide regulatory technical assistance, particularly in updating relevant books of rules and other key guidelines.<br />9.	Assess SPO's media strategy, identify weaknesses, and assist in creating a modern public relations and outreach strategy to better explain the role of the SPO and the importance of the rule of law. <br />10.	Mentor select prosecutorial and judicial officials, to include case-based mentoring, as appropriate. <br />11.	Recommend programs to encourage increased cooperation with other states in the region, to include joint trainings and personnel and information exchanges, on issues of common concern. <br />12.	Provide other related advisory and training assistance as the position may require from time to time. <br />13.	If required, serve as Agreements Office Representative, Contracts Office Representative and/or Grants Office Representative for INL implementing instruments, and complete the training required for such roles.</p>
<p>TRAINING &amp; DISTANCE LEARNING COURSES<br />1.	Complete the Contracting Officer Representative (PA296) distance-learning (DL) course through the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) within 120 days of arriving at post.  <br />2.	Complete the Introduction to Working in an Embassy (PN113) distance-learning (DL) course through the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) within the first six (6) months of arriving at post.<br />3.	If applicable - Complete the mandatory Foreign Affairs Counter-Threat (FACT) Course (OT610) prior to deployment to post.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES/REPORTS<br />1.	The SJA will consult regularly with the INL Director and other U.S. officials and provide written and oral reports on a regular basis for inclusion in the INL Director's monthly update cable to Washington.  <br />2.	The SJA will participate in Post's Law Enforcement Council and other relevant meetings, and will evaluate the effectiveness of programmatic activities on a quarterly basis and make recommendations to the INL Director on any recommended changes.  <br />3.	The SJA will provide an annual report to the INL Director and INL/EA by September 30, to include a summary of key activities; discussion on coordination with other donors and positive examples of leveraging other donors' strengths; examples of significant challenges, achievements, and shortfalls; and recommendations for future work.  <br />4.	The SJA will submit a final end of tour report encompassing the same information as the annual report and including an overall tour summary.</p>
<p>RELATIONSHIP<br />The SJA is supervised by the INL Director at Embassy Sarajevo.  As a subject-matter expert, the SJA will provide advice and implement programs on behalf of the INL Director and INL/EA.  The SJA will also maintain open, timely, and effective communications with various Department bureaus and offices as required to build relationships that address problems with flexible, workable solutions.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) is delegated the authority to act for the Contracting Officer in matters concerning technical clarification, inspection and, after concurrence by the Contracting Officer, acceptance of Contractor performance under the contract, including preparation of receiving reports, and the authorization of progress payments when appropriate.  The COR will coordinate all work with the Contractor and review Contractor's performance at significant stages of its development.</p>
<p>In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms and the conditions or waive the government's requirement, price, delivery, or other terms and conditions.  Such changes must be authorized, in writing, to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>COMPLEXITY<br />INL programs are highly complex, multi-year, and focused on capacity-building.  Developing and implementing these programs requires excellent judgement, the ability to resolve critical problems, and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs.  Close coordination within the embassy and strong interpersonal skills are essential.  Programs are often characterized by large obligations of U.S. government funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny.  Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-term implementation and administration of the programs.  Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>
<p>SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS<br />The SJA will perform broad and extensive assignments with high visibility in a complex, dynamic political environment directly affecting the rule of law in BiH.  All activities must be closely coordinated with the embassy country team through the INL Director.  Programming activity could eventually span multiple layers of the state and within governmental institutions and include a wide range of justice sector capacity-building activities.</p>
<p>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS<br />1.	U.S. Citizen capable of attaining and maintaining a Secret security and medical clearance.<br />2.	A Juris Doctorate from an accredited US university. <br />3.	Demonstrated five years' experience as a prosecutor or defense attorney. <br />4.	Demonstrated three years' experience, at least one year of which specially relates to BiH, working in the prosecution of international war crimes, organized crime, and/or financial crimes.  <br />5.	Demonstrated record of successful state-level prosecutor capacity-building assistance in one or more countries of the former Yugoslavia. <br />6.	Demonstrable legal experience with asset forfeiture and other administrative tools to disincentivize illicit activities and remunerate victims of crime. <br />7.	Demonstrated record of working in a complex and highly charged political environment. <br />8.	Significant experience working and coordinating with relevant U.S. agencies and embassies, foreign governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations.  <br />9.	Superior interpersonal skills.<br />10.	Excellent oral and written English communication skills.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT<br />The SJA will be embedded in the BiH SPO.  Additionally, Embassy Sarajevo will provide desk space, a computer, office telephone, and other supplies as necessary at the embassy.  This property will be owned and maintained by the Department of State.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>FACTOR 1									(40 points)<br />Ability to manage rule of law advising, training, and mentoring programs with the State Prosecutor's Office in coordination with the OPDAT RLA, other relevant Embassy sections, and international partners, as appropriate.

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, â€œdoing business asâ€ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

NESC: http://www.standards.ieee.org/nesc<BR><BR>(a) U.S. and Coalition Commanders possess inherent authority to maintain law and order, provide security, and impose discipline necessary to protect the inhabitants of U.S. and/or Coalition installations, U.S. and Coalition personnel operating outside of installations, and U.S. or Coalition-funded developmental projects in Afghanistan. This authority allows commanders to administratively and physically control access to installations and/or project sites, and to bar contracts â€“ including prime contractors, subcontractors at any tier, and any employees, from an installation or site. A commanderâ€™s inherent force protection (FP) authority is independent of an agencyâ€™s contracting authority, and it may not be superseded by any contractual term or provision. 

(b) The prime Contractor/Vendor acknowledges that: submission of a bid, offer, or a proposal; acceptance of contract award of any type; or continuing effort under any contract that includes this clause; requires that the prime Contractor/Vendor, and all subcontractors under any affected contracts be initially eligible â€“ and remain eligible during the entire period of contract performance to include any warrant period â€“ for installation access to a U.S. and/or Coalition installation, regardless of whether the performance will take place on or off a U.S. or Coalition installation. 

(c) To be eligible for installation access, Contractors and subcontractors at all tiers are required to register for installation access in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) and are responsible for keeping the information in the this system updated at all times. Prime Contractors and subcontractors at any tier may verify their registration at https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/ by selecting the â€œVendors Loginâ€ module and logging in with their user name and password. The offeror must be registered, approved, and eligible for installation access prior to award, and remain eligible for installation access for the life of the contract.<BR><BR>(1) The offeror is required to submit a listing of all proposed subcontractors, at all tiers, to the contracting officer with the submission of the proposal, and provide updates during the life of the contract when subcontractors are added or removed. If no subcontractors are expected to perform during the life of the contract, the offeror must submit a negative response to the Contracting Officer with its proposal. After award, the prime contractor must submit a negative response to the contracting officer at the beginning of each performance period. 

(2) Failure to be approved in JCCS â€“ and thereby be eligible for installation access at the Prime and subcontractor levels â€“ or failure to inform the contracting officer of the names of all prospective subcontractors (or provide a negative reply), may render the offerors/contractor ineligible for award or continued performance. Additionally, any firm that is declared ineligible for installation access will be deemed non-responsible until such time as that firm is again deemed eligible by the appropriate access approval authority. 

(d) Installation access determinations arise from the Combatant Commanderâ€™s inherent authority and are separate and distinct from any law, regulation, or policy regarding suspension and debarment authority. Contractor queries or requests for reconsideration related to U.S. or Coalition installation base access eligibility must be directed to the authority responsible for base access decisions.<BR><BR>(a) USFOR-A FRAGO 10-200. United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) has directed that all shipments into and out of the Combined Joint Operations Area - Afghanistan (CJOA-A) be coordinated through the Defense Transportation System (DTS) in order to expedite the customs clearance process and facilitate the use of in-transit visibility for all cargo in the CJOA-A

1. The U.S Ambassador Afghanistan diplomatic note guarantees that the U.S. Government (USG) shipments are exempt from Afghanistan Customs duties and taxes. USG shipments do not provide commercial carriers with the authority to unnecessarily delay shipments or holdover shipments in commercial storage lots and warehouses while en route to its final destination. The U.S. Embassy expects that shipments will be expedited as soon as customs clearance paperwork is received from the respective GIRoA officials.<BR><BR>2. Imports: Documentation must list the year, make, model, and color of the commodity, the commodity Identification Number (if applicable) and for vehicles, the Engine Block Number.

a. Bills of Lading (for shipments by sea), Airway Bills (for shipments by air) or Commodity Movement Request (CMRs) (for overland shipments). In the consignee block, type in â€œUS Militaryâ€. This will help the Afghan Customs officials to recognize that the shipment belongs to the US Military and, therefore, the shipment is subject to tax exemption provisions as specified under the current Diplomatic Note or Military Technical Agreement (MTA). 
b. Shipping Invoices. 
c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo. 
d. An Afghan Government Tax Exemption Form (Muaffi Nama) purchased from the Department of Customs and Revenue and prepared in the local language by the carrier representative, shipping agent, or customs broker. 
e. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by DoD Customs, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions. Please note that DoD Customs is not responsible for registering vehicles. 
f. Commercially-owned equipment such as vehicles, construction machinery or generators that are leased and imported to Afghanistan for the performance of a USG contract may be subject to taxes and duties as determined by GIRoA. If commercially-owned equipment is imported into Afghanistan in a duty-free status, that duty-free status only applies as long as the equipment is under the exclusive use of the USG contract. If the equipment is released at the end of the contract, applicable GIRoA duties and taxes will apply to the owner if the equipment is not exported from Afghanistan or transferred to another USG contract. 
g. USG-owned vehicles must be exported at the conclusion of the project period or transferred to another USG entity. Under certain conditions, the USG may transfer equipment or vehicles to GIRoA. 

3. Exports: The following documentation is required for all export shipments: 
a. An original CCR prepared by the COR. If COR is not available, the Contracting Officer (KO) will prepare the CCR. 
b. Invoices. 
c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo. 
d. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by the DoD Customs Cell, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions.

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention toâ€”

(3) The clause at 52.212-5.
(4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
(5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.
(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governmentâ€™s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, â€œdoing business asâ€ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business dayâ€™s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of Paymentâ€ paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractorâ€™s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of paymentâ€ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an â€œI agreeâ€ click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., â€œclick-wrapâ€ or â€œbrowse-wrapâ€ agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractorâ€™s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:
(1) 52.203-19, Prohibition on Requiring Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statements (Jan 2017) (section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractorâ€™s EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractorâ€™s EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible forâ€”
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.<BR><BR>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractorâ€™s EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, andâ€”
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractorâ€™s financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the SAM database.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 32.706-3, insert the following clause:
Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations (Jun 2013)

(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an â€œI agreeâ€ click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., â€œclick-wrapâ€ or â€œbrowse-wrapâ€ agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officerâ€™s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractorâ€™s specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 33.106, insert the following provision:

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>1.	Introduction and Background</p>
<p>MCC's mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in select developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles, of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results.</p>
<p>Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. Our Values are CLEAR: Embrace Collaboration, Always Learn, Practice Excellence, Be Accountable and Respect individuals and ideas. MCC's values define how we behave on a daily basis, both as individuals and as an institution, in pursuit of our mission. They guide how we make decisions, set priorities, address challenges, manage tradeoffs, recruit and develop staff, and work together with our country partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>2.	Scope of Position</p>

<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSCs is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSCs is subject to most of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances and financial disclosure.

<p>1.	Introduction and Background</p>
<p>MCC's mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in select developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles, of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results.</p>
<p>Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. Our Values are CLEAR: Embrace Collaboration, Always Learn, Practice Excellence, Be Accountable and Respect individuals and ideas. MCC's values define how we behave on a daily basis, both as individuals and as an institution, in pursuit of our mission. They guide how we make decisions, set priorities, address challenges, manage tradeoffs, recruit and develop staff, and work together with our country partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>2.	Scope of Position</p>
<p>This position is located in the Human and Community Development Unit (HCD), Sector Operations Division, within the Department of Compact Operations (DCO). DCO is responsible for developing and implementing MCC's compact programs.

<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSCs is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSCs is subject to most of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances and financial disclosure.

<p>Position Information: 	Two full-time, Personal Services Contractors (PSCs): One Associate-Director-level and one Director-level.<br /> One Base year (2,087 hours per year), renewable for up to 4 Option years at the sole discretion of the government (a total of 10,435 hours over five years).</p>
<p>Pay Band:	Associate-Director-level Pay Band 3B ($39.77 - $72.02 per hour) or Director-level Pay Band 3A ($55.10 - $82.46 per hour)<br /> https://www.mcc.gov/careers/pay-bands<br /> The PSCs may receive a pay supplement of up to 15% of the employee's direct labor cost in lieu of fringe benefits.</p>
<p>Closing Date for Questions:	2:00PM ET on 8 January 2019 (Tuesday)<br /> Questions must be submitted via email to leeae@mcc.gov</p>
<p>Submission Deadline:	5:00PM ET on 24 January 2019 (Thursday)<br /> Or as amended depending on the US Federal Government furlough.<br /> Quotes must be submitted via email to leeae@mcc.gov</p>
<p>Position Security Level:	Secret Clearance (Noncritical Sensitive/Moderate Risk (T-3))</p>
<p>Who May Be Considered:	U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Duty Location:	Performance in Washington, DC USA.</p>
<p>Set Aside:	This requirement is set-aside for individuals (small business concerns) under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services with a size standard of $15,000,000 in revenue. The award will be considered for individuals that satisfy this set-aside, not for firms.</p>
<p>Type of Contract:	Time-and-material (T&amp;M) with 1 Base Year and 2 Option Year Periods.<br /> Multiple awards may result from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Submission and Award:	The Government intends to hire one Associate Director PSC and one Director PSC. The Government will evaluate the received quotes on the first week of each month (the first round of evaluation will occur the first week of January 2019). The Government intends to extend this RFQ until either or both positions are filled. MCC may close the RFQ once qualified PSCs are selected. Offerors are permitted to apply to either Associate-Director-level or Director-level position or both levels (if qualified for both positions) for MCC's consideration. An offeror cannot fill both positions however; MCC will award two awards to two separate individuals.</p>
<p>Amendment 1:	The purpose of Amendment is (1) to answer questions by interested offerors and (2) to clarify the submission deadline. Due to the US Federal Government lapse in FY2019 Appropriations, MCC will shut down starting 3 January 2018 and thus the submission deadline may be affected. MCC's intent is for the quote submissions to be due by 5:00PM ET on 24 January 2019 (Thursday); however if MCC is unable to timely address the questions (due by 2:00PM ET on 8 January 2019), then MCC may consider extending the submission deadline.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, MCC will not be allowed to work during the furlough period (or also called "shutdown"). MCC will not be able to make amendments to this RFQ until the US Federal Government reopens. Please check this RFQ on FBO.gov after the US Federal Government reopens. If MCC decides to extend the submission deadline, MCC will amend this RFQ within 5 business days from the reopening date. Unless this RFQ is amended, interested offerors shall assume that the questions and the quote submissions deadlines remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The interested offerors are responsible for staying updated on the current US Government furlough/shutdown status and submit your quotes timely. Please read the US news and https://www.opm.gov/ regarding furlough/shutdown information.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>1. Will MCC consider offerors who are not US Citizens?<br />A: No, MCC cannot consider offerors who are not US Citizens. This is a MCC Security requirement to allow MCC to conduct a complete background check on the offerors.</p>
<p>2. Will MCC permit full-time telework?<br />A: No, the duty station for this PSC will be Washington, DC. These positions require administering contracts as well as domestic and international travel, which would make the logistics difficult and expensive for MCC.</p>
<p>1.	Introduction and Background</p>
<p>MCC's mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in select developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles, of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results.</p>
<p>Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. Our Values are CLEAR: Embrace Collaboration, Always Learn, Practice Excellence, Be Accountable and Respect individuals and ideas. MCC's values define how we behave on a daily basis, both as individuals and as an institution, in pursuit of our mission. They guide how we make decisions, set priorities, address challenges, manage tradeoffs, recruit and develop staff, and work together with our country partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>2.	Scope of Position</p>
<p>Our model is defined by principles of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results. Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. MCC's values are CLEAR - Collaboration, Learning, Excellence, Accountability and Respect. We recruit staff that will embody and uphold these values.</p>
<p>This position is located on the Program Procurement Practice Group, Sector Operations Division within the Department of Compact Operations. The Program Procurement Practice Group oversees the procurement activities required to implement an MCC-funded Compact.

<p>3.	Personal Services Contract</p>
<p>MCC is authorized to enter into a contract with an individual as a Personal Services Contractor (PSCs) under the authority of Section 614(a) (8) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003.</p>
<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSCs is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSCs is subject to most of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The following elements apply to this contract:<br />(1)	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />(2)	Principal tools and equipment may be furnished by the Government.<br />(3)	Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission.<br />(4)	Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel.<br />(5)	The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year.<br />(6)	The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to-<br />(i)	Adequately protect the Government's interest;<br />(ii)	Retain control of the function involved; or<br />(iii)	Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee.</p>
<p>4.	Key Requirements</p>
<p>Awardee must satisfy the following key requirements:<br />&bull;	U.S. citizenship.<br />&bull;	Must be able to obtain and maintain a federal security clearance.<br />&bull;	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />&bull;	Domestic and international travel will be required.<br />&bull;	Statement of Employment &amp; Financial Interest (e.g., Office of Government Ethics "OGE Form-450" or similar statement) may be required.<br />&bull;	Active System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) registration (this is a free, Government website) and be listed as sole-proprietor.<br />&bull;	Designated and/or random drug testing required.</p>

<p><br />SCHEDULE/REQUIREMENT<br />CLIN 0001<br />Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide all Labor, Material and Equipment for Services to Create Captions and Transcripts for 94 Videos Containing 3,847 Minutes in Accordance with the Attached Statement of Work<br />Quanity:&nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />Unit:&nbsp;&nbsp;JB<br />Price:&nbsp;&nbsp; $_______________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Statement of Work<br />Video Captioning <br />Purpose: Create captions and transcripts to video content (mp4 files) Video Captions for 94 videos containing 3,847 minutes that will be posted on geodesy.noaa.gov to educate the public about geodesy, coastal mapping and other National Geodetic Survey (NGS) activities.</p>
<p>Justification: NGS must provide information about its products and services in order to meet its mission of providing access to the National Spatial Reference System. It is expensive for both end-users and NGS employees to travel to meetings and conferences, so the NGS public website geodesy.noaa.gov is often the most efficient way to distribute information. Additionally, video content (mp4 files) posted to the website has added value because the combination of text or images with narration can assist in explaining technical and complex material. However, the mp4 files posted to the website should be captioned or posted with a transcript in order to comply with Section 508 of the National Rehabilitation Act. <br />Section 508 states that, "When developing, procuring, maintaining, or using electronic and information technology, each Federal department or agency [...] shall ensure, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the department or agency, that the electronic and information technology allows, regardless of the type of medium of the technology, individuals with disabilities [...] to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access of [those] who are not individuals with disabilities."<br />NGS has hosted numerous webinars and now manages a monthly Webinar Series. The current library of recorded webinars (each about 1 hour in length) needs to be captioned and posted online in conjunction with a transcript to ensure all users can benefit from these educational materials. To ensure the successful completion of this task, NGS requires the assistance of professionals to create captions based on existing mp4 files and provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor will have access to the mp4 videos through an FTP site (NOS) that will be provided upon award.<br />&bull; The contractor will deliver a "perfected" caption file in the .SRT format. Perfected means:<br />o 99% accuracy of the words spoken by the moderator and speaker;<br />o 99% accuracy with respect to the timing of mp4 versus timestamping in the caption file;<br />o Text edited for grammar and spelling.<br />&bull; The .SRT file must include: <br />o A number showing the subtitle's order in the series, starting with 1.<br />o The time that the subtitle starts, followed by --&gt; and the time it ends.<br />o The subtitle text.<br />o A blank line to show where the next subtitle begins.<br />&bull; The contractor will provide a separate "perfected" transcript file, removing all numbers, timestamps and unnecessary spacing from the caption file. The transcript will be an editable text document.<br />&bull; NGS will provide the unedited mp4 file with the video and audio recording. NGS will also provide the accompanying slide decks (e.g. powerpoint slides) that were used in the webinar to assist with "perfecting" the content because a lot of the words are technical in nature.<br />&bull; Minimum of 600 minutes per week each QA/QC within a week of delivery.</p>
<p><br />IT Security Requirements<br />The Assessment and Authorization (A&amp;A) requirements of Clause 48 CFR 1352.239-72 do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.<br />The contractor will not access, store, process or transmit any government privileged information. The contractor will not have access to any non-public government information, systems and/or networks.<br />1) The contractor must ensure all NOAA information and contractor solution resides within the United States.<br />2) All electronic provided information by the contractor must undergo malicious software scanning using a commercial anti-virus and anti-spyware software to ensure the information is free of known malicious software. The contractor must work with the COR prior to sending the information to establish a secure method for transfer (see NOS-ftp in previous section). <br />3) The contractor agrees, in the performance of this contract, to keep the information furnished by the Government and designated by the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative in the strictest confidence. The contractor also agree not to publish or otherwise divulge such information in whole or part, in any manner or form, nor to authorize or permit others to do so, taking such reasonable measures as are necessary to restrict access to such information while in the contractor's possession, to those employees needing such information to perform the work provided herein, i.e., on a "need to know" basis. The contractor agrees to immediately notify the Contracting Officer in writing in the event that the contractor determines or has reason to suspect a breach of this requirement. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the contractor must securely remove all copies of the files developed for this acquisition.</p>

<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304, NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">Synopsis</div>
</div>
<p>Amendment 4</p>
<p>The purpose of Amendment 4 is (1) to issue updated Terms of Reference (ToR) dated 20190102 and (2) to clarify the submission deadline.</p>
<p>Firms must acknowledge Amendments 1, 2, 3, and 4 in their Cover Letter. Firms may simply state, "Firm ABC acknowledges Amendments 1, 2, 3, and 4."</p>
<p>This version of the ToR updates the Section 1.2.6 Stakeholder Engagement to include a minimum level of anticipated stakeholder engagement work. The changes are highlighted in yellow and noted in Track Changes.</p>
<p>Due to the US Federal Government lapse in FY2019 Appropriations, MCC will shut down starting 3 January 2019 and thus the submission deadline may be affected. MCC's intent is for the submissions to be due by 5:00PM ET on 4 February 2019 (Monday); however if MCC is unable to timely address the questions (due by 1:00PM ET on 4 January 2019), then MCC may consider extending the submission deadline.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, MCC will not be allowed to work during the furlough period (or also called "shutdown"). MCC will not be able to make amendments to this Synopsis until the US Federal Government reopens. Please check this Synopsis on FBO.gov after the US Federal Government reopens. If MCC decides to extend the submission deadline, MCC will make an amendment before the submission deadline or within 5 business days from the reopening date, whichever is later. Unless this Synopsis is amended, interested offerors shall assume that the questions and the submission deadlines remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The interested offerors are responsible for staying updated on the current US Government furlough/shutdown status and submit your SF-330 timely. Please check the US news and https://www.opm.gov/ regarding furlough/shutdown information.</p>
<p>Any changes to the previous version of the synopsis are highlighted in the body in yellow.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>[End of Amendment 4]</p>
<p>Amendment 3</p>
<p>The purpose of Amendment 3 is (1) to extend the Submission Due Date to 5:00pm ET on 4 February 2019 (Friday), (2) to answer several questions posed by interested bidders, and (3) to issue updated Attachment a.1 Terms of Reference (ToR) 20181227 (Microsoft Word) [Official]. This Amendment 3 revises the answers to Amendment 2 Questions 1 and 2. Please note the information in this Amendment 3, including the Attachments, supplants any conflicting information you may found in previous versions of this Synopsis. Any changes to the previous version of the synopsis are highlighted in the body in yellow. Any changes to revised version of the ToR are noted in the Track Changes.</p>
<p>We have made some changes to the ToR, including the removal of one task (formerly 3.1.4.2) and its associated deliverable (Deliverable 14). We also added language regarding the bachelor's degrees for engineering positions at the senior level, namely that the degrees shall come from accredited engineering institutions. We provided the names of the accreditation institutions with links for verification in the US, Canada, France and international agreements (Washington Accords and CTI).</p>
<p>Firms must acknowledge Amendments 1, 2, and 3 in their Cover Letter. Firms may simply state, "Firm ABC acknowledges Amendments 1, 2, and 3."</p>
<p>Questions and Answers (Q&amp;As):</p>
<p>1.	Requirements for the Pavement Engineer (s) (P. 58 of the ToR): "S/he shall have a Masters' degree in Civil Engineering with specialty in concrete pavements and high modulus asphalts." To our knowledge, this specialty is acquired rather after years of practice. Would you consider lowering the education requirement?<br />A: Section 5 paragraph 7 allows for the substitution of years of experience for a Master's degree.</p>
<p>2.	TOR 5.2.1 page 57: Can PM/TL's two projects over $175 million count toward the requirement that s/he must have led at least three projects over the past 10 years? In other words, is three total projects acceptable, or is MCC looking for five total projects for the PM/TL?<br />A: The two (2) urban infrastructure projects valued at over $175 million can be counted as part of the three (3) projects over the last ten (10) years.</p>
<p>3.	Can MCC provide a copy of WSP's VGE integrated model?<br />A: MCC would require a legal approval to release this model, which may significantly delay this procurement. We also don't believe this is critical for bidders to prepare their submission. Therefore, this will not be shared with the interested bidders. However, it will be made available to the awardee after the award.</p>
<p>4.	Does a cost loaded implementation plan with WBS need to be provided for the purposes of this qualifications-based submittal?<br />A: No. this will need to be provided with the financials as part of the second phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>5.	Who will have primary responsibility for developing the Stakeholder Engagement Plan - the ESOC or the A&amp;E? (There seems to be conflicting references to SEP preparation on pages 9 and 16 of the TOR.)<br />A: The A&amp;E has total responsibility for planning and conducting all Stakeholder Engagement for all activities that are conducted under their contract scope. The ESOC has responsibility for the Project-wide Stakeholder Engagement Plan as required under the IFC PS and MCC, of which the Stakeholder Engagement program of the A&amp;E is a part. The ESOC will need to capture and document what the A&amp;E does in the larger Project-wide Stakeholder Engagement Plan and the A&amp;E will need to share information and collaborate with the ESOC on its approach and results. Note on page 17 of the ToR, it states, "The A&amp;E shall provide a preliminary stakeholder engagement plan including stakeholder mapping for completing the requirement." Therefore, this is consistent and correct.</p>
<p>6.	Who will have primary responsibility for developing the Training course - the ESOC or the A&amp;E? (There seems to be conflicting references on pages 9 and 13 of the TOR.)<br />A: The two training courses and objectives are different. Additional clarification is provided in revised ToR with this Amendment. Each consultant is responsible for their own course content development.</p>
<p>7.	Who shall bear the costs of stakeholder engagement expenses such as venues, media adverts and information materials?<br />A: The A&amp;E shall bear the costs of stakeholder engagement expenses such as venues, media adverts and information materials for all Stakeholder Engagement activities that are conducted under their contract scope. Page 10 of the ToR has been modified to reflect this.</p>
<p>8.	One of the requirements for the key personnel is to have a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and/or construction engineering. In some non-US countries, the degree is not called bachelor and not always civil, construction. Could the wording be modified to Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering or similar?<br />A: Yes, this has been adjusted. Note that MCC reserves the exclusive right to evaluate what constitutes similar; as such the firm shall provide supporting evidence to help inform the MCC appropriately.</p>
<p>9.	Can the A/E proposed different dates for the deliverables as long as the Base and Option Period do not go beyond the timeframe proposed by MCC? Also, can the A/E include additional deliverables not listed in the ToR?<br />A: Yes, the A&amp;E is encouraged to propose different dates for deliverables. The A/E may propose additional deliverables, however the MCC reserves the right to accept or decline the proposal.</p>
<p>10.	General Review and Approval Question. Please specify that the NTE Due dates provided in the schedules of the RFP are for DRAFT deliverables, which will begin the review "clock" ticking, and NOT for Final deliverables having undergone the 4-week pre-submission review process.<br />A: The dates provided are for approval of the deliverables. See Question No. 9 above. The A&amp;E may modify the deliverables schedule as long as they fit in the period of performance provided.</p>
<p>11.	It is stated that the A/E must possess an average of at least $100 million USD in total annual revenue over the last five years. Please clarify if the $100 million refers to revenue from design and/or from construction. Some design firms do not provide construction services.<br />A: This refers to annual revenue generated by the prime contractor's architecture and/or engineering design work.</p>
<p>12.	TOR Page 44. 4.2 Deliverables. The RFP specifies that the official language of all deliverables is in French; however, also references translation requirements. Later, MCC requests that Monthly Reports be provided in both French &amp; English. Please clarify language requirements for all primary deliverables as French only. (Only Deliverables 1 and 2 specifically note the French language requirement.)<br />A: Section 4.4.2.1 Base Period Deliverables notes that all deliverables are in French unless otherwise noted. This clarification has been extended to Section 4.4.2.2 Option Period 1 Deliverables.</p>
<p>13.	TOR Page 44, 4.3 Review of Work. Please consider changing the deliverable review and time schedule to a set time frame, such as "Total deliverable review and finalization will be no more than 28 calendar days, which begins at the time the draft final is delivered to the MCC, MCA and appropriate organizations for review. Review organization have 14 calendar days to provide comments for inclusion or discussion, at which time the A&amp;E has 14 days to include, discuss and revise the draft to Final. If reviewing organizations do not meet the 14-day deadline, the A&amp;E is not obliged to include them. The A&amp;E is responsible to keep record of and time stamp all received comments. This system does not preclude the A&amp;E from eliciting informal feedback and comments during the drafting process." <br />A: This change has been provided in the ToR.</p>
<p>14.	TOR Page 45. 4.3.1. and 4.3.2 CTCTR Monthly Progress &amp; Design Review Meetings. MCC requires that the CTCTR meetings include videoconferencing. Please confirm that publicly available systems, such as Skype or Zoom can be used for this purpose. <br />A: Publicly available systems are permissible as long as they provide a high quality videoconferencing environment with proper audio and video quality for all participants.</p>
<p>15.	TOR Page 46. Monthly reports. In this section of the RFP, MCC request that the monthly report must include a detailed time sheet for all personnel documenting in and out of country time. However, MCC has defined the contract terms as Firm Fixed Price, or FFP. Under FFP contracts, detailed time and costs are not required to be reviewed, presented or approved. Please clarify this requirement under the standard terms of a FFP contract structure. <br />A: This monthly report is to allow quality management by MCC. This is not to confirm the cost or invoice; this is to ensure that the contractor is providing a quality work as they proposed and negotiated.</p>
<p>16.	TOR Page 44-47. Inception Report. The RFP states the draft Inception Report is due two weeks prior to the kick off meeting but the Abidjan Kick Off, and the final report is due within two weeks of the kick off meeting. Yet, the RFP states the Inception Report is Due at Week 10. The dates do not seem to coincide appropriately.<br />A: As noted in the Deliverables Timeline 4.4.2.1.10 Base Period Deliverable Timeline and 4.4.2.2.6 Option Period 1 Deliverable Timeline, the deliverable timelines are indicative and will be proposed and finalized by the A&amp;E.</p>
<p>17.	TOR Page 18. Task 3.1.2.1.1 Data Collection. Traffic counting data is not detailed in this task. Data is supposed to be collected for traffic counts, OD, safety assessment, injuries and fatalities, truck parking needs and land availability. Only OD survey is detailed. Other types of data seem to be rather requested in further tasks.<br />A: As noted in Section 3.1.2 Multimodal traffic demand and simulation model for the Project Zone of Influence, the objectives of the task are to perform data collection to develop a Traffic Demand and Simulation Model and develop a multimodal traffic demand and simulation model for trip generation, trip assignment, modal distribution and trip assignment. The A&amp;E shall develop a methodology to accomplish this task accordingly.</p>
<p>18.	TOR Page 27. 3.1.5.1 Conceptual Design. Traffic Assessment asks to perform a specific detailed traffic counts (during AM and PM peak periods, while it is not specified in Data Collection. Does this traffic count different from the one asked in Task 3.1.2.1.1 Data collection?<br />A: The A&amp;E must propose, justify, and implement a data collection plan as part of the mandate. MCC believes traffic counts are necessary.</p>
<p>19.	Data Collection. Can you confirm the Data collection for deliverable 4 includes only the road sections from figure 2 (excluding Boul de la Paix and Yopougon)?<br />A: The Project Zone of Influence is detailed under section 1.2.2 Project Zone of Influence. Figure 2 is provided as a partial reference material for the Project Zone of Influence.</p>
<p>20.	Traffic Counting. Does the MCC expect the A/E to complete the traffic counting only with Deliverable 8-Conceptual Design at week 32?<br />A: Data collection results and simulations (to account for various network development scenarios or deviation plans) are required for the conceptual designs. The data collection may be performed earlier if needed.</p>
<p>21.	Due Date. When is the Preliminary ESIA and Resettlement Report due and what is the required content?<br />A: The A&amp;E shall include relevant ESIA and Resettlement information in the Preliminary Design Documents as outlined under Section 3.2.1.4. Deliverables found under section 4.4.2.2.1 Deliverable 9 note preliminary ESIA and resettlement risks and results shall be included.</p>
<p>22.	Deliverable. Can you clarify the requirements in terms of Preliminary ESIA and resettlement in Deliverable 8 and Deliverable 9? From the deliverable descriptions (section 3.1.5.7 and section 4.4.2.2.1.1), both deliverables 8 and 9 should include the preliminary ESIA and resettlement assessment. Please provide details of what is expected.<br />A: Section 3.1.5.7 Conceptual Design is modified to summary ESIA and resettlement assessments, while 3.2.1 Preliminary designs and its deliverables under Section 4.4.2.2.1 Deliverable 9 note preliminary ESIA and resettlement risks and results shall be included. The Conceptual Design ESIA elements are meant to highlight the major aspects that may influence the overall design selection; the preliminary design is a more completed version of the selected conceptual design with more refined resettlement, environmental and social risks and measures identified.</p>
<p>23.	Preliminary Estimates and types of PAP. What was the methodology used to estimate the preliminary number and type of PAP? What were the criteria used to distinguish permanently and temporarily displaced PAP?<br />A: It should be emphasized that the estimates of the number of PAPS are indicative only and NOT definitive. The presence of PAPs and the estimate of number of PAPS was assessed through counts made using satellite imagery coupled with windshield survey and intermittent on the ground counts. The difference between permanently displaced and temporarily displaced PAPS is that permanently displaced PAPs will not be able to resume their activities in their original location post-project completion.</p>
<p>24.	Overlap ESOC-A&amp;E. Could you clarify the responsibility of the A&amp;E vs the ESOC:</p>
<p>a)	The ESOC should develop training courses for the MCA and CTCTR, 6 courses X 16 h, all of them have the same topic as the 36h-classes provided by the A&amp;E. Can you clarify the differences between both training programs?<br />A: The ESOC courses are generalized courses meant to provide a general awareness and understanding of each of the selected topics in anticipation of the A&amp;E modules, which are meant to be more specialized and focused on providing the CTCTR with sufficient understanding to participate in the engineering design phase and to deliver the road projects during the Compact period as noted in paragraph 1 of 3.1.4.1 Training for the CTCTR.</p>
<p>b)	Who, between the A&amp;E and ESOC, is responsible to coordinate the engagement and effort of INP-HB and ENSEA?<br />A: The ESOC is responsible for engaging with the INP-HB and ENSEA for their six (6) modules, while the A&amp;E is responsible for coordination with INP-HB and ENSEA, with support from MCA-CI, for its ten (10) modules.</p>
<p>c)	What is the effort expected from INP-HB and ENSEA for those training programs? Should the A&amp;E plan a budget for local professors in addition to international trainers?<br />A: The INP-HB and ENSEA have separate budgets from the A&amp;E. Note that the A&amp;E is expected to provide the training itself and not through professors from either institution. Note that professors from both institutions may be present during the modules.</p>
<p>[End of Amendment 3]</p>
<p>Amendment 2</p>
<p>The purpose of Amendment 2 is (1) to issue the details of the Synopsis Conference held on 27 November 2018, (2) to extend the Questions Due Date to 1:00pm ET on 4 January 2019 (Friday), and (3) to issue updated attachments. For the overview of the Conference, refer to the Synopsis Attachment f. Synopsis Conference Presentation.

<p>This Amendment also includes the following attachments: Unofficial Terms of Reference in French 20181218, Updated LoEs by Deliverables, and Unofficial Synopsis Conference Presentation. The Unofficial Terms of Reference in French and the Unofficial Synopsis Conference Presentation are for reference purpose only. If there are any discrepancies among the documents, the information from the Official Terms of Reference and the Synopsis supplant the unofficial documents.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Firms must acknowledge Amendments 1 and 2 in their Cover Letter. Firms may simply state, "Firm ABC acknowledges Amendments 1 and 2."</p>

Firms are required to reference and use the most up-to-date Attachments from the latest amendment for their submissions. Please periodically check the FBO announcement at the following link for any revised Attachments:</p>
<p>https://www.fbo.gov/spg/MCC/MCCMCC/MCCMCC01/95332419E0001/listing.html</p>
<p>6.	How should firms confirm that the submission is valid for one year?<br />A: Firms may simply note "The submission is valid for one year" in the Cover Letter.</p>
<p>7.	In the Synopsis Section 1. Background, what does it mean by "The estimated cost range for the construction project is to exceed $10,000,000"?<br />A: This is simply a prescribed set of ranges per FAR 36.204.</p>
<p>8.	Is an SF-330 Part II required for each office where key personnel reside?<br />A: Yes. SF-330 Part II is required for each office that will be involved in this project.</p>
<p>(The complete SF-330 template has a set of instructions on how to complete the form. On page 4 of Instructions, it says to submit SF-330 Part II for the firm and each of its "branch office seeking work if the firm has branch offices.")</p>
<p>9.	How soon does MCC expect to receive the top firm's cost proposal once the firms ranking is established?<br />A: Once the solicitation (RFP) is issued to the top firm, we will expect to receive the cost proposal in two weeks.</p>
<p>10.	What is the expected award date?<br />A: MCC hopes to make the award in March of 2019.</p>
<p>11.	Who does the MCC expect to be present at the presentation/interview?<br />A: The Team Lead must be present either in person or virtually (if virtually, she/he must have a reliable connection to communicate with MCC clearly). Ideally, MCC would like all the Key Personnel members to be present, but this is not required.</p>
<p>12.	General Format. Please confirm that use of 11x17" paper for charts, graphics, and matrices is approved, and will only count as a single page within the allotted page count.<br />A: Yes. Up to five 11x17" with 1" margins pages will be permitted in Section H Additional Information for charts, graphics, matrices, or any other visual representations. These pages shall not include extensive written descriptions of your technical approach (as a general rule of thumb, if these pages reserved for visuals include paragraphs of information, we will disregard them during our evaluation). Each 11x17" page will count as one page towards the 30-page limit.</p>
<p>13.	Are resumes only required for the six key personnel or do we need to include resumes for all personnel listed on the organizational chart?<br />A: The resumes must be submitted for both key and non-key personnel that are listed on the organizational chart.</p>
<p>14.	Format of CV. In the RFP Public meeting, MCC specified offerors do not have to follow the Section E resume template; rather, should ensure that the required information is included in the CVs provided. Please confirm this to be correct.  Also, please confirm there is no page limit, nor limit on number of CVs included in Section E. <br />A: That is correct. As long as the required information is included, Section E resume template is not required for submission. If Section E template is not used, the resumes shall be compiled and submitted as a separate electronic file, collective of all relevant resumes, on 8.5x11" paper with 1" margin. There is no page limit to resumes.</p>
<p>15.	Where in the SF-330 should firms incorporate the Commitment Letters?<br />A: You may include all the Commitment Letters as a separate attachment to the SF-330 Section E. Resumes of Key Personnel Proposed for this Contract. As a reminder, there is no page limit for Commitment Letters.</p>
<p>16.	Does MCC want a confirmation of the A-E firm's commitment to this project from an authorized officer of the firm?<br />A: Yes. The Cover Letter shall include a statement from an executive of the proposing firm confirming their commitment to actualizing the proposed and negotiated plans, including the team members. Firms may simply include a statement in the signed Cover Letter, "Firm ABC confirms the commitment of carrying out our proposed and any negotiated technical plans, including mobilizing and maintaining the proposed team members."</p>
<p>An attempt by the contractor to alter the technical plans after award may not be considered favorably by MCC and may result in a termination for default.</p>
<p>17.	Would MCC consider limiting the number of projects under SF-330 Section F. Example Projects which Best Illustrate Proposed Team's Qualifications for This Contract? How should firms reflect the multiple projects?<br />A: Yes. The total number of projects in Section F shall not exceed 10 projects. Firms must complete a copy of SF-330 Section F for each project proposed, i.e. if proposing 5 projects, the firm must complete the Section F five times, one for each project.</p>
<p>18.	Can firms provide past performance references of the subcontractors?<br />A: Yes. MCC expects at least three (3) past performance references of the prime firm. The firm may choose to submit additional past performance references of its subcontractors if they have performed similar projects, in size and scope, in the past.</p>
<p>19.	The Qualification Factor 4 asks for at least 3 past performance references in a format that differs from SF-330 Section F. Will MCC clarify this?<br />A: The Qualification Factor 4 has been revised to require at least 3 but no more than 10 past performance references to match the requires of SF-330 Section F (refer to Question no. 4 above). Firms must submit at least 3 references for the prime contractor. Firms may submit 1 or 2 references for each of its subcontractors and the total number of subcontractor references may not exceed 7 references.</p>
<p>The Qualification Factor 4 has been revised to reconcile SF-330 Section F.</p>
<p>20.	Would MCC consider limiting the SF-330 Section G. Key Personnel Participation in Example Projects to the proposed Key Personnel only?<br />A: Yes. The Section G may comprise of example projects participated by the proposed Key Personnel only.</p>
<p>21.	Section G. Section G states Key Personnel be included only in the matrix. Will MCC allow Key and other Core Technical Experts be included to illustrate experience level more appropriately?<br />A: The minimum requirement is to complete Section G of the proposed Key Personnel. However, firms are permitted to include other Core Technical Experts (no junior-level staff) in Section G to illustrate a more complete picture of its proposed team's professional qualifications. Doing so may result in a higher rating for the Evaluation Factor 1 Proposed team professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.</p>
<p>22.	Can firms re-phrase the Team's roles as stated in the ToR?<br />A: No. As noted under 5.b. Submission Requirements and Instructions, "A restatement of the ToR will be deemed unacceptable and may result in a low evaluation rating."</p>
<p>23.	How much of the contract would be performed before/after the Entry-into-Force (EIF)?<br />A: The EIF is the point in time when a Compact or Threshold Program Agreement comes into full legal force and effect and its term begins. MCC estimates the EIF may take place in middle of 2019, but there is no certainty as of now so we cannot estimated this performance split.</p>
<p>24.	What is MCC's expectations on the team mobilization plan?<br />A: The team mobilization plan shall demonstrate the proposed teams mobilization and timing to complete the assignment per the proposed workplan and overall approach and methodology. Firms shall consider, among other items, how the proposed team will be initially mobilized to Abidjan to begin the assignment in earnest.</p>
<p>25.	Subcontracting Plan. In an SF 330, a proper Subcontracting Plan is generally not included, due to the costing content required therein. Will MCC consider dropping this requirement for the SF 330 submission, until prior to negotiations at which time all costs, etc can be revealed?<br />A: MCC is not seeking a formal Subcontracting Plan with the cost information. MCC wishes to verify that the prime contract has a management plan on (1) how it will oversee the subcontractor's performance and (2) what its plans are in case of subpar performance.</p>
<p>26.	Page 7 of ToR, asks for the LoEs less administrative effort. There may be uneven comparison by removing the administrative effort.<br />A: We have changed this requirement to propose the Total Estimated LoE Percentage per Deliverable. Refer to the Attachment c. LoEs by Deliverable. We are no longer seeking a total number of hours per deliverable. The sum of all the LoE percentages (including the Base Period and Option Period 1) must equal 100% and shall reflect the total hours, including both technical and administrative hours, in the calculation.</p>
<p>27.	Is there a detailed contract deliverables review and approval process?<br />A: Yes, it can be found in the ToR Section 4. Deliverables and Documentation Requirements.</p>
<p>28.	Are firms permitted to propose cost-cutting and/or value engineering methods?<br />A: Yes. Firms may propose innovative cost-cutting and/or value engineering methods that can improve the Government's requirement in Section H. Additional Information. However, this synopsis phase is strictly a technical evaluation phase and SF-330 does not allow any cost information. Therefore, firms must take care not to submit any specific cost detail. General explanations of the methods are permitted but any numbers associated to cost or even inferences that can be made to any specific cost numbers are prohibited. MCC will not advise the firms whether or not their language would be permissible before the submission due date. Firms should consult the permissible language with their legal counsel.</p>
<p>29.	Would MCC consider giving a range for the expected number of team members? Firms could propose a very effective technical approach but it could be very expensive.<br />A: No. We want the interested firms to determine the most effective and efficient team structure.</p>
<p>30.	Would MCC consider providing a range of the estimated contract value? Providing some parameter would assist firms to better prepare the submission.<br />A: Periodically, MCC updates our Business Forecast on our website. According to our Forecast, the estimated contract value for this A-E service is between $10,000,000 and $20,000,000 (https://www.mcc.gov/resources/doc/eport-business-forecast-fy-2018-mid-year).</p>
<p>This is a pure estimate and does not bound interested firms to prepare a technical approach within this range. This information is strictly for referential purpose and not a strict requirement. MCC expects the firms to submit the best, realistic, and fair and reasonable technical submissions based on their own assessment of MCC's requirement.</p>
<p>31.	During the contract performance, it may be necessary for the contractor to access various areas of the project. What would happen if there are any accessibility issue?<br />A: If the said issue arises from the fault of the Government, we will absolutely consider modifying the contract for reasonable equitable adjustments. If the issue/delay could have been resolved or avoided by the contractor, any additional costs incurred would be assumed by the contractor.</p>
<p>32.	Has there been any further determination on the site of the truck parking?<br />A: The World Bank is currently conducting a study. The site detail has not yet been established.</p>
<p>33.	Regarding the Key personnel, the terms indicate the team leader should have led and manage two similar projects valued at 175 million USD each, which is fairly high threshold for projects dealing with urban networks requalification in developing countries; would any other relevant projects be considered in the evaluation of the team leaders if projects credentials are below that threshold, while still being significant for developing countries (for example: projects within the range of 75-80 million USD)?<br />A: No. But to clarify, the projects do not have to be from developing countries. The US$175 million is for any construction projects at such value. This is to ensure a team lead who have handled similar projects in size and scope as MCC's project.</p>
<p>34.	Regarding the key-experts and their presence on site, should we consider a minimum share of their man-days to be spent in Ivory Coast?<br />A: The firm shall propose how they anticipate staffing and maintaining the appropriate level of in country presence to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>35.	Some project activities might imply generating and selecting some preferred options regarding these projects, and the consultant's level of effort might vary depending on the option(s) that will be selected (for example: Option period 1, activity 2 : "To prepare preliminary designs for the four road projects"); it is our understanding that these variance in the level of efforts would be discussed at a future stage of the selection process, once the preferred technical proposal has been selected; can you confirm this?<br />A: Yes. MCC is open to negotiating points such as this with the highest rated firm(s) during the solicitation phase.</p>
<p>36.	In relation with Attachment c. Level of efforts by deliverables: it is our understanding that the total LOE estimation presented in that table will actually correspond to the total level of efforts of all activities specific to the deliverables; can you confirm our understanding? How would you recommend that LOE related to common tasks (such as project management, etc.) be considered?<br />A: LOE shall be presented for each deliverable as a percentage of the sum total of LOE for the Base and Option Period 1, including both direct and indirect (administrative) hours.</p>
<p>37.	Levels of Effort (LOEs): we understand that the total man-hours of personnel should be provided by deliverable; do we also include support staff (administrative) and surveys team (traffic counts, technical and socio-environmental investigations...)?<br />A: Please note the required LoEs by Deliverables spreadsheet now requires the percentage of total LoEs, instead of number of hours. The percentages are to be the absolute total, including support staff.</p>
<p>38.	The terms indicate the training sessions should be meant for groups of 30 to 50 attendees. Such a big group size may impact negatively the quality of the interaction and learning. Would it be possible to reconsider the size of the groups and to reduce them to 15 to 20 attendees or to expand the number of training sessions (i.e. more or less to double them) for that purpose?<br />A: MCC agrees the training would be more effective with smaller group size. MCC agrees that the class size shall not exceed 40 participants. MCC will evaluate the firms' approach on how they will implement the training sessions.</p>
<p>39.	The proposal evaluation factors and criteria are very clear; in addition, how will the relative importance of each factor or criteria be assessed and evaluated, to produce the overall evaluation and ranking of the proposal?<br />A: MCC will use adjectival rating system per Synopsis Section 7. Evaluation Criteria. We will not use a numeric system to rank the important of the evaluation factors. Those firms that rate more highly on the more important factors, e.g. Professional Qualification, Methodology and Workplan, and Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, would be more favorable to MCC than those firms that rate more highly on the less important factors, e.g. Past Performance and Knowledge of the Locality.</p>
<p>40.	Regarding the synopsis, English seems to be the working language. But based on ToR deliverables must be in French. Would you please confirm the submission could also be submitted in French?<br />A: The SF-330 submission must be in English.</p>
<p>41.	Regarding the applicable standards for the conceptual and preliminary design, we understood from the terms of reference, that the A&amp;E was expected to provide a list of relevant standards (for instance North American and European, cf page 16 and 30). However we found the sentence "Final Designs are per US Standards" confusing. Could you please clarify whether or not the A&amp;E is expected to propose the most relevant standards, North American, European or local standards?<br />A: The final design standards are defined by level of completeness of the design per U.S. design standards.</p>
<p>42.	The Evaluation Factor 3 requires the following, "An average of at least $100 million USD in total annual revenue over the last five (5) years, totaling at least $500 million USD over the five (5) year period (reference date of issue of the solicitation)." This restricts the competition to very large firms. Please confirm that the $500 million USD is the revenue of A-E/Construction services by the Prime Contractor only and whether or not MCC would consider easing this requirement.<br />A: This value is for the prime contractor only and MCC is not consider easing this requirement, which will help us ensure sufficient experience in similar size and scope as MCC's requirement.</p>
<p>[End of Amendment 2]</p>
<p>Amendment 1</p>
<p>The purpose of Amendment 1 is to issue the updated ToR. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>

(SF-330 Part I Section E Resumes of Key Personnel Proposed for This Contract is not considered in the page limits provided.)</p>
<p>The Phase I Qualifications submission must not include any price/cost information as it will not be reviewed during our Phase I Qualifications evaluation.</p>
<p>The firms must provide all the necessary materials, equipment, personnel, etc. to satisfy the requirement. There is a possibility, however, that the MCA may offer an office space for limited number of contractor personnel. This will be separately negotiated before or after the award.</p>
<p>The submissions must clearly demonstrate in English the firm's qualifications and the understanding of the technical requirements for further consideration. Clarity and completeness are of the utmost importance. Therefore, the submissions, including all illustrative and graphical representations, must be presented in a practical, clear, and concise manner.</p>
<p>The narrative must provide the Government with a reasonable assurance that the firm has the necessary qualifications to fully satisfy the Government's requirements. A restatement of the ToR will be deemed unacceptable and may result in a low evaluation rating.</p>
<p>The Government recommends completing and signing the SF-330s electronically, rather than handwriting then scanning. If any part of the submission is not clearly readable, i.e. a document is not legible or comprehensible, the Government may either disregard the information in our evaluation or deem the submission unresponsive without an opportunity for re-submission.</p>
<p>The submissions must clearly demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Government's requirement, as well as convey the A-E firm's capability for transforming its understanding into successful performance.</p>
<p>5.c.	Standard Form 330 (SF-330) and Required Submissions Documents</p>
<p>The SF-330 Parts I and II are standard documents used for the A-E firms to present their qualifications to the Government. Both parts and all its sections must be submitted electronically for award consideration. Only the SF-330 Part I Section D Organizational Chart of Proposed Team and Section H Additional Information may be submitted as Microsoft Word (.docx) and Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) documents (to allow graphical representations and to conveniently present additional information) as long as it does not exceed the page limits noted in 5.b. Submission Requirements and Instructions.</p>
<p>If a Word/Excel document is used, the font must be Calibri or Times New Roman size 11 or larger and page size must be 8.5x11" with 1" margin all around. The first page of Section H must be completed as the original SF-330 PDF document with the appropriate signature and the remaining pages may be presented in Word/Excel. All supplemental documents should clearly show sequential page numbers and the corresponding section title, e.g. "Section D Organizational Chart of Proposed Team" or "Section H Additional Information." All other sections must be completed within the SF-330 PDF. The firm may complete multiple copies of the PDFs for SF-330 Part I Sections A through H and Part II to ensure sufficient documentation of its qualifications.</p>
<p>In the synopsis phase, MCC will evaluate the following:</p>

<p>5.e.	Blocked and Unacceptable Electronic File Types</p>
<p>Due to current cybersecurity threats, MCC currently blocks attachments containing extensions that run programs. These include any files that contain or are executables, macros, and other extensions that present a threat. As such firms must not use any of these file extensions and remove all macros from Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel) or their submission will be blocked, preventing receipt of the submission by MCC and potentially being precluded from award consideration.</p>
<p>The following are examples of file types that are blocked, however this list is not exhaustive or fully-inclusive as additional, similar file types may be blocked in the future:</p>
<p>.vbs (Microsoft Visual Basic script file)<br />.vbe (VBScript encoded script file)<br />.scr (script)<br />.reg (registration file)<br />.jar (java file extension)<br />.exe (executable)<br />.docm (Word with macros)<br />.xlsm (Excel with macros)<br />.pptm (PowerPoint with macros)<br />.app (executable)<br />.ani (animation files)<br />.ace (data compression archive file format used by WinAce)<br />.ico (image file format)<br />.js (java script)<br />.zip (compression file)</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is an agency of the United States Government under the Department of Health and Human. NIH's mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to improve human health, extend life, and reduce illness and disability. The NIH comprises twenty-seven (27) separate Institutes and Centers that have intramural research programs.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA), the NIH established a significant technology transfer program that includes the management, patenting, and licensing of inventions with commercial potential originating from research conducted at said intramural research programs. The patent-related legal services NIH's needs in pursuing patent protection for some such inventions and may also include ancillary intellectual property related services.&nbsp; Generally and as applicable to the proposed contract, NIH's day-to-day technology transfer operations are divided into nine (9) centers housed within the National Cancer Institute; National Center for Advancing Transitional Science; National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; National Human Genome Research Institute; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The current nine centers conduct technology transfer operations for the Institute or Center which houses them as well as acting as service centers for other NIH Institutes or Centers that do not have in-house technology transfer operations.</p>
<p>NIH expects to file about 200-300 patent applications each year. NIH's current active patent prosecution docket is more than two thousand and five hundred (2,500) cases.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Program Executive Officer Space Systems and Navy Communications Satellite Program Office (PMW 146) intends to modify contract N00039-04-C-2009 to provide a within-scope increase in contract ceiling for MUOS engineering and interim logistics services, technology refresh to replace obsolete replaceable components that are no longer produced, technical logistics data updates/revisions, spares, associated material and other direct costs.
Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302- 1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The incumbent provider, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), is the only responsible source able to satisfy DON requirements at this time. No alternative source can ensure continuity of service without major disruptions. Contract N00039-04-C-2009, competitively awarded to LMSSC, provides for the design, development, and deployment of all MUOS ground equipment and software, the Common Air Interface MUOS waveform application and the design, development, and on-orbit deployment of five MUOS satellites, spares, interim logistics services and engineering services.
Required engineering services includes analysis of the MUOS baseline designs and the development and implementation of engineering changes to address evolving Information Assurance (IA) requirements, resolve operational performance issues, and operationally certify the system and the waveform. Required Space Segment logistics support includes investigation and resolution of satellite anomalies, constellation maintenance, development of MUOS flight software updates, and performance analysis of all MUOS satellite subsystems. These improvements are needed to complete Multi- Service Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&E) and achieve MUOS Full Operational Capability (FOC) as planned in FY20.
The Government is not soliciting proposals in response to this synopsis.
The solicitation will be issued without further notice.
The Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.
Questions should be directed to LT Tiara Anderson at telephone (858) 537-8531 or via email at tiara.c.anderson@navy.mil.

<DESC>Synopsis:

This notice is a Notice of Intent (NOI).  This notice is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1) requiring dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions.  This is a Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Firm-Fixed Price Contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b) - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements., and is not a request for competitive quotes.   The Department of Veterans Affairs, Employee Education Services intends to award a firm-fixed price sole source contract to The contractor (Joint Accreditation for Interprofessional Continuing Education (JA) as managed by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education [ACPE]) 135 S La Salle St, Chicago IL 60603. This contract will include:

1. Title of Contract:  Joint Accreditation  for the Interprofessional Education (ACPE/ACCME/ANCC/AAPA/COPE/APA/ASWB) application for its  Provider  rights to Employee Education System (EES).

2.  Scope of Work:  The contractor (Joint Accreditation for Interprofessional Continuing Education (JA) as managed by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education [ACPE]) shall provide all resources; equipment and supervision to provide EES with a full Joint Accreditation for Interprofessional Education.  Contractor shall provide the annual maintenance for seven accreditation service/bodies.     

EES has successfully completed and contracted with the contractor as required for the mandatory  eligibility review/application review  for three accreditations ( American Nurses Credentialing Center / ANCC,  Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education /ACCME, and  Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education /ACPE) with contractor.  In addition to these same three, EES now requires four additional ( American Academy of Physician Assistants /AAPA, Council on Optometric Practitioner Education /COPE,  American Psychological Association /APA, and Association of Social Work Boards /ASWB) medical accreditation services.  

This is required so Joint Accreditation can simultaneously accredit medical, pharmacy, and nursing continuing education through a single, unified application process, fee structure, and set of accreditation standards. There are steps and necessary condition in order to meet the stringent requirements of the seven-separate medical governing bodies.  EES provides its continuing medical training with its largest seven (7) accreditations:  Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC), American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA), Council on Optometric Practitioner Education (COPE), American Psychological Association (APA), and Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB).  

3. Background:   Healthcare professionals from a multitude of clinical areas i.e. general practitioners, allied health services, specialties and sub-specialties require maintenance of a valid  licensure.  In order to maintain the individual professional  license , clinicians must stay abreast on cutting edge medical information and treatment protocols.  Currently, EES contracts with ACPE, ACCME, ANCC, AAPA, COPE, ASWB, and APA to serve as a designated provider of pharmacist, physician, nurse-specific, psychologist, social worker, physician assistant, and optometrist approved continuing education.  These institutions are EES s critical centerpiece target audience of EES s educational products and services, serving over 100,000 clinicians in total; this represents roughly 60% of the clinicians served by current EES accreditations.  Only those EES training events pertinent to each clinical disciplines count towards meeting the specific license requirements.  Continuing education is a structured educational activity designed or intended to support the continuing development of the clinician and their healthcare extenders to maintain and enhance their competence.  Historically EES has provided the VHA clinicians over 1 million Accredited learning hours/ compliance annually with the ACPE, ACCME, ANCC, AAPA, COPE, APA, and ASWB.  These seven accreditations approvals are needed in order for EES to continue to issue CE for its physicians, pharmacists, optometric professionals, psychologists, nurses and other ancillary professional staff that attend/complete EES training events/programs.  

In 2019, American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA), American Psychological Association (APA), Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB), and Council on Optometric Practitioner Education (COPE), have coupled their services with the Joint Accreditation. 

Currently EES is required to individually and separately manage and oversee the ACPE, ANCC, ACCME, AAPA, COPE, APA, and ASWB accreditation review, scheduling, and payment services.   This is a heavy manpower/man-hour burden on the EES accreditation team as well as the ancillary support employees.  Conservatively speaking, at least 500+ man-hours are required by government to manage and oversee these separate accreditation bodies.  An eligibility review is the first step necessary to merge the seven accreditations into one service/focal point for all things related to ACPE, ANCC, ACCME, AAPA, COPE, ASWB, and APA accreditation review, billing and renewal services in the future.  It s estimated that joint accreditation approval will significantly reduce the man-hours necessary to manage these accreditations.
   
4. Period of Performance:  Period of performance shall be from 1 February 2019 thru 31 January 2020.     The government requires an additional four (4) government option years that shall run concurrently with the base award.  These option years shall be used to maintain EES s annual accreditation status of the ACPE, ACCME, ANCC, AAPA, COPE, APA, and ASWB accreditations.  Unless specifically authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, no services will be provided and no charges will be incurred and/or billed to any order on this contract on any of the Federal Holidays listed below.
