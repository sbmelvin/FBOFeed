However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for research and development support for the Fast Light Optical Gyroscopes for Precision Inertial Navigatio project. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Northwestern University for the following reasons: 1) The Fast Light Optical Gyroscopes for Precision Inertial Navigation project was originated and conceived in part by a Northwestern University researcher. The project is a culmination of years of effort by the Northwestern University team, developing the requisite technologies, laboratory techniques, and theory that are fundamental and critical to the success of this research and development effort. No other sources have the comprehensive knowledge of the scientific and engineering subtleties of the topic required for successful completion of the project. Based on the publication record from Northwestern University, duplication of such experience would take at least 6 years of effort. 2) Northwestern University has developed custom unique equipment, devices, and test beds that will be leveraged and utilized for the Fast Light Optical Gyroscopes for the Precision Inertial Navigation project. The time, effort, and cost associated with duplicating these items would significantly delay and impact the project. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 25,2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

<DESC>Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, and inter- or intra-agency transfers depending on the nature of the proposing organization and/or project requirements. The period of performance for an award may be one to five years. Note that it is NASA policy that all investigations involving non-U.S. organizations will be conducted on the basis of no exchange of funds. An optional pre-proposal teleconference will be held on Feb 20, 2013 from 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Prospective proposers are requested to submit any questions in writing to CP4SMP@jpl.nasa.gov no later than 4 business days before the teleconference so that NASA will be able to cover as much information as possible at the teleconference. NASA plans to post written questions and answers and teleconference charts to the NSPIRES website. An opportunity to ask questions and solicit clarification will be provided in the teleconference. To dial into the teleconference, call 1-888-469-1385. The participant passcode is CP4SMP. For relay services for the hearing impaired, call 711 at least 30 minutes before the call is to begin. Only non-profits that are legally recognized by a federal, state or local authority, including all types of NASA Visitor Centers (e.g., private, state or federal entities) located in the United States or its Territories that provide science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education programming (such as but not limited to exhibits) are eligible to apply for this NASA Research Announcement (NRA). An eligible institution does not need to have the words museum, visitor center, science, or planetarium in its legal name. No later than the due date for proposals, proposers to this NRA are required to have: 1)	a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, 2)	a valid registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) [formerly known as the Central Contractor Registry (CCR)], 3)	a valid Commercial And Government Entity (CAGE) Code, 4)	a valid registration with NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) (this also applies to any entities proposed for subawards or subcontracts.) Consult Section VII. Eligibility Requirements of this NRA for the complete detailed explanations and caveats related to institutional and all other eligibility criteria. Principal Investigator Requirement: Principal Investigators (PIs) must be the President, Vice President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chairman of the Board, or similarly ranked executive (e.g., Planetarium Director, Director of Sponsored Research) from an eligible institution. Limit on Number of Proposals per Organization: Eligible organizations shall submit only ONE (1) proposal per DUNS number. If an eligible organization submits more than one proposal using the same DUNS number, then none of the proposals will be evaluated. The NASA Office of Education, in cooperation with NASA Headquarters Offices of Communications and Chief Technologist, Mission Directorates (i.e., Aeronautics Research, Human Exploration and Operations, and Science), and Mission Support Directorate solicits proposals to support NASA-inspired space, science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (S-STEM) informal education projects, including exhibits and partnerships with K-12 schools or districts, to support inquiry-based education. This NRA or solicitation seeks projects featuring NASA-themed content in space exploration, aeronautics, space science, Earth science, or microgravity, or a combination of these topics (See Section III of this document) to support NASA education outcomes. Leadership of the proposed projects must reside at informal education institutions (IEI); partnership relationships are highly encouraged (See Appendix C for partnership discussion). Proposed projects should address NASAs most current Strategic Plan and propose efforts that are well-aligned with NASA and do not duplicate other federal investments. Proposals also should address substantiated (e.g., through an existing needs assessment or other evidence) national, regional or local educational needs or challenges and offer solutions with potential for significant impact. Examples of eligible projects include but are not limited to: exhibits (permanent, traveling, or virtual); STEM programming serving educators, students, youth, parents, and the general public; STEM programming for informal education providers and staff professional development (e.g., youth groups, out-of-school-time programs, youth group leaders, workshop or activity leaders, curriculum developers, docent managers, exhibit designers, library professionals, community education leaders, education and public outreach (EPO) professionals); informal learning research in STEM, informal education programs, data usage and analysis; curriculum support for informal science education, technology development, performing arts, or activities that are culturally focused on targeted populations, such as women and minorities. Grantee institutions have the responsibility for budgeting and documenting compliance with Code of Federal Regulations, 14 CFR1230, commonly referred to as the Common Rule for the Protection of Human Subjects. Research to develop NASA-themed exhibits, programs, curriculum products, etc., may involve full human subjects review through an Institutional Review Board or IRB or it may be exempt. An IRB also certifies when research is exempt. Every institution that intends to submit a proposal to this NRA, including the proposed prime award or any partner whether an informal education institution, other non-profit institutions, state and local Government agencies, and other organizations that will serve as subawardees or contractors, must be registered in NSPIRES. Electronic submission of proposals is required by the due date and must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. All principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators) must be registered in NSPIRES regardless of submission system. Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) of interest to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. Electronic proposals may be submitted via the NASA proposal data system NSPIRES or via Grants.gov. Organizations that intend to submit proposals via Grants.gov must be registered 1-- with Grants.gov and 2--with NSPIRES. Additional programmatic information for this NRA may develop before the proposal due date. If so, such information will be added as a Frequently Asked Question or FAQ or formal amendment to this NRA and posted on http://nspires.nasaprs.com	   . It is the proposers responsibility to regularly check NSPIRES for updates to this NRA. When the CP4SMP+ portal page on NSPIRES is updated a notice will be added to the NASA Education Express weekly news service.

The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan.  <br>  <br> To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the Instructions on the website, no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 14, 2013.  No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.  <br>   <br> Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process.  The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit technology demonstrations for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal.  Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by ESTCP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether ESTCP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal.  Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, ESTCP will not provide debriefs to those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. <br>  <br> Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification.  A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.  There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any  cost incurred by the offeror before contract award is made for a demonstration.  Multiple awards may be made to address a particular topic area.  It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $10 million will result, depending on availability of funds.   <br>  <br> Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions' participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value.  If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees and $4.5M respectively.  Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA) Small Business Office website at http://www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate. <br>  <br>  <br> Points of Contact:   <br>  <br> Procedural Questions - SERDP, Ms. Jina Banks-Saunders, 571-372-6565;  <br>  <br> Contract Questions - HECSA, Ms. Susan Hill, Susan.M.Hill@usace.army.mil or 703-428-6420;  <br>  <br> Small Business Participation Plan or Subcontracting Plan - HECSA, Mr. Kyle Beagle, kyle.j.beagle@usace.army.mil or 703-428-7385.  <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br> US Army Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity  <br> ATTN: CECT-HC, 7701 Telegraph Road Alexandria, VA, 22315-3860, US <br>

As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number.

Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information.

Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The United States Air Force (USAF) is deploying a replacement radar automation system to its OCONUS air bases. This system is the Standard Terminal Automation System (STARS). STARS displays radar data for the purpose of controlling air traffic in the terminal environment. STARS connects to outside facilities via the Inter-Facility Data Transfer (IFDT) interface. Since STARS is designed to interface with FAA Centers, it does not have the capability to interface with host nation Area Control Centers (ACCs) at OCONUS installations. This incompatibility results in the inability to exchange flight data or perform automated radar handoffs with host nation automation systems. It is the intent of the Program Office to procure an Automatic Protocol Exchanger to enable STARS to connect to host nation ACCs for the purpose of exchanging flight data and performing automated radar handoffs. This system is called APEX.

<DESC>TITLE: Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) Follow-On Contract Sources Sought/Capability Request for Information
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR QUOTE. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Respones to this RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this sources sought does not preclude participation in any future and potential solicitation. It is the intent of the Contracting Office to use the information collected for market research purposes only. If a formal solicitation is released, it will be via the Federal Business Oppertunities website (http://www.fbo.gov). The Government shall not reimburse the costs of preparing responses to this request for information. Only responses from US companies will be accepted. Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Engine CIP is a program that establishes a prioritized list of projects each calendar year for engineering and test support as defined and agreed to by the Major Commands (MAJCOMs). Projects include developing engineering changes to the engines, developing organizational, intermediate and depot level repairs as needed, and designing modifications to existing support equipment as well as initiating new support equipment designs as required by engine driven changes. CIP also provides support to resolve service revealed deficiencies and maintain or extend the life limits of aircraft engines.<br />The Component Improvement Program has a very long and very distinct history dating back to the mid 1950s. It is the only program of its kind which provides development and sustainment support for the active inventory of aircraft engines. Since CIP is a tri-service program with involvement from the Army and Navy, the lead service for a particular engine is responsible for improvements to that engine. This prevents duplication of efforts.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall conduct a continuing engineering and test program at the Contractor's facilities, at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) Tinker Air Force Base OK, at San Antonio Air Logistic Center (SA-ALC) Kelly Air Force Base TX, at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) Edwards Air Force Base CA, at the Eglin Air Force Base Climatic Test Facilities Eglin Air Force Base FL, and at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) Arnold Air Force Base TN. The Contractor shall identify, fabricate, qualify and deliver the first article as identified under the Government approved Engineering Project Description (EPD) in order to support engine related changes, complex and non-complex support equipment and overall improvements in system performance, reliability and maintainability.</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE: <br />The Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) Branch at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking potential responsible business sources to provide optimal solutions to the objective of Engine CIP. <br />The Government is seeking responsible firms to furnish the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address. <br />(2) Business size (if 8(a) provide proof of certification, etc.) under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541712. <br />(3) Under which NAICS does your company usually provide supplies identified above? Do you consider a NAICS code other than 541712 to be more appropriate as a classification for the supplies identified above? Please include the rationale for your answer. <br />(4) Which of the following would you see as your role in the performance of a potential requirement of this nature (ref: the above requirements)? (a) Prime Contractor; (b) Subcontractor; or (c) Other, and please describe. <br />(5) What contract type do you recommend for the established requirements, and why?<br />(6) What are your capabilities/strengths with respect to performing the Engine CIP mission?<br />(7) The Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient, demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting). The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. (2) Supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies). The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials ..." Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. <br />(8) AFMCFARS clause 5352.219-9001, "Use of Joint Ventures in Meeting the Limitations on Subcontracting Requirement (Nov 2007)" is planned for inclusion in any solicitation released for this effort. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this Sources Sought/ CRFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary" or "competition sensitive." Data submitted in response to this CRFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the government as it will be used to assist in developing an acquisition strategy. It is the responsibility of respondents to clearly mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings. Respondents are further advised that the government's analyses of your responses may require disclosure to Advisory and Assistance Services contractor personnel. All members of the evaluation team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All support contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government has also determined that the support contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The government's support contractors will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement concerning proprietary information prior to being granted access to your data. <br /><br />RESPONSES AND PAGE LIMITATIONS: Responses to this RFI must be received No Later Than 1500 (EST) 11 Feb 2013. Information packages may be submitted to Mrs. Brenda Maizel in an Adobe or MS Word compatible format by e-mail to brenda.maizel@wpafb.af.mil, or on a Windows compatible CD by mail to the following address: Attn: AFLCMC/LPAK, Attn: Brenda Maizel, 2145 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433-7017. Submissions shall not exceed 5 pages (8" X 11"). Font shall be 12-pitch with one-inch borders. Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights; however, if any information submitted is considered proprietary, then the pages containing such information must be marked accordingly.

Ensure that the submission provides the company name, address, a point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number, Federal CAGE Code, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This Request for Information (RFI) is not a Request for Quote, Request for Proposal, or other solicitation document. The Government is not seeking quotes, proposals, or bids and no contract, express or implied, shall result from this Request for Information. The Government will not reimburse any person, firm, corporation, or entity for costs incurred in responding to this Request for Information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This RFI seeks to survey sources available to fulfill the World Satellite Communications Service II requirement (WSCS II) for the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA). Details of the requirement are provided in the attached specification. Currently, the WSCS II services are provided via the WSCS I contract awarded to Americom Government Services (Contract number GS-35F-0328V, Order Number GST0112BK0015). The WSCS I contract expires on June 15, 2013. The WSCS II contract must be awarded prior to June 15, 2013. It is expected that the WSCS II contract will provide for up to a ten (10) year performance period Market Research conducted to date supports awarding a ten (10) year contract to Americom Government services to continue the Word Satellite Communication Services for NOAA and certain Department of Defense components on a non-competitive (sole-source) basis. <br /><br />Market Research supports a finding that contractors, other than Americom Government Services, would require a considerable period of time to establish the necessary network and other foundational requirements to complete contract requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Market research further supports a finding that the time and other resources necessary to complete contract requirements would exceed any potential cost savings to be realized via a competitive acquisition - even over the ten (10) year potential contract performance period. A competitive acquisition conducted on either a "Low Price Technically Acceptable" or "Best Value" basis would necessarily include price as an evaluation factor. The cost and price of the time and other resources necessary to complete contract requirements would likely cause the price of offers from Americom Government Services' competitors to be significantly higher than that the offer of Americom Government Services. Given the requirement is expressed as a specification, it is unlikely that any meaningful tradeoffs could be made between the price and technical components of an offer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This RFI requests sources to state their interest in participating in a competitive acquisition, notwithstanding the Government market research, by answering the questions which follow. Answers to the questions shall be provided to Anthony W. Pellegrino (<a href="mailto:anthony.pellegrino@gsa.gov">anthony.pellegrino@gsa.gov</a>) and Nate Cahoon (nate.cahoon@gsa.gov) not later than 5:00 p.m. (EST), January 31, 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Assuming a contract award of April 30, 2013, is your company capable of providing the services detailed in the attached specification (the "Specification") beginning June 16, 2013? If not, when would your company begin providing the services and what are the conditions precedent to providing the services? Stated another way, how much time is needed from the date of award of a contract until your company is able to provide the required services stated in the Specification?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. How will your company provide or undertake the necessary services detailed in the Specification at all required locations, most notably those at remote United States Military installations, to include Kaena Point, Hawaii and Thule Air Base, Greenland? Is your company able to provide or undertake the necessary services <em>without </em>regard to the locations detailed in the attached specification? If so, how would you complete the required services detailed in the Specification without regard to location?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. What real or personal property, if any, does your company require complete the services detailed in the Specification? Is any of that real or personal property currently owned by your company? If not, how long would it take your company to purchase of lease the necessary real or personal property (see paragraph a. above)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d. Does your company currently offer for sale or lease the services detailed in the Specification? If so, does it currently offer for sale or lease those services under an existing Governmentwide Acquisition Contract, i.e., a GWAC, the Federal Supply Schedules (sometimes called the Multiple Award Schedule) or another indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity type contract? If so, please state the name(s) and contract number(s) for any such contracts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please provide detailed responses but remember, this is a Request for Information and not a solicitation. No contract will be awarded from this RFI. If your company is interested in participating in a competitive acquisition, please respond by answering the foregoing questions in not more than ten (10) numbered pages using 1" margins, a 12-point font. Remember, a response is due to anthony.pellegrino@gsa.gov and <a href="mailto:nathan.cahoon@gsa.gov">nathan.cahoon@gsa.gov</a> not later than 5:00 p.m. (EST), January 31, 2013.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request For Information/Market Research Questionnaire (MRQ)  SNAP Retailer Integrity Project - Phase I
<SOLNBR>AG-3198-S-13-0007
<RESPDATE>020813
<CONTACT>David W. Lum, Contracting Officer/Team Lead, Phone 7033052991, Email David.Lum@fns.usda.gov
<DESC>The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is considering using a three-phase approach to identify and solicit qualified sources for an FNS Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) requirement - the SNAP Retailer Integrity Project. Please refer to the accompanying draft "Statement of Objectives" (SOO) for background and specific requirements regarding the subject matter. <br /><br />FNS is seeking leading industry sources capable of (1) performing the scale and scope of work as outlined within the accompanying Statement of Objectives (SOO) for the SNAP Retailer Integrity requirement and (2) participating in a market research study to demonstrate that they have a viable solution which could be used to establish the accuracy of prospective Offerors' proposed solutions using limited sample data that FNS may provide such Offerors. The qualified vendors shall be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement to comply with the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) guidelines, use the sample data FNS may provide such vendors and demonstrate the viability and accuracy of their proposed solutions. Such vendors will also be required to destroy all sample data FNS provides them once the market research study has been completed and a report has been submitted to FNS.<br /><br />
<p>FNS is establishing the subject SNAP Retailer Integrity Project that will consist of three phases. This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) as well as a Sources Sought Request (SSR) for Phase I of the SNAP Retailer Integrity Project. It is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute Request for Quotes/Proposals. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Additionally, the US Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Further, FNS offers no assurance that any solicitation will result from the information provided in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>Please note that the collection of this data does not obligate the US Government to incorporate the solicited comments nor does it obligate the Government to procure the services. Proprietary information should not be included in the RFI response. Responses to this RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p>FNS is expecting to solicit quotes for its SNAP Retailer Integrity requirements. The period of performance will be for a period still to be determined. A Firm Fixed Price contract type is anticipated. This will be a best value source selection using tradeoffs. A multi-phased approach in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202 Advisory Multi-Step Process may be conducted.</p>
<p>PURPOSE: The purpose of the subject RFI Notice is to solicit Phase I "Capability Statement" responses to the attached Market Research Questionnaire (MRQ) from interested sources. All sources are eligible to respond to this Notice. FNS shall evaluate all responses to the attached MRQ using the evaluation criteria below.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria for Phase I:<br /><br />1. The Capability Statement clearly describes a vendor's existing solution.<br />2. The Capability Statement lists all of the data elements that the proposed solution uses and describes how the data elements would be used to link the previously disqualified store owners to stores that are applying for SNAP, stores undergoing reauthorization, and all other stores currently SNAP authorized.<br />3. The Capability Statement lists all of the data elements that the proposed solution uses and describes how the data elements would be used to detect store owners who have certain criminal convictions, committed fraud, violated certain laws, or have shown a lack of business integrity in other government programs and who are applying for SNAP, undergoing reauthorization, and all other stores currently SNAP authorized.<br />4. The Capability Statement shows that the use of the proposed solution has in the past projects proved to be accurate resulting in "zero" or "near-zero" false positives.</p>
<p>FNS will use prospective Offerors' response to the MRQ to determine their viability for Phase II of the study. The response to the MRQ should also include a nominal price, at or below the micro-purchase threshold, for participating in Phase II of the study and demonstrating the viability of the proposed solution(s) using the sample data for approximately 200 retailers selected by FNS. The sample data will consist of a mixture of both previously disqualified retailers as well as eligible retailers that have no record reported to FNS of criminal convictions or finding of administrative fraud in a Government program. FNS is seeking for one solution that will address all requirements listed in the Executive Summary of the Statement of Objectives, but will accept two separate solutions for the requirements. FNS shall evaluate the viability of the proposed solution(s) using the evaluation criteria below.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria for Phase II:<br />1. If one (1) solution is proposed that will address all requirements:<br />a. The solution will be able to seek out and identify all previously disqualified owners in the sample data who have misrepresented their identity or have an undisclosed relationship to a new owner.<br />b. The solution will be able to seek out and identify all owners in the sample data who have certain criminal convictions, committed fraud, violated certain laws, or shown a lack of business integrity in other government programs.</p>
<p>2. If two (2) solutions are proposed that will address each requirement individually:<br />a. The first solution will be able to seek out and identify all previously disqualified owners in the sample data who have misrepresented their identity or have an undisclosed relationship to a new owner.<br />b. The second solution will be able to seek out and identify all owners in the sample data who have certain criminal convictions, committed fraud, violated certain laws, or shown a lack of business integrity in other government programs.</p>
<p>Payment under Phase II, system demonstrations, is deemed to be an allowable expense under FAR 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs, for applied research to improve technology. The Agency will use the results of system assessments to make an informed decision on viability of a solution and whether or not it is feasible to release a solicitation. However, the Agency will only pay to the selected firms a nominal amount, less than the micro-purchase threshold, and as agreed to by both parties, allowable costs to demo the system.</p>
<p>These costs shall be broken down in the firm's Phase I response. The Agency intends to pay the selected vendors via Visa card or purchase order for the system demonstration and documented results.</p>
<p>The purpose of conducting the market research is to gain an understanding of the capabilities and qualifications that exist in the current marketplace as well as to formulate a performance-based acquisition strategy. The Government intends to use such information gathered as part of the competitive process to identify the most viable sources for the follow-on, Phase II of the competition. However, if FNS concludes that no viable solutions exist, it may not pursue Phases II and III of the competition.</p>
<p>Respondents will be classified as being "Viable" or "Non-viable" using their Capability Statement and above evaluation criteria. A maximum of 3-5 most-highly rated viable respondents will be invited to participate in the resultant Phase II of the competition. Based on assessment of Phase II results and acquisition strategy decision, firms participating in Phase II will again be formally notified if they are deemed viable or non-viable, and viable firms may be invited to participate in Phase III of the competition for the full-scale solution implementation. However, respondents who have not been considered as viable competitors, notwithstanding the evaluations of Phases I and II, may request to participate in the resultant competitive acquisition of Phase III along with other vendors based on the final acquisition strategy decision.</p>
<p>Your firm is hereby invited to complete the information requested on the attached questionnaire. Please note that your response shall be limited to 10 pages, including past performance descriptions and all attachments, but excluding a cover page and a table of contents. The formatting should utilize 1" margins and a font size no smaller than or equal to 12 pitch.</p>
<p>The required due date for submission of the completed information package is no later than: 5:00 PM EST, Friday, February 08, 2013 submitted via e-mail to: David.Lum@fns.usda.gov</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for an ongoing program - the NHLBI ARDS Clinical Trials Network (ARDSNet). The ARDSNet is a collection of 12 Clinical Centers (CCs) and one CCC that conducts definitive clinical trials that can improve the outcomes of patients with ARDS. The CCs are completing enrollment in their fourth and final protocol: Statins for Acutely Injured Lungs with Sepsis (SAILS). This study will test the efficacy of rosuvastatin in resolving Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in patients with ALI/ARDS from an infectious etiology. The NHBLI anticipates that the CCC will be needed until October 2013 to achieve recruitment goals of the trial.</p>
<p>The ARDSNet is governed by a steering committee (SC) composed of principal investigators from the CCs and the CCC along with the NHLBI Contracting Officer's Representative. The SC selects, designs, and recruits patients into the protocols. The CCC oversees all aspects of network governance and conduct: it manages all committees, maintains public and private websites, provides all needed statistical expertise for design and analysis of studies, provides all support needed to conduct studies including preparation of case report forms, training of all clinical staff, daily assistance with protocols, and safety oversight. NHLBI has a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for advice on study continuation in accordance with decision guidelines that are a part of the clinical trial protocol. The CCC coordinates all SC activities and prepares all reports for the DSMB including communications about safety and planned interim analyses. The CCC prepares all final data reports and plays a major role in the preparation of manuscripts for peer reviewed journals</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division (NSWC, IHD).  The purpose of this Sources Sought is to seek the availability and capability of qualified contractors that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein:
The Joint Staff (TJS) is currently the program manager of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) capability known as the Enterprise Business Accountability System (EBAS).  The EBAS Program Manager requires contractor support for EBAS.  The EBAS PM provides cross services to select DoD Agencies as a Shared Service Provider (SSP) for Momentum.
  The solution consists of three integrated financial and budget systems: Comptroller Automated Budget System (CABS), the Programming Budget System (PBS), and the Exhibit Automation System (EAS). CABS and PBS are implementations of CGIs Momentum Financials and Momentum Performance Budgeting (PB), respectively.  EAS is a Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) solution. Additional EBAS tools include:  eAcquisition or eACQ (a procurement requirements, funding, and approval workflow), eORF (a workflow supporting spending and approvals of Official Representation Funds), and eTraining or eTRAIN (a workflow supporting the approvals and SF 182 forms required for requesting and funding, training).  These additional EBAS tools are built in webMethods, and support generation of forms, digital signatures, and back-end financial updates and funds control directly in the CABS application.
  The suite of integrated tools and systems, its interfaces, automated workflows applications, and COGNOS reporting capability collectively allow EBAS to automate DoD Agencies business processes.  EBAS represents an end-to-end Program, Budget, Execution, Accounting, and Reporting solution, automating and integrating processes from formulation and justification through execution.

In this capacity, the EBAS performs the following high level functions with contractor support. 
	Program Management Support  including, but not limited to, to providing oversight to DoD agencies that are migrating their current business process environments to the EBAS (Momentum) infrastructure.  This includes providing business process integration, implementation planning, workforce preparation, data conversion, and help desk services.
	Customer Implementation  providing full system integration deployment of customers in the EBAS Momentum and Business Intelligence, FinMart, based solutions.
  This includes full lifecycle implementation support including: project management, requirements, design, configuration, system integration, and test, delivery and acceptance, and maintenance.

This is a sources sought notice for the identification of potential small business vendors who have the capacity to provide total parenteral nutrition (TPN) intravenous feeding method indicated for those patients who require complete bowel rest or fail to obtain nourishment from a dysfunctional gastrointestinal tract.   The full daily caloric requirement can be met with parenteral delivery of macronutrients (carbohydrates, amino acids, and fats), as well as the replacement of micronutrients (electrolytes, minerals, vitamins, and other additives), tailored to the individual patient.  The majority of calories are supplied with carbohydrates, followed by lipids, then amino acids.  TPN solutions at are prepared by a technician and a pharmacist using aseptic technique in an ISO Class 7 sterile room in an ISO Class 5 Laminar Flow Hood to ensure sterility.  The pharmacy staff uses a Baxter compounding machine to custom prepare the macronutrient base of the TPNs.  Then the electrolytes, minerals, and other additives are individually and manually drawn up into syringes and injected into the TPN base.  There are several series of double and triple checks throughout this process to ensure the complex TPN solution is formulated correctly.  Currently, Bay Pines dictates a standard hang time of 1800 for all TPN solution bags; to meet this hang time, all orders should be submitted by 1300.  Preparation and delivery of TPN must meet VHA, FDA and JCAHO admixture standards.  A total of approximately seven (7) TPN will be delivered daily, three hundred and sixty-five (365) days a year to 10,000 Bay Pines Blvd., Bay Pines, FL  33744.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center, Altoona, Pennsylvania will be holding a vendor conference to discuss VA's upcoming requirement for the establishment and operation of a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Huntingdon County.  All interested Contractors and Subcontractors are invited to attend this event to discuss VA's basic requirement for services.
The draft versions of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) have been attached to this notice for conference preparation purposes.  These are not the final versions of either the PWS or QASP, but are anticipated to be very close representations of the final documents which will be released as part of the final solicitation package.  The PWS and QASP are being provided so that Contractors and Subcontractors can review the documents and provide feedback to VA on the feasibility of the requirement, cost drivers, and missing or unclear elements of the requirement.  The Altoona VAMC's requirement may include primary care, laboratory, radiology, psychiatry, podiatry, optometry, and audiology services.
Contractors and Subcontractors are invited to provide comments and submit questions regarding the PWS and QASP in writing to the Contract Specialist listed below by January 18, 2013 for discussion at the vendor conference.  Written questions will also be accepted on the day of the vendor conference from participants however, those questions will be answered after the conference with the questions and responses posted to FBO.  All questions and responses will be posted to FBO.  Any information submitted by attendees that is proprietary or sensitive in nature should be clearly marked as such and should include a statement that the information should not be released by the Government.
The Vendor Conference will be held on Thursday, January 24, 2013 from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. in the Ballroom located in the Huntingdon County Offices at 233 Penn Street, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.  
All questions regarding the PWS, QASP, or Vendor Conference should be submitted in writing to Caroline L. Robinette via email to Caroline.Robinette@va.gov or fax to 814-940-7850.  Ms. Robinette can be reached by phone at 814-943-8164, extension 7232, however, no questions regarding the PWS or QASP will be answered verbally.
The type of work required may include, but is not limited to any of the disciplines listed in sector 62 of the Small Business Administration Table of Small Business Size Standards for medical services.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 621498 (All Other Outpatient Care Centers) and the size standard is $10.0 million.  The corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) is 8011, classification code:  Q201.
After award of the contract the successful offeror will be required to implement their total solution to open and operate a brand new CBOC in a county where there is currently no VA presence.  The preferred area for the CBOC will be along the State Route 22 Corridor to include the communities of Huntingdon and Mount Union.  Other areas within the county will be considered.  The Contractor will be required to recruit and retain staff from appropriate disciplines to ensure that services offered at the other CBOCs operated by the Altoona VAMC are offered at the Contractor's CBOC.  The Contractor will be responsible for ensuring that all patients are seen timely per VA's scheduling standards without jeopardizing patient safety.

<DESC>The Mission Contracting Office, Fort Hood, Texas intends to  award a firm fixed price sole-source contract to American Water (AW) for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the Fort Hood Family Housing (FHFH) owned water distribution and wastewater collection system (known herein as  quote mark infrastructure quote mark ) on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented  by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   The Government intends to enter into a firm fixed price requirements with American Water Operations and Maintenance Inc., 1025 Laurel Oak Road, Voorhees, NJ 08043-3506 for a period of 6 months from 1 February 2013 through 31 July 2013.  The justification for this noncompetitive solicitation is due to a portion of the infrastructure on the installation is currently owned by a third party, the Fort Hood Family Housing known as the Residential Communities Initiative partnership (RCI). If a contract is awarded to a party other than AW, there will be significant concerns associated with having two different utility providers operating the same utility system. The NAICS code for this procurement is 221320 Sewage Treatment Facilities with a size standard of $7.0M.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no solicitation will be issued.   Initiating a separate competitive action for a 6-month bridge contract would not outweigh the benefits to the Government. Time does not permit a phase-in period, therefore, there is not a reasonable expectation a new contractor will successfully perform without critical delays and/or interruption of service. All responses must be provided no later than 10:00 am CST 24 January 2013. Questions should be directed to Camille Dye via email at camille.dye.civ@mail.mil and SSG Joshua Ruffner at Joshua.e.ruffner.mil@mail.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Perry Point Medical Center, has a requirement to perform electrical design to upgrade/improve the Dietetics Kitchen in Building 17H. The design will consist of plans to install an emergency generator at Building 17H and re-routing existing duct banks. As stated in the description of services to be performed, the A/E firm will design an alternate electrical feed system from a newly installed concrete manhole vault, underground to the exterior wall of Building 17H, then exposed along the wall to tie in the existing switchgear inside the basement level. The systems will connect to, and become part of the electrical systems designed by EBL Engineers, LLC in the original design project. It is the Governments belief that only EBL Engineers, LLC possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement within the time constraints. EBL Engineers, LLC previously held the A&E portion (V512(P)P-977) of contract number VA245-C-0307 project number 512-07-309 titled FCA Upgrade/Improve Dietetics Kitchen Project. The previous contract as designed by EBL Engineers, LLC was halted due to unforeseen site conditions and as time passed funding for all A&E design work expired on the previous contract. To keep all design plans consistent and hold the continuity of all construction completed to this point on construction project 512-07-309, the Department of Veteran Affairs, VA Perry Point Medical Center intends to award a Firm-Fixed price A&E contract to EBL Engineers, LLC for the redesign of the electrical portion of Building 17H Dietetics Kitchen pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. It is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source. Per FAR 6.302-1, "all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency". Inquiries to this notice shall be submitted no later than 15 calendar days of the posting of this notice. Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered. The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned. The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited. As required by FAR 6.305 Availability of the Justification, the sole source justification as approved shall be made publicly available within 14 days after contract award.

<CONTACT>Ronald Mazzei

<a href="mailto:ronald.mazzei@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis with 
Working Walls, Inc., 100 Hayes Dr. Suite B, Cleveland, OH, to purchase their Acoustical Panels, for the following reasons: 

The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System needs to purchase Acoustical Panels made by Working Walls, Inc, since they possess the following unique features that are not available in any other manufacturer's similar product:

Acoustical Panels that are made by other manufacturers help absorb sound reflected off the walls in a room making that room less reverberant or "echo-ey."  While they help to make the specific room they are in quieter, they do nothing to keep sound from escaping through the panel, through the wall behind it and out of the room, disturbing people outside the room.  

The Acoustical Panels made by Working Walls, Inc. not only have sound absorptive like above, which is essential to the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, but their acoustic panels are also made with a "double modification" process that adds an additional layer of material to the back of each panel that acts as a barrier to keep much of the sound from penetrating the panel and escaping the room, which is also essential to the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, since they are going in an audiology area where testing and other measurements are taken, and it is especially critical not only for each room to be quiet, but the sound from one room should not be escaping and interfering with the work done in other rooms, and the double modification process in the Working Walls, Inc. acoustic panels is necessary to prevent this, and since no other manufacturer makes acoustical panels with this additional needed feature.

Working Walls will perform acoustical calculations and design and install acoustical panels per the calculations to minimize reverberation and other acoustical problems in the ACC.		

It is also essential to purchase the above mentioned acoustical panels made by Working Walls, Inc., off the GSA Federal Supply Schedule, on a Sole Source basis, since they are the sole exclusive seller and installer, of their acoustical panels, on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule. (GSA Contract No. GS-28F-7062G). 

In addition, it is essential to purchase the above mentioned Working Walls, Inc. Acoustical Panels,  from Working Wallls, Inc., and have them install them as well, using their local authorized dealer/installer Burke and Michael, since Working Walls, is the sole exclusive seller and installer of their Acoustical Panels, and Burke and Michael is their authorized delivery and installation subcontractor, and since it is essential that the company performing the delivery and installation are located locally within the Pittsburgh, PA area, and since this requirement represents the minimum need of the government and requires a turnkey job.  

This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest; accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than 01/14/2013 COB. Responses should be sent to ronald.mazzei@va.gov. No telephone responses will be accepted. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The NAICS Code for this item is 337214, and the small business size standard for this NAICS Code is 500 Employees.

ATLS has become the foundation of care for injured patients by teaching a common language and a common approach. The 8th edition was created using an international, multidisciplinary, and evidence-based approach. The result is an ATLS that is contemporary and meaningful in the global community. <br> One of the tragedies that demonstrated the pressing need of a trauma management procedure such as ATLS took place in February, 1976.  Dr. Jim Styner, an orthopedic surgeon, crashed his small plane into a cornfield in rural Nebraska. Dr. Styner and three of his children sustained serious injuries. His wife was killed instantly and one child sustained minor injuries. The care that he and his family subsequently received was based on the standards used then and proved to be completely inadequate. The surgeon, recognizing how insufficient their treatment was, stated,  quote mark ...when I can provide better care in the field with limited resources than what my children and I received at the primary care facility, there is something wrong with the system, and the system has to be changed. quote mark  This disaster led to make changes to the practice followed in the first hour of trauma care for injured patients in the United States and in the rest of the world.  <br> The US DoD has become increasingly aware of the fact that Honduras is a highly disaster prone and vulnerable country with no standardized system to take care of trauma victims. After an initial assessment of the area's statistics, resources, needs and deficiencies it was clear that a true trauma system was lacking as well as major shortcomings in the medical community for handling trauma victims. Aside from the natural disasters the crime-related organizations, transnational and local gangs and other criminal groups have reached alarming and unprecedented levels which significantly worsen security and make this sub region one of the most violent areas in the world. These circumstances are posing a serious threat to human security, affect everyday life in the region and generate a large number of trauma related injuries.  <br> The intent of this project is to establish as self sustaining system recognized by the American College of Surgeons to implement a mandatory ATLS course for all providers working in Honduras Emergency rooms to adequately handle trauma victims in the whole country. It is obvious that a response program should be developed and enforced immediately. <br> Note: Advanced Trauma Life Support  and ATLS  are proprietary trademarks and service marks owned by the American College of Surgeons and cannot be used by individuals or entities outside the ACS COT organization for their goods and services without ACS approval. The ACS is a not-for-profit organization with great credibility all over the world and has become the  quote mark Gold Standard quote mark  for trauma management all over the world. <br>  <br>  <br> 1.2 SCOPE: MEDEL requires two ACS validated ATLS  courses for Honduran Surgical Association Trauma Committee, to train a total of 32 (thirty-two) Honduran Providers and complete the validation of the 6 (six) instructors that received initial course in Costa Rica in October 2011, plus 8 (eight) more during the second course. These courses must follow all ACS/ATLS  standards where the emphasis is driven towards rapid initial assessment and primary treatment of injured patients, starting at the time of injury and continuing through initial assessment, lifesaving intervention, reevaluation, stabilization, and, when needed, transfer to a trauma center. The courses must each include a pre-course and post-course tests, core content lectures, interactive case presentations, discussions, development of lifesaving skills, practical laboratory experiences, and a final performance proficiency evaluation. Upon completion of the courses, participants who received the training should feel confident in implementing the skills taught in the ATLS  course. Guarantee that a sustainable ATLS  training site is created in country with all required training equipment provided by the contractor and at least 14 ACS certified instructors are recognized by the ACS/ATLS  board of directors. <br>  <br> 1.3. Once initial course is completed where sixteen participants have been trained a cadre of at least six new instructors must be identified to start the replication effect of this effort in the country. <br>  <br> 1.4. Sustainability: Within the remaining year of the contract, the second and last DoD sponsored validated ATLS course for Honduran Surgical Association Trauma Committee must be completed to train sixteen more participants and validate eight more instructors in order to leave in place an ACS recognized, self sustaining, ATLS training center in country that will be responsible of training the future providers working in Emergency Rooms nationwide. As part of this effort the contractor must purchase and leave with the Honduran Trauma Committee the necessary audiovisual, books, equipment and mannequins necessary to guarantee the project is self sustainable. <br>  <br> 1.5.

Pediatric population requires appropriate planning to ensure that children receive the necessary care during disasters.  Children are not simply small adults; due to their size, physiology, and cognitive development, they have a unique set of responses upon exposure to the infectious organisms associated with public health epidemics or the chemical, radiological, and biological agents of terrorist attacks.  They also have certain psychological vulnerabilities that require special attention.   <br>  	The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), an organization of 55,000 pediatricians from over 60 countries worldwide, dedicated to the well-being of children. Founded in 1996 the American Academy of Pediatrics' Section on International Child Health (SOICH). This section was created by a core group of dedicated pediatricians with decades of collective field experience, that now has nearly a thousand members working together to actively enhance the health and well-being of children globally - particularly those living in low resource settings.   Thanks to these efforts the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP now has an ongoing mechanism to implement disaster preparedness initiatives, respond to requests for pediatric expertise on disaster readiness, and integrate these activities. <br>  	The intent of this project is to establish as self sustaining system recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics that helps the Honduran Pediatric Association set up a program to train pediatricians, first responders and health workers nationwide on adequate management of pediatric population during disasters.  <br>  <br>  <br> 1.2 SCOPE: MEDEL requires two American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) validated Pediatric Disaster Courses   be taught to the Honduran Pediatric Association, Red Cross, COPECO (FEMA equivalent) Firefighters/other first responders, to train a total of 60 (sixty) Honduran Providers and first responders on how to adequately manage Pediatric patients in Disaster situations.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(g) (1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database;<br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g) (1) (i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g) (1) (i) (C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.<br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC>This procurement is for the design and construction of all associated infrastructure and utilities for RM 11-12803 and RM 10-10044 Energy Efficiency Special Projects at NBK Bremerton, WA and is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition. This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases. 

Source Selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a firm-fixed price construction contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.
 Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone Small Business concerns, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for the design and construction, including the restoration and modernization of up to 15 buildings, which will occur by replacing existing inefficient and/or non-functioning building systems with fully functioning high efficiency building systems.  The purpose of the project is to fulfill the requirements of Energy Independence & Security Act (EISA) 2007 to implement energy and water conservation measures in the two buildings located within the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility at Naval Base Kitsap.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA Beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following: Admission identification record; VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care or State-approved referral form; Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician; Physician orders; Progress notes; the physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen; special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.; SMA Patient Assessment Form (only if SMA level of care is used); and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information, provided to VA upon admission and every six months thereafter.
15.  The beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the nursing care and treatment plan received from VA unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for fifteen (15) calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing home's Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patient's stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.  The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VA's request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements - All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.
18.  The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site inspection of the Nursing Home by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.  It is agreed that the Nursing Home shall provide VA with copies of all state agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA's quality improvement-quality assurance program functions relating to this agreement, including VA's on-site inspection and monitoring.   The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the contractor's reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.

VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one day, (4) LIFE SAFETY CODE CLAUSE:  The administrator of your facility is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer at least 3 days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility, which were in existence at the time this contract was issued.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Fire Safety Officer responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of your facility and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval/disapproval of your facility to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes. Examples of facility change (but not limited to) that require VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows; interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen/trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls/doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems, (5) If the veteran had a former VA primary care physician, VA policy precludes this provider being available to the veteran during the period of nursing home care.  The assigned nursing home physician is the primary doctor during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the community nursing home.  The community nursing home physician is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Physician visits will be according to medical assistance guidelines.  The assigned nursing home physician will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care, easy access to staff for consultation, provide timely response to calls and arrange for timely physician back-up according to OBRA guidelines (Ref. 42 CFR 483.40 OBRA Guidelines), (6) In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident; advance directives/living wills shall be considered according to nursing home doctor's orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian, or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VAMC is contacted by the private hospital physician within 72 hours of admission.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care, (7) VA MEDICAL CENTER CONSULTATION/RESOURCES: (a)  Telephone Care Communications System (TCCS):  For urgent-same day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 605-336-3230 x6181 between 9AM and 3PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same day appointment is anticipated, please call as early as possible, (b) Admissions System phone number 605-336-3230.  For non-emergency consultation/evaluation for admission to the VA Medical Center (after initial evaluation/intervention by the nursing home physician), (8) Ancillary Services/Supplies:  Any additional cost to the all-inclusive contract must be preapproved according to the following terms: (a) Medications/supplies will be billed/paid according to generic average wholesale pricing guidelines; monthly invoices verifying cost must be submitted for payment of any additional approved rates. Discharge Medications - on the day of discharge, the facility will dispense medications for a 14 day supply to the veteran and facility can bill to the VA at the AWP, and  (b)  Billing:  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) will not be billed for uncovered services/costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.  Reimbursement for all bed holds will be 70% of the prevailing per diem rate.  After a patient absence of fifteen (15) consecutive days the patient authorization for VA contract care ends, and (10) The contract nursing home will assume responsibility for arranging dental care at the veteran's/families' expense.

<p>The Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NSWDG) has a requirement to procure the following:</p>
<p>Section B Schedule of Supplies and Services</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 MOUT/Tracker Camera Upgrade and Repair (See Section C - Statement of Work)<br />QTY: 1 Lump Sum</p>
<p>Section C - Statement of Work</p>
<p>SOW PART A-GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>A.1 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This requirement is for the upgrade and repair of 109 B.E. Meyers MOUT/Tracker camera assemblies.</p>
<p>A.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Government's facility contains 109 MOUT/Tracker Cameras manufactured by B.E. Meyers. The cameras contain a daytime color camera and a no light black and white camera that utilizes an infrared illuminator. The camera assembly detects light levels and automatically energizes the IR illuminator and the night time camera when light levels are reduced. The illuminators installed in the cameras are set to a bandwidth that is not visible with MIL SPEC night vision goggles. The cameras were installed in 2006 and are in need of a circuit board upgrade and miscellaneous repairs to extend their life cycle.</p>
<p>A.3 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to purchase, design, fabricate, install, and test a circuit board upgrade in 109 B.E. Meyers MOUT/Tracker cameras. Evaluate IR illuminator output. Evaluate cameras for other needed repairs and complete authorized repairs.</p>
<p>SOW PART B-WORK REQUIREMENTS</p>

<p>B.1.1 The Government shall ship the cameras to the contractor in increments of 20. The final increment may be less than 20.</p>
<p>B.1.2 The contractor shall evaluate the camera to determine if it is cost feasible to upgrade the main control board. If a camera has repairs (excluding the control board upgrade) totaling more than 33% of the cost for a new camera, the contractor shall not install a main control board and deem the camera as "not repairable". The Government considers the 33% threshold to be $1400.00.</p>
<p>B.1.3 Any diagnostic fee charged by the contractor shall be applied to camera upgrades and repairs. If the camera was deemed non-repairable the contractor shall be entitled to a predetermined fee for diagnostics.</p>
<p>B.1.4 The contractor shall purchase, design, fabricate, install, and test an upgraded main control board in 110 MOUT/Tracker cameras, or a quantity equal to those deemed "repairable" in item B.1.2. The upgraded board shall incorporate a heat sink on the main board and correct deficiencies identified in the original design. The circuit board shall be compatible with other components in the camera and not affect its normal operating parameters.</p>
<p>B.1.5 If the contractor fails to identify repairs that exceed the 33% threshold prior to installing the main control board the contractor shall complete those repairs at its own expense.</p>
<p>B.1.6 The contractor shall ship cameras to the Government upon completion of the main control board upgrade, unless other repairs are pending. Cameras deemed non-repairable can be utilized for parts to repair other cameras. The contractor shall not invoice for parts removed from non-repairable cameras. All non-repairable cameras/parts shall be returned to the Government upon the completion of the upgrade and repair of all cameras.</p>
<p>B.2 CAMERA REPAIRS</p>
<p>B.2.1 The contractor shall provide a written report via email, in PDF format, itemizing the repairs for each group of twenty cameras. Report shall identify cameras by serial number.</p>
<p>B.2.2 The report shall include power output of the IR illuminator by camera serial number.</p>
<p>B.2.3 Upon authorization by DESIGNATED Government personnel, the contractor shall repair specified cameras. The Government intends to complete all repairs that do not exceed 33% of the replacement cost for a new camera.</p>
<p>B.2.4 If the contractor initiates repairs and then discovers repairs it failed to identify in the report, which cause the 33% threshold to be exceeded, the contractor shall complete those repairs at its own expense.</p>
<p>B.2.5 Upon completion of repairs for each increment of 20 the contractor shall ship cameras to the Government.</p>
<p>B.2.6 The Government will continue to ship cameras in increments of 20 as it receives repaired units back from the contractor.</p>
<p>B.2.7 The contractor shall ship all non-repairable cameras and parts to the Government upon completion of camera upgrades and repairs.</p>
<p>B.3 CAMERA UPGRADE AND REPAIR</p>
<p>B.3.1 The MOUT/Tracker Camera is designed and manufactured by B.E. Meyers and contains proprietary design features. The contractor completing repairs and upgrades shall not modify the camera housing or dimensions. The contractor shall be an authorized B.E. Meyers service provider. Installed parts must return the cameras to within their original operating specifications and capabilities. Any illuminators replaced shall not emit a bandwidth visible with MIL SPEC night vision goggles.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

12. Description:
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-R-200008 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-62.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees.  The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price contract for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:  
SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET FOR REQUIREMENTS
It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  
Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  
Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 
The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:

Cost or Pricing Data
It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition.  However, in the event only one responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.

Evaluation  Commercial Items 
Proposals will be evaluated and contract issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  
Technically Acceptable:  Proposals must be for new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- <br />(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; <br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- <br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or <br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and <br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. <br />Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs <br />(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. <br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: <br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or <br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). <br />(2) Plan deemed in certain cases.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

12. Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200026 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft.  THE SCHEDULE OF LINE ITEMS IS ON A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT.
  




It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  

Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:

Cost or Pricing Data

However, in the event only one responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.


Evaluation  Commercial Items 
Quotes will be evaluated and purchase order issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable. 
Technically Acceptable:  Quotes must be for new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--  <br>  (1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;   <br>  (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and  <br>  (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and  <br>  (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.  <br>  (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:  <br>  (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.  <br>  (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.  <br>  (ii) Examples.  <br>  (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.  <br>  (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.  <br>  (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.  <br>  (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C.  362 (the Bankruptcy Code).  <br>  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]  <br>  (1) Listed End Product  <br>  Listed End Product:	Listed Countries of Origin:  <br>    	    <br>    	    <br>    	    <br>  (2) Certification.

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-  <br>  (1) [_] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or   <br>  (2) [_] Outside the United States.  <br>  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]  <br>  (1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to attach the revised pricing spreadsheet and extend the closing date.<br /><br />The original pricing spreadsheet was causing some issues due to the column widths not being wide enough.&nbsp; The attached revised spreadsheet fixes this problem and has the correct part # for item 31.<br /><br />The closing date has been extended to 7 November.<br /><br />Clarify engine serial numbers- a vendor had asked for the serial numbers of the USCG RB-M engines to more accurately provide pricing for the requested parts.&nbsp; The serial numbers provided with the 26 October amendment are the serial numbers of the last 2 engines the USCG has received from the engine builder.&nbsp; Sorry for any confusion this has caused.<br /><br />The USCG is actively working with the OEM to clarify the issue with incorrect/changed part numbers.&nbsp; We anticipate receiving this information shortly and updating vendors via solicitation amendment which will clarify any part number issues.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to revise the pricing spreadsheet and to extend the closing date to Nov 13th.<br /><br />The pricing spreadsheet has some revised/updated part numbers, highlighted in green for identification.&nbsp; The items highlighted in blue are new line items that require pricing.&nbsp; They are added to the spreadsheet to provide the USCG additional flexibility when ordering off of the resulting IDIQ contract.&nbsp; This is because occasionally, especially early in the contract performance, a part will be required that is a&nbsp;remanufactured part, and the USCG requires that part new, or there will be a part requiring a core turn in, but the USCG doesn't have a core to turn in.

<DESC>The purpose of the Amendment is to change the proposed effort will begin on 1 Oct 2013 and continue through 30 Sep 2018 (Basic with four priced one-year options).&nbsp; The US Air Force Defense Support Program (DSP) intends to issue a follow-on contract to the current DSP On-orbit Support and Sustainment Contract (DOSSC) to provide factory and operations site(s) support and sustainment to the on-orbit DSP satellite constellation. The new contract, DSP Sustainment Contract (DSC) is currently envisioned by the government to be awarded as a single contract. It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released in the 2nd quarter of FY13 with a period of performance beginning in FY 14 with one basic year and four (4) one-year options. Contract award is projected for the 4th quarter of FY13. The DSP mission uses highly technical non-imaging infrared and other sensors to detect ballistic missile launches, space launches, endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric nuclear detonations, and reports them to US and allied forces and assets deployed worldwide through the Integrated Tactical Warning and Assessment (ITWAA) configuration control processes. The DSC will require the following support: (1) Technical support to operational missile warning on-orbit constellation satellites, trending analysis, performance and data archive, as well as the training of new personnel; (2) Spaced based non-imaging infrared mission performance assessment for real-time mission support and infrared event data analysis; (3) Operational satellite and payload anomaly support to include root cause determination and implementation of corrective actions; (4) Contractor facilities supporting on-orbit operations (either from the factory or at the ops site) must be Defense Security Service (DSS) certified and capable of processing classified information as required by the DSP constellation. The contractor retains responsibility for recapitalization and/or replacement of any hardware/equipment obsolescence throughout the duration of the contract; (5) Program support includes management of contractor team and contract/business operations segment to track financial issues and deliverables; (6) Capability to develop software tools and implement command plans; and (7) Support at various government sites. In addition, the government may seek to continue efforts currently on the DOSSC as follows: (1) rapid prototyping of data processing enhancements that maximize the utility of DSP data and maintain mission capability of aging assets; and (2) mission processor initiatives. Interested parties must possess knowledgeable, capable, and experienced individuals with the proper security clearances who can provide real time assistance/guidance to government satellite operators at the Mission Control Station and any backup site supporting operations.
<p>Vendors are invited to participate if a comparable level of performance is available. Interested parties who believe they have the capability to perform as a prime contractor in support of this effort must submit a Statement of Technical Capabilities (SOC), which includes the following information: Personnel/Size Standard, Company Name, Mailing Address, Point of Contact and Telephone Numbers, Business Size Classification, Large, Small or Other, and experience-specific work previously performed relevant to this follow-on effort. Small Business companies with the capability to perform this requirement as a prime contractor are encouraged to participate. The small business size standard for this requirement is NAICS 541712, with Note #11 (Size Standard 1,000 employees). If you are interested only in subcontracting opportunities please indicate clearly in your submission. The Statement of Capabilities (SOC) must conform to 8.5 X 11-inch pages, with one-inch margins and font no smaller than 12-point, shall not exceed twenty pages and must be submitted by January 22, 2013 4:00pm Pacific Standard Time. Submit an electronic copy of the SOC to Kimberly Johnson at Kimberly.calvert-johnson@us.af.mil, and mail one hard copy via U.S. Postal Service addressed to: SMC/ISK, ATTN: Cathy Butler, Contracting Officer, Space and Missile System Center (SMC), 483 N. Aviation Blvd, BLDG 271, El Segundo, California 90245-2808. The government will use the SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources to develop its acquisition strategy. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The Government will not pay any cost associated with the submittal of information solicited herein. The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such. Verbal responses will not be accepted.</p>

At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida intends to issue a sole source firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to QinetiQ, Inc. (the U.S. branch of QinetiQ, Ltd.), 1215 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 1102, Arlington, VA 22202-4344 for the purchase of up to five (5) new Advanced Reconnaissance System (ARS) Electro-Optic (EO) Sensors (part number 10010319) to include repair of the sensors that are or will be deployed to the fleet. The contract period of performance will be five years and will provide for firm fixed price delivery orders.  

This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: The ARS Electro-Optic sensors, along with its interface to the system it is installed on are based upon proprietary information developed by QinetiQ.
 Sole proprietorship restrictions are specific to the problem of producing an image sensor that meets the required environmental and size constraints imposed by the system integration. As the sole developer and original equipment manufacturer (OEM), QinetiQ Inc. is the only source with sufficient in-depth knowledge of the EO sensor that could fabricate the parts, conduct repairs and deliver on schedule.  Currently, no other source meets the form, fit, and function requirements for the ARS Electro-Optic Sensor.  Alternative known Sensors would require development and extensive engineering and environmental testing efforts, which would not meet the known deliverable dates for procurement.  

Delivery will be made to the Receiving Officer, Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City FL 32407.
  Delivery will be made to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. 

Interested Offerors may submit request(s) for qualification on future requirements via e-mail to Contract Specialist  Tim Reed at tim.e.reed1@navy.mil by 22 January 2013.  Requests must be marked with the synopsis designation number and should include the offerors name, address, telephone number, commercial and government entity (CAGE) code, point of contact, and clearly identify the offerors capabilities.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 660-14-103 - Elevator Refurbishment at the George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center (VAMC), Salt Lake City, Utah.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. 

The Salt Lake City VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to provide all A/E services for correcting elevator deficiencies in the patient care building.  The deficiencies that will be corrected include: addition of voice annunciation as required for ADA compliance, elevator controller, machine, door and fixture equipment replacement, and upgrades to drive train.  

The AE firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired construction work.  Microsoft Project scheduling and management software will be used by both the A&E and Contractors to allow for regular tracking of schedules and work by the VAMC.   Schedules with MS Project will be regularly sent to the COR upon project initiation and whenever significant changes occur in the schedule.   All work must be designed within a construction cost range of $500,000 to $1,000,000.  The AE will provide an initial estimate of cost to perform the above work and will design only those items that can be provided within the cost limitation. Submission requirements are the initial estimate and preliminary design submission, a 50% design submission, and a 95% design submission.  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the AE to minimize impact of the construction.  The AE will provide documents at each submission as indicated in the statement of work.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do, type in 330 in the "Find A Form" block and click on search. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. Interested firms should submit one (1) copy of their current SF 330 no later than 12:00 PM Mountain Standard Time (MST) January 28, 2013 to andrew.stigen@va.gov. The emailed file shall not exceed 5MB in total.

(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;
(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials;
(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;
(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;
(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and
(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
(7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.
(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team
Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.  Failure to be both VERIRIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz at the time of proposal submission will result in the offeror's proposal being deemed non-responsive. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 660-14-107 - Energy Efficiency Upgrades Phase IV at the George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center (VAMC), Salt Lake City, Utah.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. 

The Salt Lake City VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to provide all A/E services for Energy Efficiency Upgrades Phase IV.  The work will include but not be limited to: replacing various air handlers units (AHUs) and associated equipment, replacing VAV Boxes, and installing variable frequency drives on electric pump motors supporting the chilled water system.

The AE firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired construction work.  Microsoft Project scheduling and management software will be used by both the A&E and Contractors to allow for regular tracking of schedules and work by the VAMC.   Schedules with MS Project will be regularly sent to the COR upon project initiation and whenever significant changes occur in the schedule.   All work must be designed within a construction cost range of $500,000 to $1,000,000.  The AE will provide an initial estimate of cost to perform the above work and will design only those items that can be provided within the cost limitation. Submission requirements are the initial estimate and preliminary design submission, a 50% design submission, and a 95% design submission.  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the AE to minimize impact of the construction.  The AE will provide documents at each submission as indicated in the statement of work.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do, type in 330 in the "Find A Form" block and click on search. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. Interested firms should submit one (1) copy of their current SF 330 no later than 12:00 PM Mountain Standard Time (MST) January 28, 2013 to andrew.stigen@va.gov. The emailed file shall not exceed 5MB in total.  

Offerors will be evaluated on the following criteria:
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;
(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials;
(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;
(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;
(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and
(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
(7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.
(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team
Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.  Failure to be both VERIRIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz at the time of proposal submission will result in the offeror's proposal being deemed non-responsive. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

<DESC>Engility Corporation/L-3 Service Inc. was awarded a $9,746,234 cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) bridge contract with a 12-month period of performance for technical and engineering support services in the areas of requirement specification, design, implementation, test, management and maintenance of laboratory/information system and project/program related software under the auspices of the Avionics Department, Systems Integration Branch, and Code 4.5.1 of NAWCAD, Patuxent River, MD.
<p>The majority of the work (about 95%) will be performed at NAVAIR, Patuxent River, MD and about 5% of the work will be performed at the Contractor site in Lexington Park, MD. The contract was procured on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source. A cost plus fixed fee contract was deemed to be in the best interest of the Government. Uncertainties involved in the performance of this contract do not permit cost and quantities to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to utilize any other type of fixed price contract.</p>
