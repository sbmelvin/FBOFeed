2. System OverviewLOGFAC resides on Global Combat Support System (GCSS-AF) infrastructure and supports logistics/operational planning staffs at the HQ Air Staff, MAJCOM and Unit levels by determining wartime consumables and pre-positioning of AF assets for deliberate planning based on the War Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4).
In this capacity, DCAPES-LOGFAC:
.	Supports the development/maintenance of OPLAN Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA).	Supports force feasibility/capability assessments and War Reserve Materiel asset visibility.	Projects sustainment requirements; what-if functions to determine shortfalls and associated costs.	Produces the munitions and non-munitions War Consumable Distribution Objection (WCDO).	Generates assessments based on inventory data received from the Combat Ammunition System (CAS), the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) and the standard Base Supply System (SBSS).	Virtual Munitions Build - utilizing WCDO or Contingency requirements to answer the "what if" questions.  Attempts to build munitions end items based on component availability by base or theater of operation.

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s).

These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support. This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

	Vessel must provide certificates of quality for last and next to last cargoes.  These certificates should contain all test data required by specification for the products that were previously loaded (last and next to last).  They shall be submitted for each shore tank as well as the vessel tanks after loading (composite sample).  Results of typical are not acceptable.  Additionally the following are required for the specific products mentioned:

-  Naphtha/Condensates:  Mercaptan Sulphur, reported in Parts Per Million (PPM) or mass percent, or doctor test (ASTMD 4952).

- Gasoline (motor or aviation):  state whether the previous product was leaded or unleaded.  This is needed to determine cargo tank safe entry testing requirements.

	The use of copper and copper alloys (brass, bronze, etc.) In vessel compartments, pipelines, heating coils, fittings, etc. Is not permitted in vessels chartered by MSC to haul petroleum products, unless vessel possesses a current DESC waiver.

	If vessel cargo tanks have heating coils, provide the coil type or composition (such as stainless steel, copper, etc.), date that the heating coils were last used and pressure tested, and the results of the test (passed or failed).  Date of last pressure test cannot exceed 12 months for duration of this charter.  Vessel tanks with copper or yellow metal compounds are normally not acceptable for jet fuel cargoes.

	Vessel must have segregated ballast tanks (SBT) and inert gas system (IGS).

	If vessel cargo tanks are coated, provide the coating type (epoxy, inorganic zinc, etc). Coal tar coating is not acceptable. If tanks are not coated then state none. Coatings that are incompatible with the fuel to be carried will be rejected.

	Vessel must be able to take upper, middle, lower, bottom, and all-level samples of the cargo (to include OBQ & ROB) without contaminating them from the sampling location.  If unable to do so or if the sampling location is contaminated or suspected to be contaminated, charterer will require open sampling on a tank by tank basis, consistent with safety and local terminal regulations.

RFI Summary:
1.  The Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) is issuing this RFI to receive comments and related documentation in regard to the attached Statement of Work (SOW) titled: Southwest Border Communications Interoperability Analysis and Design.  AQD is acting on behalf of the Department of Interior, Office of the Secretary, Office of the Chief Information Officer, Enterprise Infrastructure Division, National Radio and Spectrum Program Management Office (DOI/OS/OCIO/EID/NRSPMO).  This is a Request for Information and is for planning purposes only. 
2.  DOI NRSPMO is responsible for oversight of the Department's Land Mobile Radio (LMR) and frequency management activities.  The Department's LMR systems are used primarily by six bureaus for daily operations of law enforcement, wild land fire, and natural resource management.  It is estimated the Department has over 60,000 LMR assets, 16,000 frequency assignments, and 2,400 radio infrastructure facilities.  The DOI NRSPMO primary goals are to create radio interoperability, consolidate radio systems, and ensure that radio communication is available for emergency use throughout the DOI.  NRSPMO works closely with the Enterprise Radio Advisory Counsel (ERAC) for direction and guidance.  
3.  The DOI senior managers in conjunction with the Office of Inspector General, have identified the United State (U.S.) Southwest Border (which includes California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas) as being radio communication mission critical, because of the intense criminal and illegal immigration activity.  The Department ERAC has tasked and funded the NRSPMO to conduct an analysis and develop a comprehensive multi year plan that would alleviate communication problems and implement interoperability throughout U.S. Southwest Border. 
4.	AQD will conduct this RFI as the first step in a multi-step process (FAR Part 15.202).  If you are interested in competing for this effort, you may participate by submitting your comments in the categories below.  a.	Proposed Technical Conceptb.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2010-065-DLM and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38 (1/11/2010).

Period of performance:  The proposed performance for this service will consist of one (12) month basic contract period (February 1, 2010  January 31, 2011) and will include two (2) options to renew for a twelve month period.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711 and the business size standard is 500 Employees. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the National Institute of Human Genome Research (NHGRI) Intramural Research Program, Office of the Clinical Director requires statistical and administrative support.  The statistical expert should be a senior level expert in the development and execution of clinical research protocols. The Office of the Clinical Director also requires administrative support assistant for the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) and will provide written reports to the Director, NHGR and to NHGRI, Institutional Review Board (IRB) as required by the DSMB charter. 

Background Information:

The NHGRI Intramural Research Program, through the OCD, conducts natural history studies and therapeutic drug trials on rare diseases; statistical expertise is essential to determine the number of patients needed to discern a difference among groups and to choose an appropriate study design.
Scope of Project/Work:

The Office of the Clinical Director (OCD), NHGRI, seeks contract assistance for two areas crucial to the mission of the Institute. The first involves senior level statisticians to assist in the development and execution of clinical research protocols. Issues to be addressed include power analyses, sample size, group analyses, trends, and stopping rules, as well as more complex topics. The NHGRI Intramural Research Program, through the OCD, conducts natural history studies and therapeutic drug trials on rare diseases; statistical expertise is essential to determine the number of patients needed to discern a difference among groups and to choose an appropriate study design. This work is especially critical for trials involving investigational drugs (e.g., nitisinone for alkaptonuria and pirfenidone for pulmonary fibrosis in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome), since these require an Investigational New Drug exemption for which annual reports to the FDA are obligatory. The Investigational New Drug exemptions are held by a member of the NHGRI faculty. In addition, future clinical trials are planned for rare diseases such as Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy and Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease; these studies will require extensive statistical consultations. Some pre-clinical studies also require statistical expertise provided by this contract.

The second area of support required by the NHGRI OCD involves administrative assistance for the Institutes Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). This committee serves the NHGRI Institutional Review Board (IRB) by reviewing clinical protocols in which there is an intervention, especially if a placebo is involved. The DSMB advises on issues such as study design, power estimates, stopping rules, interim analyses, and adverse event reporting. Members of the DSMB also assess objectively the seriousness of unexpected adverse events. The DSMB provides statistical, clinical research, and medical expertise on an essentially volunteer basis, except for expenses. Contract support is needed for arranging meetings, recording minutes, and communicating with and reimbursing members of the DSMB. The contract agency also provides formal, written reports to the Director, NHGRI, and to the NHGRI IRB, as required by the DSMB charter. 

This is a notice of intent to negotiate with EMMES CORP., 401 N Washington Street, Suite 700, Rockville, Maryland 20850-1737 to provide statistical expertise and administrative support. This group has been providing this exact support to the NHGRI for the past 6 years, and has performed in an exemplary fashion, with excellent statistical consultations and timely and accurate documentation of DSMB proceedings and correspondence. EMMES Corp. has extensive experience in statistical consultation and IRB/DSMB administration for NIH institutes and other biomedical entities. The company is local and can respond to requests for assistance in a timely fashion. In addition, the Clinical Director of NHGRI has experience working with this company through protocol 86-EI-0062. EMMES also supports the NEI IRB and DSMB. 

For statistical work, initial and follow-up meetings will be held at the NHGRI offices of the investigators seeking consultation. Much of the data analysis and planning, however, will be performed at the EMMES Corporation offices in Rockville.  For administrative support to the DSMB, the work will be performed at the EMMES Corporation offices, except for the annual meeting of the DSMB, which is held on the NIH campus in Bethesda.

For statistical consulting, reports of sample size, power analysis, stopping rules, etc., are required to be delivered by the Contractor to the NHGRI physician or scientist seeking the consultation. For administrative assistance to the DSMB, the deliverables consist of the arranging of DSMB meetings and conference calls, and the preparation of minutes of the meetings, agendas, certificates of compliance with Conflict of Interest rules, and reports of deliberations. These must be certified by the Director of NHGRI and delivered to the NHGRI Institutional Review Board and the NHGRI Clinical Director, in a timely fashion as stipulated by the DSMB Manual of Operations.

The Offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items. As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered;  3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; 4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; and 5) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION:<BR> a. General: This proposed contract is for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Construction phase Services (CPS) which will be procured in accordance with PL-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and implemented in FAR Part 36.6. <BR><BR>The proposed A-E contract will support the construction of an approximately $1B Hospital located at Ft Hood, Texas and could include CPS for various military and some Civil Works projects which are generally within, but not limited to the Southwestern Division (SWD) regional boundaries (TX, LA, NM, AR, OK) to allow the flexibility of sharing capacity with other Corps Districts (outside SWD boundaries) and other Federal agencies in unique cases. This flexibility would only be exercised in unique cases (anticipate less than 10%). North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711.<BR><BR>This announcement is open only to SMALL BUSINESSES.   The prime A-E firm must perform 50% or more of the work on this contract.   Anticipated contract award will be on or about May 2010.  One Indefinite Delivery Contract(IDC) contract will be awarded from this announcement for a cumulative amount of $20,000,000 with a minimum guarantee amount of $5,000.00 only for the base period of 2 years with 3 year options and for a term not to exceed five years.  <BR><BR>Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.601-4(b).<BR><BR>Price will not be used as a criterion for selection. There will be NO design services included in this contract.<BR><BR>Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.<BR><BR>b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders. The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall furnish all personnel, services, materials, supplies and supervision required to fully complete each task order.   Personnel provided by this contract will operate out of Government supplied facilities.<BR><BR>c. Contract Award Procedure: <BR>The proposed services will be obtained by Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov .<BR><BR>2.

<DESC>POC Mr. Rich Feibelman, (601) 631-5838.  Up to two indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded, each with a base period and four option periods.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The work consists of professional A-E Value Engineering services performed in support of major civil works projects or elements thereof, or work for other agencies being accomplished primarily within the New Orleans and Vicksburg Districts, but may be within the Mississippi Valley Division and other areas as needed to support the mission of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The cumulative total of the task orders issued over the life of the contract shall not exceed $2.0 million.  The contract base period will be 365 days from the date of contract award or exhaustion of the contract value of $2.0 million, whichever comes first.  The period of any option will be 365 days from the date the Contracting Officer signs the exercise of the option or until exhaustion of the remaining portion of the $2.0 million contract value, whichever comes first.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders.  Tasks will be divided based on specialized experience, past performance, project schedules, and/or current A-E workload.  It is anticipated that the estimated workload for each performance period will be $400,000.00.  Contract award is anticipated in September 2010.  This announcement is set aside for small businesses. The small business size standard for A-E services (NAICS Code 541330) is $4.5 million.  Subcontracting intentions are outlined in the SF 330.<BR>2.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  A-E service capabilities are required for various projects and support for other agencies.  More specifically, services of qualified A-E firms are sought to conduct and/or participate in Value Engineering (V-E) studies and related technical review and design analysis of civil works, military and infrastructure projects.

(F) DoD contract awards in the past 12 months: The greater the awards the lesser the consideration.  In the final selection process, the most highly qualified firms will be interviewed and will have to demonstrate the ability to perform to the satisfaction of the Vicksburg and New Orleans Districts.<BR>4.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services (WS) is seeking interested parties capable of manufacturing GonaCon Immunocontraceptive Vaccine. Manufacturing must be conducted under Good Laboratory Practices, Good Manufacturing Practices or similar ISO certifications. Manufacturing would be required at a minimum of twice per year.
<p><br /><br />The GonaConTM Immunocontraceptive Vaccine formulation consists of a multi-step process where mammalian Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) is conjugated to a mollusk hemocyanin and emulsified in a mineral oil based adjuvant to form the final product (Figure 1). Prior to conjugation the hemocyanin carrier protein must be maleimide activated. Dialysis is performed to remove excess maleimide formed after the activation. GnRH is then conjugated to the maleimide activated hemocyanin. The aduvant is formulated separately from the rest of the vaccine by preparing a suspension of killed bacteria in light mineral oil. Final preparation of the vaccine involves vortex mixing the peptide/hemocyanin conjugate with the adjuvant preparation and producing the final emulsion by running the preparation through an emulsifier. The final emulsion is loaded into 3 ml polyethylene syringes. Individual syringes are then labeled, packaged and shipped to a predetermined USDA facility. All phases of manufacturing must be conducted under clean room conditions. Specialized equipment requirements include a spectrophotometer for quality assurance monitoring, and a emulsification instrument capable of producing 6000 psi (e.g., Microfluidics Model M110L or equivalent).</p>

<h1 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">Expression of Interest for Turn Key Liquid Helium Refrigeration/Liquefaction System</h1>
<p>Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC (BSA) is seeking expressions of interest from manufacturers regarding the production of a turn key Liquid Helium Refrigeration/Liquefaction System, which will be located at Brookhaven National Laboratory ( BNL), Upton , NY 11973.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BSA, under Contract DE-AC02-98CH10886 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the operation of BNL, is designing and constructing a new synchrotron radiation light source, hereinafter referred to as National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II),</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NSLS-II project includes the design, construction, installation, and commissioning of accelerator hardware, civil construction, and central facilities required to produce a new synchrotron light source. The project includes a highly optimized 3GeV electron storage ring, full-energy injector, experimental beam lines and optics, and appropriate support equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NSLS II RF cavity installation will be similar to the Canadian Light Source, Diamond Light Source, Shanghai Light Source and Beijing Electron Position Collider with the difference being the NSLS II System is a larger installation with 6 superconducting cavities and require upwards of 900 Watts of LHe capacity, additional information is provided below, specific requirements are provided in the attached specification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">General Manufacturing/Testing/Installation Description</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">The storage ring will contain two superconducting (SC) Radio Frequency (RF) sections that will replace the energy the electrons lose during their circulation. These two SC RF sections will require cooling by liquid Helium supplied from an independent cryogenic system.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">The cryogenic system shall be capable to provide the liquid Helium flow rate up to 300 liters/hour and handle the heat load of ~900 W. The superconducting cavities require extremely tight control of the pressure variations within +/- 1.5 mBar during delivery of the liquid Helium to the cavity helium tanks.</p>

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Wellfleet Software Corporation, of Reading, MA, for the purchase of the WellGEO RegRep 4 product.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for a registry/repository of weather datasets and associated weather data access services using a variety of vocabularies and classification schemes which will meet the demands of the FAA's NextGen Network Enabled Weather (NNEW) program here at NOAA. Wellfleet is the only vendor that offers the registry/repository that meets our technical requirements. Specifically, no other vendor can meet the requirements for registry/repository software. The NNEW program has identified the OASIS ebXML registry/repository standard as the most appropriate technology choice. The ebXML registry/repository standard is currently in the process of transitioning from version 3 to version 4, and version 4 has reached official draft status in the OASIS registry/repository Technical Committee. Version 4 supports a number a new features that will be particularly important in the context of NextGen, including the ability to federate all or portions of registries with one another to support a variety of multi-organization interactions. Wellfleet is the only source of a registry/repository implementation that is compliant with version 4 of the ebXML registry/repository specification at this time. The expected delivery date is February 8, 2010.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC><p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids, quotes or proposals.</p>
<p>ARS intends to award a one year purchase order on a sole source basis, for The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for Statistics Canada's Banff software.<br />The Fellegi-Holt (F-H) principles of statistical data editing are internationally considered the gold standard upon which a statistical data editing system should be built, and NASS needs an F-H based system to integrate into its editing and imputation procedures for its sample survey program to reduce an increasing untenable manual, survey data review workload. The use of such a system will enable the agency to reduce the costs of its editing processes, while maintaining (or improving) the quality of the resulting survey data.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada's Banff is the only comprehensive statistical data editing package that fully implements all of the F-H principles. In doing so, it contains modules for edit checking for consistency (prior to any data collection), error localization (that fully implements the F-H minimum change criteria), a wide array of imputation choices (all of which are fully integrated with the edit), and automated outlier detection (implementing the associated Hidiroglou-Berthelot algorithm). Banff is the only statistical data editing product on the market that is fully documented and provides both on-site and remote training and support. It is also the only statistical editing package that is written in SAS, which is essential to our implementation of it into our operational systems.

<DESC>Introduction: Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b) (1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Warfighter Protection and Aerial Delivery Directorate (WarPAD) at the Natick Soldier Research, Development, & Engineering Center, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Specialty Defense Systems, An Armor Holdings Co, of Jessup, Pa.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. No solicitation document is available. <BR><BR>1) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs:<BR>The Commander U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command wrote an Urgent Statement of Need for a load-bearing chest rig to be compatible with the ESAPI ballistic plate carrier- change 6.  The Army may have an item that meets this need.  This procurement is to conduct a rapid evaluation of the Army Tactical Assault Panel (TAP) Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE), BAE part number 4090NS coyote brown to meet this urgent need.  The Marine Corps will refer to the TAP as the Marine Chest Rig.  <BR><BR>3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  BAE (Specialty Defense) is the only source of this military unique item.  No other supplier has a production line for this item that integrates with the MOLLE system or ESAPI Carrier.  No other company sells it commercially.<BR><BR>4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  An internet web survey was conducted.  Attendance at the recent Sergeant Majors Nominative Conference identified no other possible sources for this item.  No other item meets the requirements for this combat load-carrying device for direct attachment to body armor.<BR><BR>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:   BAE has a production line available for producing this small quantity of test items in 3 weeks.  Any other vendor would need to reverse engineer it, learn how to make this item, and order materials.  This would be a 9-month effort.  <BR><BR>6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:<BR>If this item is bought in large quantities by PM-ICE or DLA, it will be procured from a Mil-Spec TDP package produced so it can be full and open competition or it will replace the current MOLLE Fighting Load-carrier already under contract with BAE and Eagle.  <BR><BR>6. Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, via e-mail at david.barceleau@us.army.mil, no later than 26 January 2010, 12:00 pm EST.  <BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>Ambulance Patient Compartment Response to Side Impact
<SOLNBR>_NA_
<RESPDATE>022610
<ARCHDATE>02272010
<CONTACT>Diane J Meeder, Phone (412)386-4412, Email DMeeder@cdc.gov
<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in partnership with the Ambulance Manufacturers Division (AMD) of the National Truck Equipment Association (NTEA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), is undertaking an effort to improve the safety of the patient compartment of an ambulance. One building block in that effort will be the development of underlying crash criteria for frontal and side impacts. Once completed, these data will support key components of the design and testing criteria to improve seating, restraints, patient gurneys, and equipment mounts. The overarching goal of the project is to reduce the likelihood any of these devices would fail structurally, in the event of a vehicle crash or evasive maneuver, causing injury to the crew, patients, or other individuals while in transit.
<p>The team has already completed work to characterize vehicle response in a frontal crash event. The team is now pursuing testing to characterize the response of an ambulance in a side impact crash event. To that end, NIOSH has developed a request for quotes to acquire the services of a test facility to complete all required testing. That contract is expected to be finalized by March, 26, 2010, with the hope that side impact testing can be completed by May 16, 2010. As currently written, the government may cover the bulk of the cost of testing but has not allocated funding for the procurement of the two required ambulances.</p>
<p>The testing contract anticipates the testing of two ambulances: a Type II and either a Type I or III. Each ambulance will be tested twice, with impacts to the street and curb side respectively, for a total of four side impact tests. Testing will be conducted in accordance with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's, "Side Impact Crashworthiness Evaluation, Crash Test Protocol (Version V)," dated May 2008.</p>
<p>Note 1: All vehicle response data (accelerometer data collected on the chassis and patient compartment, respectively) will be shared with all current partners and used by them to support the development of a "side impact test corridor" for all ambulances. Eventually, the data resulting from this testing will be made available to the public.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, the NIOSH and its collaborative partners are seeking additional partners to provide material and financial support. That support can take many forms. Specific opportunities to provide support are outlined below:</p>
<p>1. The team seeks one (1) Type II van type ambulance for destructive testing. The ambulance need not be new or drivable but it shall be largely free of rust in the frame and patient compartment. The ambulance chassis shall be a 2000 model year or newer. The ambulance shall not have any crash damage other than superficial dents and scratches.</p>
<p>2. The team seeks one (1) Type I or Type III box on chassis type ambulance for destructive testing. The ambulance need not be new or drivable but it shall be largely free of rust in the frame and patient compartment. Both the ambulance chassis and patient compartment shall be a 2000 model year or newer. The ambulance shall not have any crash damage other than superficial dents and scratches. The patient compartment may be a new or used patient compartment mounted on a used van or truck chassis appropriate for this application.</p>
<p>Note 2: Prospective partners should not feel compelled to provide both ambulances for testing. The project team will likely seek more than one partner to cover the cost of this effort.</p>
<p>Recognizing more than one prospective partner might emerge from this announcement, and also in recognition that the project team has a requirement for only two ambulances; a prospective partner could improve his offer by providing financial support to mitigate some of the costs associated with this test program.</p>
<p>Note 3: Prospective partners should not feel compelled to offer financial consideration in addition to an ambulance. However, should more than 2 entities express an interest in participating the government and its partners will chose the offer(s) most advantageous to their interests.</p>
<p>Examples of additional costs that could be considered by the prospective partner:</p>
<p>1. The cost to transport (drive or tow) the offered ambulance(s) to the test facility. (est. at $2,000 per vehicle)</p>
<p>2. The cost to prepare the vehicle(s) for crash testing (treating fuel systems, removing or covering identifying marking if desired, etc.) (est. at $3,000 per vehicle).</p>
<p>3. The cost to dispose of the vehicle(s) once all testing is complete. (If the prospective partner prefers, he can regain possession of the vehicle from the test facility upon its release by the government.) (est. at $2,500 per vehicle)</p>
<p>4. The cost of one or more moving deformable barriers (MDB) required for testing of the offered ambulance(s) (est. at $3,000 for each MDB, 2 MDB per vehicle, a total of 4 for the test program). A new MDB is required for each test.</p>
<p>5. The cost of instrumentation required to document the vehicle's response in each side impact event (est. at $4,000 per vehicle).</p>
<p>6. The cost to perform each test (est. at $6,000 for each of 4 tests - 2 per vehicle)</p>
<p>Potential benefits to the proposed new partners:</p>
<p>1. This is an opportunity for the partner to have his vehicle patient compartment and patient compartment mounting system tested in a manner consistent with a proposed new SAE Recommended Practice. In the future, primary project partners may utilize the proposed SAE Recommended Practice to evaluate occupant restraint and equipment integrity in side impact design cases.</p>
<p>2. The partner will be invited to participate in the team's deliberations regarding the development of the SAE Recommended Practice for Side Impact Testing.</p>
<p>3. The proposed partner could utilize this opportunity to test new interior configurations, seating systems, restraints, gurney mounts, gurneys, equipment mounts or interior delethalization measures.</p>
<p>Note 4: The government does not plan to include instrumented manikins in the proposed testing program. Should a prospective partner wish to evaluate a seating and/or restraint system, he will be responsible for the costs associated with such an addition to the test program. The resulting data from said manikins will be the sole property of the prospective partner and will not be shared with the government or its existing partners without the expressed written consent of the prospective partner.</p>
<p>Note 5: While all partners, government and private, expect to use the resulting vehicle response data to support the proposed SAE Recommended Practice for side impact testing, participation in this study will not constitute "passing" any form of government certification or validation testing and may not be advertised as same.<br /><br />If interested, a prospective partner shall provide the following information to the NIOSH technical representative identified at the bottom of this announcement:</p>
<p>1. Chassis vehicle identification number (VIN) of proposed test vehicle.</p>
<p>2. Completed vehicle details, as contained on the GSA Certification Sticker, for the proposed test vehicle.</p>
<p>3. A series of exterior photos of the proposed vehicle from all four sides, as well as, a series of photos covering the interior of the patient compartment.</p>
<p>4. An itemized listing of those items the proposed partner wishes to contribute to financially, if any, to defray the cost of the testing program; or,</p>
<p>5. A single dollar amount the proposed partner wishes to contribute to the test effort, if any, to defray the cost of the testing program.</p>
<p>Note 6: The test vehicles and any financial consideration offered as a result of this announcement will be provided to the selected test facility by the proposed partner(s) directly. The government will not take possession of the vehicles nor will they enter into a contractual agreement with the proposed vendor to transfer funds or resulting data.</p>
<p>NIOSH, AMD-NTEA, NHTSA, nor the GSA promise to purchase, analyze or test any of the offered equipment. This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner chosen, based on an engineering assessment and financial evaluation, will be positioned to share expertise with the full project team of researchers and will have an opportunity to shape the outcome of the proposed SAE Recommended Practice to be drafted by the project team. Those selected to participate will also be offered the opportunity to participate, onsite, during the testing of their vehicle. However, they will not be present during the testing of a vehicle produced by another vendor. <br /><br /><strong>Responses must be&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">received</span>&nbsp;by NIOSH&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">no later than March 5, 2010</span>.</strong> Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after that date. Vendors should note any proprietary data as such. If any data is to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included with the statement of propriety.</p>

<DESC>The Department of State intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole-source basis to Intelsat General Corporation, 6550 Rock Spring Dr., Bethesda, MD, 20817-1112.  The award is to lease three dedeicated 64 kilo bits per second (kbps) circuits in support of the existing dedicated circuits between Washington and Moscow, Russia; Almaty, Kazakhstan; and Minsk, Belarus.  No contracts will be awarded onthe basis of offers received in response to this notice.  Responses to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address not later than 3:00 pm., Eastern Standard Time, January 26, 2010; goudyfd@state.gov.  All inquiries should be submitted via email to Felicia Goudy, goudyfd@state.gov.


JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of 3 (three) dedicated 64 kbps circuits in support of an International Agreement between Washington and Minsk, Belarus; Almaty, Kazakhstan; and Moscow, Russia.  The estimated cost is $220,956 for one year and $448,560 for the base year and one option year.

2.	The Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM), Office of Chief Information Officer (CIO) has a critical need to lease three dedicated 64 kilo bits per second (kbps) circuits in support of existing dedicated circuits between Washington and Minsk; Almaty; and Moscow.   

Background: The circuits support the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center (NRRC).  The NRRC was established under the September 15th 1987 agreement to exchange official government communications in support of the first Strategic Arms Limitation and Intermediated Range Nuclear Missile Treaties (START I/INF). The U.S. Secretary of State and Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the 1987 NRRC agreement. The Lisbon Protocol of START Treaty in 1992 assumed obligations of the Republics of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.  The International Agreement requires multiple and diverse dedicated satellite paths to support telecommunications requirements. The 1987 NRRC agreement and subsequent classified Presidential Directives required the Chief Information Officer for the U.S. State Department lead all international technical discussions concerning NRRC telecommunications. The international discussions are held on an annual basis and are formally designated U.S. - Russian Technical Experts Meetings.  The State Department CIO, along with his Russian counterpart signs the resulting NRRC Protocol at the Technical Experts Meeting each year. This NRRC Protocol contains all agreed upon technical requirements to maintain critical NRRC communications. 

  		
3.	The contractor is to provide a dedicated 64 kbs circuits between the Department of State, Silver Spring Maryland and Minsk, Moscow and Almaty teleports.  Other technical requirements include the use of the INTELSAT 342 via F1 at Silver Spring space platform, the C band frequency range, an E1 drop and insert satellite modem, an Newbridge 3600 multiplexer supporting RS422 and RS 232 interfaces. The contractor will also provide 24 hours on site technical support and work closely with designated government technical staff in trouble shooting circuit, satellite and multiplexer interface problems.  Estimated cost is $220,956 for one year and $480,560 for the base year and one option year.  


4.	The statutory authorities permitting other than full and open competition are as follows:   41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

5.	Intelsat General is the only vendor able to provide both technical and operational support at this time because they are the sole owner and operator of the Silver Spring teleport and have agreed to meet all government requirements for the circuit.

6.	Efforts to solicit offers will be attempted utilizing FedBizOpps to publicize the requirement.
 
7.	The Contracting Officer determined the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on the following documents provided by the vendor:  Current purchase order and historical pricing data in contract files for the same work.

8.	Limited market research was completed for this project because Intelsat General is the only vendor able to provide technical and operational support because they are the sole owner and operator of the Silver Spring teleport.

9.	There are no further facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

10.	Notice of Intent to Sole Source will be publicized on FedBizOpps to afford potential sources the ability to express, in writing, an interest in this acquisition.

11.	Intelsat General is the only vendor able to provide technical and operational support because they are the sole owner and operator of the Silver Spring teleport.  An RFI will be publicized to acquire information on alternate sources and methods that may satisfy this ongoing requirement and the requirement will be competed at the expiration of this Order.  Additionally, talks between Department of State and Minsk, Belarus; Almaty, Kazakhstan; and Moscow, Russia continue in the effort to establish a new International Agreement in which to base this future procurement.

<SUBJECT>RECOVERY - Department of State - Privacy Office Support Services - Modification of SASI Task Order No. 9
<SOLNBR>M02-SAQMMA09L0757
<CONTACT>Lanah B Hamrick, Contracting Officer, Phone 7038756842, Fax 7038756085, Email hamricklb@state.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY - AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009, AS AMENDED.  It is the intent of the Department of State to execute Modification M02 to Task Order S-AQMMA-09-L-0757, awarded to Systems Research and Applications Corporation, 4350 Fair Lakes Court, Fairfax, VA, under the Department's Security Assurance Services and Innovation (SASI) Blanket Purchase Agreements, to add new Functional Task Area 3 to assist the Privacy Division (PRV) to develop new policies, training, and awareness communications that support the Department-wide deployment of data loss prevention (DLP).  The Privacy Division, in a collaborative effort with the Bureau of Information Resource Management and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security will draw on American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) cyber security funds for Department-wide DLP capability.  The DLP will result in a depth of monitoring of user-generated information.  With the availability of ARRA funds, these services could be added to the task order; however, the ceiing must be increased by approximately $174,000 to accommodate the work.  The new FTA will be performed on a firm fixed price basis and will be separate from the other work of the task order for accountability and reporting purposes under the Act. The performance of FTA3 is limited to a 5-month period beginning on/about February 1, 2010.  The primary place(s) of performance are the Department of State locations in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (Main State and Annex 2).

FTA3 requires performance of the following:
Policy and Procedures.  The contractor shall be responsible fo reviewing existing DoS privacy policies and enhancing those policies or assisting with the development of new privacy policies pertaining to data loss prevention in the following areas:
--Department of State business requirements and policies;
--Workplace monitoring;
--Privacy for the new form of monitoring;
--Targeted surveillance of a specific employee's use of IT resources based on evidence assembled using data loss prevention.

The contractor shall be required to prepare department notices describing the new monitoring to the Department of State.  The contractor will initiate or further devleop, as required, program management and communications plans, schedules, budgets and performance measures.  These activities will help to accomplish Bureau of Administration and Bureau of Information Resource Management goals in alignment with the Department strategic and tactical plans as appropriate.

Communications Support:  The contractor shall assist the Privacy Division in creating computer generate text warning messages to the user for various PII data breaches over unsecured e-mail or orphan files that have been retained beyond their useful life located on servers. 

Monthly Reporting:  The contractor shall periodically (bi-weekly) assess quality objectives and performance standards and communicate current and ongoing progress in the monthly activity reports and other status meetings scheduled by the Government task manager.

J&A to Add FTA3 and Increase Ceilingl:
The increase in the task order ceiling by $174,000 enables the contractor to provide an additional resource to SASI TO-9 to develop new privacy policies, training and awareness communications that support the Department-wide deployment of data loss prevention (DLP). The additional resource will be funded using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.  This new task will begin on/about February 1, 2010.  The increase permits the Privacy Division to address the increased workload associated primarily with the requirements of the OMB Memorandum (07-16), Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information via use of data loss prevention software. The Privacy Division will continue its progress on analyses under the existing support services task contractual vehicle with SRA. The SASI Task Order No. 9 (SASI TO-9) already includes the applicable labor category and task areas within its statement of work.  Although the scope of the Task Order will not change, the increase of the ceiling by $174,000 constitutes new work per FAR 8.405-6(b)(2).  The solicitation that resulted in the award of the task order was released to eight (8) Security Assurance Services and Innovation (SASI) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) holders.  Two (2) proposals were received, from which one award (to SRA) was made.  FAR 8.405-6(d) does not apply as the requirements to which this J&A applies are for services, and FAR Part 11.105(a)(3) for posting acquisitions is applicable to products that are procured on the basis of a particular brand name or essential feature peculiar to one manufacturer and not to services.  However, because the additional task, which will be performed on a firm fixed price basis, is ARRA funded, the intent to add this task to TO-9 and the execution of the finalized modification to add the task will be synopsized in FedBizOpps as required by FAR Part 5.704 and FAR Part 7.05.  SRA, the SASI BPA contractor that was awarded Privacy Task Order No. 9, was evaluated as the most technically qualified for the services to be provided under the task order.  The SRA staff currently assigned to SASI TO-9 have the requisite experience with, and knowledge of, Department of State business processes, IT systems, and PII collections.  Their accrued knowledge and organization-wide perspective is the result of having performed privacy risk reviews across all business areas of the Department.  SRA has already established a baseline surrounding the roughly 100 major IT systems that comprise the bulk of PII assets.  An additional resource provided under and managed by the SRA project team will unburden government staff of the need to orient new contractor staff and will avoid a lengthy learning curve lapse in the face of fast critical timelines imposed by these Presidential directives.  Because SASI TO-9 was competed among SASI BPA contractors, it still represents the best value to meet the Governments needs as the discounted BPA burdened labor hour rates, which formed the basis for SRAs successful proposal, have not changed. The increase in ceiling is specific to Task Area 3 and will be tracked and reported following Recovery.gov guidelines. The task order provides services that are critical to complying with OMB 07-16 and other privacy related requirements.  Inability to meet the specified requirements could affect the Departments mission to safeguard and protect personally identifiable information.  The contractor is already providing comprehensive support for A/GIS/IPS/PRV programs and is able to provide an integrated and effective technical approach to meet the specified in-scope requirements with a an additional resource.

The current contract provides operation and maintenance services for the<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </strong>John F. Williams Coast Guard Building, 408 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, MA 02203. The current contract extension expires January 31, 4010. The Government is in the process of procuring follow-on services. This sole source extension is necessary to bridge the gap between the current contract and new award to ensure continuity of services and support the transition to a new award.
<p>&nbsp;he Description of the work to be performed: The Contractor shall be responsible to provide all management, supervision, labor, subcontractors, materials, supplies and equipment, and shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective completion of all services described within the current contract. The contractor shall be fully responsible for providing all customer service, mechanical operations and maintenance, incidental repairs, minor repairs, and quality control at the<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </strong>John F. Williams Coast Guard Building in Boston, MA. The period of performance will be four (4) months.</p>

<p>&nbsp;This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services. A lapse in service will have a detrimental effect on the ability of the General Services Administration to provide building services to federal agencies in the New England region. This extension will provide services without disruption for the operation of facilities of this size and complexity by a firm that is familiar with the equipment and hold current security clearances. Lumus has been performing these services since 2004 and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional 4-month performance period.</p>

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.5 to CAMPBELL FOUNDRY, CO., 800 Bergen Street, Harrison, NY 07029.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures  --- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Campbell Foundry is the only known source capable of meeting the Governments requirements due to the unique capability to provide support and service for the procurement of grey cast iron tunnel sections --- panels, material certifications and accessories.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than Thursday, 28 January 2010, 4:00 P.M., CST.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  Interested parties may submit any information for consideration to ellaine.r.james@usace.army.mil with solicitation number referenced in the subject line.  For technical questions, please contact Bradley Foust, 601-634-3916.<BR><BR>1.  The US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory (GSL) has been tasked by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science and Technology Directorate, Infrastructure and Geophysical Division to conduct research to design, test, and evaluate material/structural solutions to mitigate the effects of terrorist attack on underground tunnels.  Vintage cast iron tunnels are of particular interest due to the potential vulnerability when subjected to short duration loads such as blast or kinetic energy penetrators (KEP) threats.  The structural response of this material, when subjected to blast, is very brittle in nature; therefore, it is imperative that we simulate this behavior in our experiments.  A misrepresentation of this material would be detrimental to our research effort.  Campbell Foundry Company has produced this material in the past for ERDC.  A prior experimental effort utilized Campbell Foundry to cast panels for a subscale evaluation of mitigation materials to diminish near-contact blast effects to cast iron panels.  Campbell Foundry has also cast tunnel sections for other government agencies, such as the Technical Support Working Group (TSWG), and still has the patterns to do so again. <BR> <BR>2.  Campbell Foundry Company has been in business since 1921 and has successfully produced the gray cast iron to meet the very low ductility that the vintage cast iron exhibits.  Cast iron typically developed by the industry today is considerably more ductile than vintage cast iron; thus, special effort is required.  TSWG, along with Weidlinger Associates, has recently used Campbell Foundry to cast 40 degree tunnel sections in their combined research effort investigating brittle cast iron tunnels.  Not only that, but most importantly, Weidlinger has successfully modeled the brittle cast iron material in their computational effort simulating the response of the brittle cast iron to blast.  As mentioned above, ERDC-GSL has been recently tasked by DHS to investigate the brittle cast iron tunnels as well.  Additionally, we are tasked to collaborate with TSWG to build on their research results since it is applicable to the DHS project.  Due to their valuable knowledge, Weidlinger has been added to our research team to provide analytical predictions for gray cast iron response to such loading.  Due to the variability of behavior of brittle cast iron, it is crucial to procure the brittle cast iron material that has material properties matching those Weidlinger has been using in high-order calculations.  <BR> <BR>Weidlinger has proved in their past research effort that they have an understanding of the materials behavior and can also successfully model this behavior in order to predict reasonable results in their simulations.  The material was produced by the Campbell Foundry Company.  The existing in-depth knowledge and understanding of a specific cast iron, which is cast by Campbell Foundry, is essential to the required timely execution of this DHS-sponsored research project. <BR> <BR>3.  As part of the work for the previous mentioned agencies, Campbell Foundry has fabricated patterns in which 40 degree tunnel sections could be cast to simulate actual sections of the tunnel that is the subject of our concern.  These patterns were used when Campbell Foundry cast tunnel sections for the TSWG research effort.  ERDC-GSL plans to simulate a terrorist attack on a full scale tunnel section.  In order to utilize the pattern already fabricated by Campbell Foundry, while also obtaining specimens with very similar mechanical properties, it is imperative that the tunnel sections be cast by Campbell Foundry Company.  In order to maintain consistency in the experimental results exchange between government agencies, it is critical to procure this material that has been tested experimentally in the past.  Consistency in the manufacturing process from experiment to experiment is critical to the success of the overall research programs within different government agencies.  In order to ensure this consistency, it is imperative that Campbell Foundry Company supplies the cast iron for our research effort as well.

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

The response shall consist of two (2) separate parts; Part I - Price Proposal, and PART II- TECHNICAL DATA AND INFORMATION, PART III- PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION .</p>
<p>b. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.</p>
<p>c. Specific Instructions:</p>
<p>1. PART I - PRICE - Submit original and one (1) copy</p>
<p>a. Complete blocks 12, 17a, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 30(a) (b) and (c) of the SF1449. In doing so, the offeror accedes to the contract terms and conditions as written in the SOLICITATION, with attachments. The SOLICITATION constitutes the model contract.</p>
<p>b. Insert proposed UNIT and EXTENDED prices in the Pricing Schedule.

In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as cost overruns, extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc.</p>
<p>(b) Past Performance Information: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Provide a list of no more than five (5) references of the most relevant contracts performed for commercial customers, Federal agencies, or other military organizations that have used, or are currently using the same or similar service proposed for this contract.

<p>If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, identify the work the subcontractor will be performing if you are relying on the subcontractor's past performance</p>
<p>(c) Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor.</p>
<p>The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. The evaluation process will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106 using the following process. The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate approximately 2-3 of the lowest priced quotes for technical acceptability, if applicable, and price reasonableness starting with the lowest priced offer. If none of the three lowest priced offers are found to be acceptable, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated, and the process will continue until 2 or more offers are found to be technically acceptable. If after reviewing all offers, only one is found to be technically acceptable, the contractor may be requireed to ask the offeror to supply more information to make a price fair and reasonable determination. Offers will receive a technical rating of either acceptable or non-acceptable. <br />Step 3. Assess performance confidence for 2-3 of the lowest priced technically acceptable offerors utilizing performance information provided by the contractor, performance questionaires, PPRIRS, or any other reasonable basis. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances contracts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. <br /><br />d. A technical review will be accomplished on all offer: a) to ensure offered product meets all product specifications and requirements of the solicitation b) to ensure products will meet the compatibility needs of the governments, and c) to assess quality of offered products. Offers will receive a technical rating of either ACCEPTABLE or NON-ACCEPTABLE.</p>
<p>e. The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>f. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>k. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest of the government. <br />(End of Addendum)</p>

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support. This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

<POPADDRESS>The actual survey sites are situated at specified Forest Recreation Sites or other locations on or near the National Forest.  Maps will be included to show the location of each survey site. 

Accessibility by motor vehicle is generally good.  All survey sites are reached by graded roads at a minimum, and paved roads in some cases.  Weather and wet road conditions could make access difficult in some of the more remote locations. 

The Sawtooth National Forest has several geographically isolated divisions on the South End and remote locations on the North End.  The Snake River Plain separates the northern and southern portions of the Forest.  This is important to consider when multiple surveys are planned for the same day.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that travel time and set up times are accounted for when multiple surveys are required in one day.

<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519, with the exception of Information Technology Value Added Resellers, with a size standard of 150 employees. This acquisition cannot be conducted as a small business set aside because there is no U.S. Small Business Administration waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 541519.

<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.219-28; 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33.

This announcement is the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HC1047-10-T-4002 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-37 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Document Change Notice (DCN) current to 20091123. The associated North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430 with an associated small business size standard of 100. This requirement is being set-aside for small business concerns.&nbsp; New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products, and no "grey market". Offerors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only qualified offerors may submit quotes. This acquisition is firm-fixed-price and solicited on a Brand Name basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. Configuration and compatibility issues justify the use of brand names. Quotes must address whether each contract line item number (CLIN) price proposed by the offeror is based upon open market pricing, or use of an existing vehicle such as GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing, NASA SEWP pricing, etc. If individual CLIN pricing is not on an open market basis, offerors should also include the contract number on which pricing is based as part of their quote for each CLIN. This is an all-or-none requirement. Partial quotes will be deemed unresponsive and will not be evaluated. The Government will award a single purchase order to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the requirements as stated in this synopsis and is most advantageous to the Government based on the lowest price.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>

<p>B) Pursuant to Department of Commerce Clause 1352.215-73 Inquires - All response to questions will be made in writing and included in an amendment to the solicitation. There were three contractors that asked the following questions. The government provided the responses. The government will not address any more questions. If you have submitted a quote and this amendment impacts your quote and new quote can be issued.</p>
<p>Contractor One <br />1. Number two of the tasks mentions a "batch process to build static HTML pages." I need to understand what they mean by "batch process." Do they mean some sort of tool that generates web pages automatically or some similar sort of tool?</p>
<p>2. With the examples 1-9; we are unable to see these pages in order to make any sort of recommendations.<br />3. Is this an ongoing effort?</p>
<p>Contractor Two<br />1. Please provide more detail on the scope of design consultation required for Tasks 2 and 4.</p>
<p>2. Does the scope of work for task 2 involve designing/coding the batch process?</p>
<p>3. Is the scope of work for task 2 limited to SEO consulting to the team preparing the batch process so that the pages produced by the batch process are search engine friendly and optimized?</p>
<p>4. Does the scope of work for task 4 involve designing/coding the revised format for the compound level WTT pages?</p>
<p>5. Is the scope of work for task 4 limited to SEO consulting to the team preparing the revised format for the compound level WTT pages so that the pages are search engine friendly and optimized?</p>
<p>6. What is the expected length for the monthly meetings?</p>
<p>7. Who are the expected attendees for the monthly meetings?</p>
<p>8. Are the meeting to accomplish more that provide a form for status updates and recommendations? If so please describe the additional goals for the meeting?</p>
<p>9. Can the monthly meetings be held via telephone conference?</p>
<p>10. Are the monthly meetings required to be attended in person?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contractor Three<br />. What specific database are you using to host the WTT data and what process or software are you currently using to export the data and create the HTML pages?<br />. The RFQ mentions two different design consultations. Can you define what the outcomes of a design consultation would be? For example, would the outcome be a working template, a document that outlines best practices or something else entirely?<br />. Is there an incumbent currently performing the work, and if so, who is it?</p>
<p>Response One <br />(1) A good definition of "batch process" is given at http://www.answers.com/topic/batch-processing The contractor would lead the design of functionality that would need to be maintainable by TRC developers and is customized for TRC's actual technical environment. TRC's technical environment can be briefly described as follows: This is a Linux server environment in which we use Perl, PHP, Java and Javascript to develop and publish web pages using Apache and Tomcat. Web pages are dynamically generated and access Oracle databases. <br />(2) The Web pages in question are all located within nist.gov Web space. All are publicly available and can be located by any search engine.<br />(3) The SEO project is not likely to become an ongoing effort. It should be concluded in calendar year 2010.</p>
<p>Response Two <br />(1) TRC's technical development environment can de described as follows: This is a Linux server environment in which we use Perl, PHP, Java and Javascript to develop and publish web pages using Apache and Tomcat. Web pages are dynamically generated and access Oracle databases.<br />(2) to (5) The questions related to Tasks 2 and 4 in the RFQ can be broken into 3 parts: <br />a. "Do I need to code?" No programming is required.<br />b. "Can I provide general SEO design consultation or does it need to be customized for TRC's actual technical environment?" The SEO design will be customized for TRC's actual technical environment.<br />c. "Can you be more explicit about what 'design' means here?" In this context, design means to lead the design effort in consultation with TRC Group staff, through email, phone calls and monthly meetings. During monthly meetings TRC Group design requirements will be discussed in detail. The contractor will actively participate in these meetings to provide an SEO design which is customized for the environment and provides sufficient detail that TRC staff will use to proceed with development.<br />(6) 30 to 60 min<br />(7) contractor plus 3 or 4 NIST employees<br />(8) The monthly meetings provide a forum for detailed discussions of the project.<br />(9) yes<br />(10) no</p>
<p>Response Three</p>
<p>(1) TRC's technical development environment can de described as follows: This is a Linux server environment in which we use Perl, PHP, Java and Javascript to develop and publish web pages using Apache and Tomcat. Web pages are dynamically generated and access Oracle databases.<br />(2) Tasks 2 and 4 in the RFQ mention design consultations. The following describes the outcomes:<br />a. No programming is required.<br />b. The SEO design will be customized for TRC's actual technical environment.<br />c. In this context, "design" means to lead the design effort in consultation with TRC Group staff. Communications will be through email, phone calls and monthly meetings. During monthly meetings TRC Group design requirements will be discussed in detail. The contractor will actively participate in these meetings to provide an SEO design which is customized for the environment and provides sufficient detail that TRC staff will use to proceed with development.<br />(3) There is no incumbent doing SEO for TRC Group at this time; a conceptual study was included as a small part of a study completed by Mr. Brendan Watt in 2009</p>

<DESC>The following information was provided by ATSC for help with providing a cost estimate:<BR><BR>1.  The average weight of an outbound box is between 30 -35 lbs. per full box.  Some are partials, which would be put in smaller boxes.<BR><BR>2.  The number of different materials (SKUs) the average outbound box contains are typically 1 item per box.  Usually first or last box is where we even out the number requested if it does not require an even number of boxes.  In shipping more than 1 product per order, 1st or last would be the mixed box with more than 1 item in it.<BR><BR>3.  The average daily volume of outbound metered mail fluctuates according to how much is going mail as opposed to fed-x/u.p.s. and how much is going overseas.  Last month, through a meter we averaged approximately 70 pieces per day. <BR><BR>4.  The average total number of individual items (SKUs) that are stored and shipped from the warehouse at a given time is between 1500 and 1600 items stored, with the large majority of that being actively shipped.<BR><BR>5.  The cost of shipping and mailing of training materials is incurred by the government i.e. charged to a government account.<BR><BR>6.  The number of boxes per year of 25,000 is indicated in the solicitation.  The volume of inserting revised or new instruction material into packages would be approximately 1/3 of those products.  Only a couple of products have revised or new instruction materials that we insert into the packages.<BR><BR>7.  Vendor will provide racking/storage containers.<BR><BR>8.  The incumbent is Wright Engineering, currently performing the work on post.  There are 8 contractors currently working.<BR><BR>9.  A site visit is not in the current plans.  We are just trying to gather data.  Any decisions on whether this work will be moved off-site or not have not been made.<BR><BR>10.  The government provided inventory software is IDMS (internal inventory software).  Requisitions and shipping requests are transmitted electronically to the warehouse/contractor.<BR>  <BR>

<DESC>Description:

The U.S. Department of State (DoS) intends to conduct a competitive procurement for a contractor(s) to provide construction security monitoring services at overseas and domestic Department of State (DoS) construction sites and storage areas.  DoS requires Site Security Personnel (SSP) support services at various domestic and overseas facilities to detect unauthorized access to internal controlled areas, to deter the introduction of unauthorized materials to the site, and to surveil the activities of un-cleared construction workers to prevent the implantation of clandestine surveillance devices or systems into the structure being constructed or its surroundings.  Four types of SSP may be required: 1) Cleared American Guards (CAG), 2) Construction Surveillance Technicians (CST), 3) Team Leaders, and 4) Site Security Coordinators (SSC).  There is currently no known requirement for construction security monitoring services at any domestic locations.  However, if a domestic need for these services should arise, DoS may also acquire the necessary services under this contract through issuance of delivery/task orders, which will specify locations and will include any provision and/or instructions applicable to work within the United States.

DoS plans to award multiple Labor-Hour, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for base and (4) four one-year option years. The IDIQ awards will be made to the responsive offerors, whose proposals conform to the solicitation, and will offer the Best Value to the government, whereas technical factors are more important than cost.  One award will be set aside for small business should a small business be found capable.  To qualify as a small business under the NAICS code, 561612, the small business size is the average annual receipts of no more than $18.5M.

The Request for Solicitation and its attached documents will be posted under Solicitation Number, SAQMMA10R0022, on or around January 21, 2010.  Proposal submissions will be due no later than 3:00 PM, EST on February 23, 2010.

Security Clearance Requirements:

Offerors must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Top Secret facility clearance (FCL), issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M.  All entities comprising a joint venture for this effort must already possess a TS FCL, as well as the joint venture.  Successful offerors shall assign only U.S. citizens who possess current final Top Secret personnel security clearances for performance as Site Security Personnel on this contract.  Certain domestic management personnel must possess DSS Secret personnel security clearances.

DOS will not sponsor any firm for a facility clearance or facility clearance upgrade from Secret to Top Secret for this solicitation due to time constraints.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.  A bidders DD Form 254 has been issued with this solicitation.

The contract addressed by this notice will provide service in the Russian Federation. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and professional qualifications for the required work.   The contract will consist of five ordering periods, one base year plus four 1-year options, for a total of five years maximum.   The Government anticipates the award of one contract for this requirement.  The Government further anticipates a contract capacity of approximately $1M to $50M  .

It is the Governments intent to consider awarding a portion of this acquisition to small businesses.  As a result, the Government is performing market research in order to determine if small businesses possess the capability to execute some or all of the requirements within this acquisition. Respondents need to indicate all small business set-aside designations (small business, 8(a), certified HUBZone and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned). <BR><BR>All interested firms who meet the capability requirements identified in this notice are requested to reply to this e-mail with a response to the questions presented below.  If no experience or capabilities are associated with a particular question, so indicate.  Based upon small business responses received, consideration will be given to defining what part of the acquisition, if any, will be set-aside for small business competition.<BR> <BR>2. PROJECT INFORMATION <BR><BR>The Russian Federation (RF) began CWDF chemical agent destruction operations at the Shchuchye CWDF in March 2009.  The U.S. Government (USG) is presently performing trilateral contract verification and payment for completed work and technical support with the authorization of the RF to assure continued operations as the RF systemizes the facility during hot operations.  During facility systemization and subsequent initial start up, technical issues may arise that will require resolution in a prompt and timely manner. The issues may relate to equipment malfunctions, failures, request for additional spare parts, or other technical issues relating to bringing the facility to full operations.  This technical support is also expected to productively address potential problems and reduce operational risk.  Anyone may identify an issue, but the RF must request support for the item to be managed as follows:<BR>a. Identification of Issue:  The RF identifies a technical issue and conveys it the contractor.  The issue may initially be conveyed verbally, telephonically, by email, or by a formal letter requesting assistance in resolving a technical issue.<BR>b. Tracking:  Create a tracking item for the newly identified technical issue immediately after a preliminary verification and assessment of the technical request. <BR>c. Inspection: The contractor shall review the technical issue, obtain additional information from the site, if necessary prepare a report and convey to all the members of the team, detailed information regarding the technical issue. <BR>d. US Government Notification:  The contractor and USG will meet to assess the available information and reach agreement on the path forward.  Based on the urgency of the need and the number of ongoing issues, this meeting may be held daily or on an as needed basis. The latest update on each issue will be provided during the meeting and any change in the current path forward, if needed, will also be determined during these meetings.  The USG shall provide concurrence for use of USG funds for the item created prior to proceeding with further action.<BR>e. Vendor Support: If it becomes evident that outside vendor support will be needed to resolve the technical issue, the contractor will initiate discussions with the vendor. These initial discussions will ensure that the vendor fully understands the issues needing resolution and, if needed, a suitable specialist comes to the site fully prepared to work on the issue. <BR>f. Procurement:  Based on the recommendations of the team, should a procurement action result, the contractor will initiate the procurement and follow the procurement action through until the action is satisfactorily completed.<BR><BR>Subject to funding constraints, the USG is continuing to provide verification and payment actions for RF awarded trilateral government contracts.  This support involves establishing a subcontract relationship with a Russian contractor who will act as an agent and sign RF awarded trilateral government contracts as the Payer.  This sub-contractor will receive invoices from the RF for completed work, verify their accuracy and pass them to the USG contractor for verification of work and payment.  The USG contractor will physically verify the completed work and provide payment for the invoice through their subcontractor Russian agent.<BR><BR>3. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS<BR>The decision to reserve award(s) for qualified small business under a single award acquisition is being considered pending the evaluation of responses to this sources sought announcement.

<DESC>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) created a Federal Coordinating Council (FCC) for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) and charged it with developing recommendations on how t invest funding appropriated to the Secretary for comaprative effectiveness research.  The Council recommended, and the Secretary agreed, that a robust longitudinal claims infrastructure to support CER was critical.

There exist a number of databases with longitudinal claims data that could facilitate analysis of such data for CER purposes.  Each, however, has limitations in its application to CER.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Integrated Data Repository (IDR), Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW), and Medicaid cliaims files (MAX) databases include data only on the Medicare and Medicaid populations; state-based all-payor, all-claims databases are limited geographically in scope and by variability in infrastructure design and state capabiliity; private databases may include information on a more demographically diverse population, but are still fragmented and often accessible to researchers due to cost.

An all-payor, all-claims database would allow for greater power in analysis, ensuring taht the data infrastructure the Secretary supports will be able to produce robust analysis.  If developed well, this database would be a representative sample of the population and could be built upon over time.  The public commentary at FCC listening sessions affirmed the value of an all-payor, all-claims database.  Claims data, especially if established in a manner where it can be linked to other data over time, can be a powerful tool for CEr and ultimately improve care for all Americans.

Given the breadth of potential options for building an all-payor, all-claims database and the significant investment required to do so successfully, the awarded contract is for a targeted design study to inform the creation of such a database and supporting services, methods, and skills.  Additionally, the awardee may be involved in supporting tranistion to an implementation of such a database under the contract.

The period of performance is for 12 months.

<AWARDEE>CANNON WATER SUPPLY DISTRICT 1 (156339582)<br> 126 E MAIN ST<br> PERRY, MO 63462-1114
<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source as this contract is for utilities, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>This action is necessitated to provide year round fire flow capacity for the M.W. Boudreaux Memorial Visitor Center currently under construction. It is necessary to modify the Ray Behrens Elevated Tank in order to overcome the low water usage typically experienced throughout the cooler months. During these cooler conditions, the water becomes stagnant, loses chlorine residual, and becomes susceptible to freezing, resulting in water unsafe for consumption, and ice build up potentially damaging to the tank.  To avoid theses circumstances the Water District removes the tank from service throughout the cooler months. In order to overcome the issue of low water usage with seasonal outages, the Ray Behrens Elevated Tank must be modified to provide year round flow capacity. Contract is for construction of a part of a utility system and the utility company itself is the only source capable to work on the system.

<DESC>(Subject Continued)  COOSA PROJECT, TUSCALOOSA, AL<br><br>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D MAINTENANCE, W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor is already in the midst of the job and this modification is to add funding needed to complete the job as a result of the failure of government-owned equipment and a flood event.  2)  The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs to de-water the structures.  3) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  4)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Miter gates weighing up to 365 tons may require disconnection from anchorage and jacking for repair.  Miter gates may also require specialized alignment for positioning; removal and installation of contact blocks; stressing of steel diagonals; and line bores of up to 13 inch diameter for gudgeon and anchor pin replacement.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN
FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


I.	CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION

The contracting organization that is responsible for the proposed contract action is the Directorate of Contracting, AFFTC/PKEE, 5 South Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB, California.  The purchase request number for this action is F1S0AE9072B001, and the Contracting Officer for this acquisition is Mike Keeling.

II.	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED

The proposed contract action will be awarded as a sole-source, firm-fixed price contract.  The proposed source is:

	Spearhead 2 of the Abraham Y Goldratt Institute LP
	442 Orange Street
	New Haven, CT 06511-6201

III.	DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCYS NEEDS

This is for the acquisition of the Theory of Constraints (TOC) - Project Management (PM), Technical Expert (TE), Master Trainer courses, Train the Trainer, Train the Trainer certification and other training course materials- specifically geared to teach TOC PM Critical Chain methodology and Root Cause Analysis at Edwards AFB.  It will be a one-year, firm-fixed price contract, with an estimated value of $149,000.00.

The contractor shall educate, prepare, and certify local staff as master trainers. Certified master trainers will have the ability to teach local TOC classes.  The government reserves the right to assign specific course modules those individuals will be certified to instruct.  The contractor shall use practical examples that the master trainers may encounter locally.  The contractor shall provide courses that, at a minimum, enable the trainer to transfer essential knowledge of TOC multi-project management to students, such as: construction of project networks, scheduling individual projects, synchronizing multiple projects, project budgeting, operational management to include buffer management, and resource utilization, resource assignment to tasks, behaviors/roles/responsibilities, metrics and implementation roadmaps.   

In addition, the contractor shall also provide Master Trainer candidates with skills and certification necessary to transfer AGIs TOC project management/technical expert program.  This contract will provide for the use of AGI licensed training materials from December 2009 through December 2010.  The following is a summary of this contracts requirements:

IV.	STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

10 USC	 2304(c), as implemented by FAR 6.302 (FAR 6.303-1(a) (2).

V.	 DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

The primary purpose of this follow-on contract action is to continue to provide Theory of Constraints Project Management (TOC PM) training, training materials, and train-the-trainer certifications to meet the Test Wings requirements for a standardized project management methodology across the Test and Evaluation (T&E) enterprise.  As part of the existing (current) and previous contracts with AGI, specific training courses were developed by the contractor for the government to use with government trainers in order to reduce cost of training the Edwards project management community and provide greater scheduling flexibility and throughput.  

AGI has developed specialized/in-depth course materials and resources for use during Technical Expert, Master Trainer and Deployment Expert (DE) Training/Certification. Six main areas where in-depth knowledge is transferred to students who in turn utilize the knowledge to facilitate project management activities are: 

a.	Deepening understanding of the solution

b.	Skills for Customization of the Solution

c.	Defining implementation

d.	Skills for customizing the implementation

e.	Sills for resolving conflicts

AGI is the sole owner of the current proprietary course material tailored to AFFTC requirements, and has requisite knowledge in those areas for the past seven years.  AGI Licensee Agreement containing all Ownership term and conditions is shown at [Attachment A] to this justification.
 
Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition over this limited period of performance. Furthermore, there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Forces requirements, as discussed below.

In 2001 the 412 TW chose Theory of Constraints Project Management (TOC PM), Critical Chain methodology as their standardized project management process through a competitive Best Value source selection. Changing from the chosen methodology and redirecting to another contractor now would result in substantial duplication of cost due to duplicative costs of creating new TOC course materials.  To a lesser extent, there would also be retraining expense in transitioning to different course materials.  This is because another firm will likely have a differing approach to applying TOC PM and Critical Chain methodology to our environment.  For a time, additional trainers would be needed to accommodate increased training requirements and ensure a cadre of certified instructors is readily available to meet organizational training needs. 

Current Critical Chain, Theory of Constraints Project Management methodology deployment efforts to-date has cost the 412TW and AFFTC $6.9M. Current in-house capabilities to teach Technical Expert training results in an annual minimum savings of $450K per year based on five courses with 10 students each at $1K per class versus $10K per class.  This is why the anticipated cost of an additional year using AGI courses and materials is only $149,000.  From discussions with industry, AFFTC does not find it likely that another firm could perform for 12 months as economically as AGI.  A newcomer would need to develop new materials for multiple offerings, train AF trainers on the new materials and conduct advanced training.  A competitor would face quite a task to pursue this additional effort for a profit at AGIs one-year cost of providing existing courses and materials.  

In addition to the duplicative development and training cost, there is also the aspect of unacceptable delays in fulfilling the 412TW requirements.  412TW conducted market research via sources sought synopsis in FedBizOpps.  As one would expect, none of the responding firms indicated that they have already developed  specialized, tailored training materials to meet the 412TW requirements. The responding firms would be unable to accomplish this task, given the opportunity, in the allotted timeframe to satisfy the current years training requirements previously scheduled.  It is estimated that any firm would have to devote a minimum of four (4) to six (6) months to begin what  has taken AGI several years to develop.  The 412TW TOC training requirements begin in Oct 09.  Thus, awarding to any other firm than AGI would delay our training schedule by at least four (4) to six (6) months. This delay would severely impact project management on the Global Reach, Global Vigilance, Global Power Fighters, Global Power Bombers, F-22 and Test Operations currently under the purview of the 412TW, causing test mission delays and possible delays in deployment of systems to the war fighter.            

Therefore, this acquisition is for continued performance of a highly specialized service.

PREVIOUS ACQUISITION:  FA9302-07-P-M035, 3 Apr 07 (Master Trainer Course); FA9302-07-P-E175, 29 Sep 07 (License Agreement); FA9302-08-M-F158, 12 Sep 08 (License Use of AGI Materials); FA9302-08-M-M038, 22 Sep 08 (TOC Master Trainer Course).

VI.	 DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE

A sources sought synopsis was issued on 14 August 2009 for 14 days.  The results were responses from 2 (two) different firms, SabiOso, a registered small disadvantaged business, and Advanced Projects, Inc., a registered SBA certified Hub Zone firm.  An amended sources sought was posted 16 September 2009 for 9 days.  The amended sources sought was extended on 22 September to 28 September 2009 at the request of Larry Leach, Advanced Projects, Inc. The results were responses from 3 (three) different firms, Promontory Management Group, a registered small business located in Layton, Utah,  Advanced Projects, Inc a Hub Zone small business, and APICS North Texas, a non-profit organization. 

A review of the qualifications of the above mentioned respondents was conducted, and it was determined that none of the above firms were  capable of providing the required specific training, that which is TOC PM training tailored to 412 TW, in the allotted timeframe previously discussed.  Further, because of the proprietary nature of  AGI owned standardized project management process, it is not feasible at this time for another firm to use the existing training materials as a stopgap.  Since none of the respondents to the sources sought have the approval from AGI to teach AGIs standardized project management processes, then changing to a different project management process, would force the 412TW to incur substantial duplicative cost and unacceptably long mission delays.  All respondents were informed of the results of the Government evaluation. 

A notice of contract action (NOCA) will be issued indicating that the Government intends to award a contract to AGI, under Other Than Full and Open Competition.  

VII.	DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICE THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE

The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable, based on price analysis for commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 15.404-1(b) and FAR 13.106-3.  



VIII.DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED

See Section VI.



IX.	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

None

X.	LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION

See Section VI.

XI.	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED

Within one year, a future acquisition for this requirement is anticipated, and the government intends to re-compete this requirement with full and open competition by conducting a complete source selection process. Acquiring the training and materials, over a longer performance period, should make competition more feasible.  Competitors will have greater time to offset the development costs by submitting proposals that provide longer-term savings.  The government intends to solicit firms with sufficient advance notice so that industry has a four (4) to six (6) months lead time in competing for this effort.   Likewise, the government anticipates negotiating Government Purpose Rights to eliminate any barriers to competition.   


XII.	 CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION

The contracting officers signature on the Justification Review Document evidences that officer has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of officers knowledge and believed to be in accordance with FAR 6.303-2(a) (12).

XIII.	TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION

As evidenced by their signatures on the Justification Review Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete. [FAR 6.303-2(b)].
