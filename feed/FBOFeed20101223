<SUBJECT>Bi-Parting Empennage Enclosure for C-5
<SOLNBR>MTE-1 
<CONTACT>Richard E. Belford Jr., Contracting Officer, Email Richard.Belford.1@us.af.mil
<DESC><br />Pre-Solcitiation Description for Mobile Tail Enclosure - Westover Air Reserve Base, Massachusetts<br />This requirement is to furnish and install all fabrication, labor, travel, equipment, materials, training, and other items as required herein and as necessary to provide complete a functioning C-5 Bi-Parting Empennage Enclosure for Westover ARB, MA. System to be provided shall be classified as equipment and will connect to a hangar during use.
<p>The mobile enclosure shall be a bi-parting enclosure, consisting of two self-supporting, three-sided, roofed structures mounted on a dual flanged steel wheel and rail track system and be fully self-propelled to open and close around the C-5 empennage. The structure shall be stable, rigid, and sway-resistant in any position. Fabric structures are not allowed. The length of travel of each section of the enclosure to the fully opened mode shall be at least half the full wing span of the aircraft and beyond the minimum wing tip clearance requirements for safe movement of aircraft into and out of the ISO dock.</p>
<p>When in closed mode the enclosure shall be sized to completely enclose the aircraft's empennage and maintenance tail stand with a minimum interior clearance of 10 feet (15 feet is desirable) at all points on each side of the tail stand; a minimum interior clearance of 25 feet to the rear of the tail stand; and the minimum interior clearance necessary for the safe operation of the jib crane.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  The FAA has a future requirement to provide Security Officer Services on a national contract level.  The FAA performance area is the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and specific U.S. Territories.  The period of performance is forecast to begin approximately March 31, 2012.  Interested sources that are capable of providing both armed and unarmed Security Officer Services in accordance with the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) should respond.
The nature of the competition has not been determined.  It may be necessary for the FAA to issue a short-term bridge contract (12-18 months) so that all security support requirements are met while the Government completes the competitive process.  The bridge contract will be executed in accordance with FAA AMS Policy and Guidance.  The FAA will evaluate the responses to this Market Survey and will make acquisition decisions based on those responses.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services, with a size standard of $17 Million.
The FAA encourages the use of the FAA Mentor Protg Program for this requirement.  Information on the FAA Mentor Protg Program can be found on the FAA Small Business website at www.sbo.faa.gov through the Contracting tab.
All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 15 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  
PURPOSE:This market survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  This is neither a screening information request (SIR) nor request for proposal (RFP) of any kind.  The FAA will not accept unsolicited proposals.  The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
CAPABILITY STATEMENT:
All responders must provide a Capability Statement that addresses the following minimum criteria (in order):
a.	The potential Offeror's primary business must be providing contract security officer services, including armed security officers.
b.	The prime potential Offeror must have at least five (5) years of documented experience in providing contract armed security service officer services.
c.	The potential Offeror must demonstrate they have provided satisfactory service to large facilities similar to FAA large manned facilities.  This includes operation of automated access control, visual surveillance, intrusion detection and X-Ray scanning equipment.
d.	The potential Offeror must provide proof that they and all of their personnel assigned to FAA facilities, are capable of meeting all applicable federal, state and local license and registration requirements, and that all required registrations and licenses are current at the time of award.  Successful Offerors must maintain currency for all required registrations and licensing throughout the contract period of performance.
e.	Identify any restrictions in providing security officer services geographically.  For example if you cannot provide security officers for Alaska, Hawaii and Guam, identify those areas.  If you can only provide security officers for one state or FAA Service Area (see attached map) then note that.
f.	Identify the type of security officer services provided by your firm (Armed/Unarmed).
REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST:
Interested vendors must provide the following:
a.	Capability Statement (as defined above)
b.	Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)
c.	Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form and/or proof of service-disabled veteran-owned small business status (if applicable)

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for the release of solicitation HQ0147-10-R-0018 for the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Objective Simulation Framework (OSF). The MDA intends to issue the solicitation after January 10, 2011 for the development, deployment and sustainment of an OSF Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) framework that leverages existing or mature capabilities and develops a single system to replace the existing digital (Digital Simulation Architecture [DSA]) and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) (Single Stimulation Framework [SSF]) systems with a modular, scalable, reconfigurable, and composeable architecture. This acquisition also requires the sustainment of the legacy framework/architecture until OSF is deployed; along with other requirements that will be further detailed within the Request for Proposal (RFP) package.
<p>MDA anticipates the award of a single OSF Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Cost Plus Incentive Fee, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Fixed Priced Incentive (Firm Target) and Firm Fixed Price CLINs to occur by June 2011. The contract is expected to have a five (5) year period of performance without any option periods. The solicitation will be awarded in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 on a full and open competitive basis. MDA intends to award to a single offeror on a "best value" basis to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. Evaluation factors to be used by the Government to establish the "best value" decision will be technical, management, past performance and cost/price in that order of significance.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor may propose as a prime contractor and/or participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams). The Government does not intend to impose restrictions on team membership after award, except as necessary to prevent Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) issues between this requirement and advisory and assistance contracts supporting the MDA/DES Model and Simulation Directorate and their OSF Program Management Office (See RFP Clause H-09 Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)(MAY 2005)). Note: In order to be considered for award, contractor personnel and contractor facilities must be cleared at the SECRET level.</p>
<p>An Offeror's Library for this acquisition has been established and contains both classified and export-controlled data. Access to the information contained in the Offeror's Library will be restricted to personnel who have been pre-cleared by MDA contracting and security officials. The Offeror's Library may be accessed by submitting the attached Offeror's Library request forms (Attachment L-1 OSF Offeror's Library Request Form-Unclassified, and Attachment L-1a OSF Offeror's Library Request Form-Classified).</p>
<p>The release of this synopsis and issuance of the RFP, when posted, is NOT a commitment by the Government to award a contract. The Government will NOT pay any costs incurred by a potential Offeror as a result of the posting of this synopsis or the release of the RFP, when posted.</p>
<p>Industry is reminded that interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive email notification when information, solicitation and any amendments or future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and available for downloading. MDA will not directly send offerors the solicitation or any amendments. It is the interested offeror's responsibility to periodically check this website for updates.</p>
<p>Request that all interested parties update the 'Interested Vendors List" and provide the name, e-mail address and phone number of the point of contact or contacts within your organization. In addition; please provide an e-mail notification containing the same information to OSFCompetition@mda.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with GE Aviation Systems Limited, for the procurement of fifty three (53) sets (one hundred six (106) each) of Part number 53100101, V-22 Optical Blade Tracker Assembly.  These assemblies will be used at the Organizational Level of Maintenance to automatically measure the track of each proprotor blade on the V-22 aircraft, record vibrations, track data, and identify the required adjustments.  

The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1.  The Government does not possess the drawings or technical data for the Optical Blade Tracker Assembly to permit full and open competition.  GE Aviation, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of this Assembly owns the technical data and engineering drawings and all rights to this information.  They are unwilling to sell this information or any data rights to the Government.  Without that information, the Government is unable to organically design or solicit an Optical Blade Tracker Assembly with the proper interfaces that are required to ensure compatibility between the Assembly and the OBT end product.  The Government intends to purchase these assemblies directly from the OEM.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract.  The point of contact is Ms. Melissa Bucci, melissa.bucci@navy.mil.  See numbered notes 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate a contract with National Conference of State Legislatures located in Denver, CO on a sole source basis for the Administration of Children and Families (ACF)/Office of Child Support Enforcement's&nbsp;"Child Support Enforcement State Legislature Support Project."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The acquisition is for a one year base period and includes a one year option period. <br /></span><strong><br />Purpose</strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"> - The success of the federal Child Support Enforcement Program (e.g., ensuring that children receive financial support from their noncustodial parents) is contingent, in part, on the ability of state legislatures to establish correlating laws, policies, and procedures and to appropriate funds that adhere to the federal program financial matching requirements.<br /></span><br />
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">These responsibilities are being made more difficult for state legislatures in view of the current downturn in the economy, increasing state budget deficits, and the fact that nearly &frac14; of the state legislators elected in November, 2010 are new.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) reauthorization, pending congressional action in the near future, will likely contain amendments to the child support enforcement program that will require legislatures to propose, review and approve implementing state legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">It is in the best interest of the federal Child Support Enforcement program that state legislatures remain informed on current national issues, federal and key interstate laws, and changing program policies so that child support agencies can build and maintain an infrastructure that ensures federal policies are implemented and programs perform, as required, to meet the needs of parents and children.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The purpose of the proposed acquisition will enable the federal government to ensure child support policies are properly implemented at the state level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the official representative of the nation's 7,382 state legislators and their staff and can serve federal child support interests through the: 1) Establishment of a Child Support Clearinghouse and by providing Technical Assistance to States' Legislatures (and their staff); and 2)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Convening a National State Legislative Symposium on Child Support Enforcement in order to provide state legislators with the opportunity to meet and work with senior state and federal officials on key child support issues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong> - The need to assist state legislatures with the immediate challenges before them (both fiscal and programmatic) as they relate to the continued viability of state child support enforcement programs can be best expedited through the bi-partisan National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) which has been designated by the Internal Revenue Service as an instrumentality of the fifty states.</p>
<p>This organization represents and is comprised of the nation's 7,382 state legislators and their staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, NCSL's organizational structure has been built upon the need to provide information, guidance, and expert technical assistance to state legislators in order to ensure their awareness of public policy and state and federal statutory and program mandates.</p>
<p>NCSL is the organization which exists to provide technical assistance to state legislatures and legislators in the conduct of their program and policy responsibilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NCSL has the unique in-house staff capability to analyze state law and federal and state policies; the expertise to provide guidance; and the mechanisms in place to disseminate information directly to state legislators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These organizational capabilities are vital to achieving the objectives envisioned for the proposed project.</p>
<p>Since the second objective of this proposed acquisition is to convene a National State Legislative Symposium on Child Support in September, 2011, we find that the NCSL is the sole credible organization that has the ability to meet the needs and interests of the federal government in executing this task in a timely manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And because of its status as an extension of state legislatures, NCSL can ensure the participation of the state legislators in the national symposium in a way that no other organization is able to.</p>
<p>The current economic downturn, rising state budget deficits, pending TANF reauthorization, a large number of recently-elected and new state legislators, and the complexity of other child support program and policy issues necessitate that this project be implemented to meet the critical timing as specified in this proposed acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Approach</strong> -&nbsp;The mechanisms are in place within NCSL's organization to fulfill the requirements of the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; With respect for implementing Task I,&nbsp;</span>NCSL currently provides the nation's 7,382 legislators a full range of services designed to help them confront the problems that matter most to their states and their constituents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NCSL has "State Liaisons" and the nation's best policy experts to provide state legislators and their staff with information on various policy areas that are essential to the child support program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Child support is an issue area that needs to be given more visibility and NCSL will be able to accomplish this objective through this acquisition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>NCSL also sponsors an annual Legislative Summit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the largest and most substantive meeting of its kind in the nation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each year, more than 6,000 state legislators, staff and other interested public policy-makers attend informative sessions on a range of public policy issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through this contract, NCSL will give child support high visibility and prominence at this key annual Summit through the convening of workshops on the topic.</p>
<p>State legislators and legislative staff are also entitled to bill information services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it relates to child support enforcement, this contract will enable NCSL to assist state legislators in various ways including, but not limited to, providing testimony and consulting with legislative committees considering child support law and policy; developing and maintaining a legislative clearinghouse on child support enforcement; and in the provision of on-site and long-distance technical assistance to states.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this task area is of utmost importance since an estimated 25% of the nation's state legislators were newly-elected in November, 2010 and will need to be informed about child support policy, critical funding issues, and the child-support related amendments that might be included in the TANF reauthorization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, legislative term limits and increasing turnover in state legislatures have resulted in a continuing need for education and the provision of reliable information on child support issues by a trusted, non-partisan source.</p>
<p>With respect to implementing Task II: [Convening a] National State Legislative Symposium on Child Support in September, 2011, NCSL will be able to identify state legislators serving key roles on child support matters and/or those who maintain leadership positions on appropriations and/or legislative authorizing committees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NCSL has this information on-hand and once the specific legislators have been identified, an estimated 75 to 85 state legislators across the nation will be invited to participate in the National Symposium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NCSL is the sole organization capable of expediting delivery of this task because of its status as an instrumentality of the fifty states and ensuring the participation of the state legislators in the national symposium in a way that no other organization can approximate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This statement is also based on OCSE's past experience with NCSL when a similar national symposium was held on September 11-13, 2003 -- necessitated at the time with by passage of the landmark 1996 welfare reform legislation.<br /><br />The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing that they can meet the Government's requirement by January 7, 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy the stated requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Responses must be emailed the attention of Camille Timmerman at <a href="mailto:Camille.Timmerman@psc.hhs.gov">Camille.Timmerman@psc.hhs.gov</a>.&nbsp; The Subject Line of the email must reference ACF54775.&nbsp; The </span>Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source award to National Conference of State Legislatures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A determination by the Government not to open the requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No solicitation document is available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this announcement is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

No contract or other instrument will be provided as a result of this request for information and no reimbursement will be provided for any information provided. Therefore, any costs associated with the provided Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the expense of the concern submitting the information. <BR><BR>The overall objective of this program is to develop FMTV engine repair capability at Red River Army Depot (RRAD) and support the future Life Cycle Management for the Caterpillar Models 3116, 3126 and C7 engines using the Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) concept. All work will be performed at RRAD located in Texarkana, TX. The Contractor shall develop a Public-Private Partnership with RRAD in accordance with 10 USC 2474. The Contractor and RRAD shall perform a Pre-Shop Analysis (PSA) on these engines to determine level of repair required to return them to Condition Code "A" (CCA). The engines will be triaged to a rebuild process or a limited repair process according to their condition based on the outcome of the initial PSA.  Caterpillar parts are required to support this effort. The Contractor shall provide the technical expertise, life cycle data management support, supply chain management and data management control as required to support the process, product, data management and reporting requirements under the SOW. <BR><BR>The Contractor and RRAD shall induct and perform CBM on Caterpillar Engine Models C-7, 3116 and 3126 and return them to the customer in a condition code "A" status, which is defined as new, used, repaired, or re-conditioned material that is serviceable and issuable to all customers without limitation or restriction. The Contractor/RRAD shall provide personnel, supervision, special tools, and parts to meet the requirement of rebuilding Caterpillar Model C-7, 3116 and 3126 Engines. The Government will provide unserviceable cores to contractor for rebuild. The Contractor shall provide supply support that maintains accountability for repair parts and supplies that are required to perform the engine rebuild. The Contractor must have a means to collect data from Electronic Control Module (ECM) for trend management analysis, and zero out the ECM to bring the engine to a zero hour condition. The Contractor/RRAD shall collect and analyze engine data elements off the ECM, update the ECM, and report trends/results back to TACOM in the Contractor's format.<BR> <BR>Unique Identification (UID) marking is required. Condition Code H Engines inducted and normally declared scrap will be utilized as core assets. A PSA will determine disposition of engine processing to include continued processing and returned back to the customer as Condition Code A or determined uneconomical to repair.  The Contractor shall provide a report of engines and major components that would normally be declared scrap or scrapped engines in RRAD's format. This shall include the engine/major components serial number and National Stock Number, the reason for scrap, the scrap rate per engine model and the overall program engine scrap rate. This effort will also include a core reimbursement for all washed out blocks and cam shafts. There is a short block requirement to provide cams and blocks to bring the engine back to a serviceable condition and reduce the scrap rate.<BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that would apply to this potential requirement is 333618. Contact Sammie Hart at Sammie.hart@us.army.mil no later than close of business on 13 January 2011 with responses to this notice.<BR>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT TEXT, N62473-11-R-3006 Posted to FedBizOpps:  23 December 2010 
Title: Architect and Engineering (A&E) services and support for the Marine Corps Facility Condition Inspection Program using BUILDER Engineered Management System (EMS)
Location: Predominantly in the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest Divisionâ€™s Area of Responsibility (AOR), but also Worldwide
Classification Code: C â€“ Architect and Engineering Services
NAICS Code:  541330 â€“ Engineering Services 

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. This is a market research tool to determine the availability of sources prior to issuing the RFP.
 This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  An award will not be made on offers received in response to this notice. The Government is not responsible for the cost associated with any effort expended in responding to this notice.  All small businesses as well as large businesses are encouraged to respond.  Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Notice, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Government's best interest.

The NAICS code for this proposed procurement is 541330 (small business size standard is $4,500,000).
  If the solicitation is issued, the solicitation will consist of a base period and 4 options totaling 5 years of performance. The anticipated total work to be issued over the life of the contract via task orders (base year plus four one-year options) shall not exceed the estimated maximum amount of $15 million.

The successful contractor to any forthcoming solicitation shall provide all labor, management, supervision, tools, materials, and all equipment necessary to perform the services listed below.  The primary area of focus for this contract is the continental United States (CONUS); however, the contract may be used to support the entire NAVFAC LANT AOR, which includes CONUS and outside continental United States (OCONUS), including the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, Western Asia, and South America.
  Additional support may also be provided to Hawaii, the Far East, and Marianas.

Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) has requested the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW), a component command of NAVFAC LANT, to implement and support the BUILDER Engineered Management System (EMS) at various Marine Corps Installations.  This implementation will improve building inspections and facility management business processes. The United States Army Corps of Engineers developed BUILDER EMS, which is a software application for building asset lifecycle management.  The real property building information and more detailed system inventory is modeled and/or collected which identifies building components and their key life-cycle attributes such as age, material, and capacity.
  Based on this data, inspections are then performed on the various components to determine an objective and repeatable Condition Index (CI) measure.  The CI measures the general physical condition of the asset. This process enables the performance of functionality assessments which are used to evaluate user requirement changes, compliance, and obsolescence issues. This provides a comprehensive picture of the overall performance of building assets and their key components.  The BUILDER software uses information about condition, functionality, and remaining service life to assist in the development of short and long range work plans based on sound investment strategies, prioritization criteria, and budget constraints.

The primary tasks anticipated under this contract include support of the Marine Corps Condition Inspection Program including, but not limited to:  BUILDER and other knowledge-based Engineered Management Systems (EMS) facility assessments & training; Specialized Engineering assessments/studies for site facilities (including pavements, structures, roofs); Conventional MO-322- type, deficiency-based facility assessments & training; MAXIMO interface/data interchange; Life-Cycle, Space Utilization and Functionality assessments; Mission Dependency Index (MDI) Surveys;  Construction cost estimates; Budget & parametric cost estimates; Short and Long Range Maintenance Planning (LRMP); Business Case and Economic analysis; Return on Investment (ROI) analysis; Continuous Process Improvement Condition Inspection Program Meetings.


Statement of Capabilities Submittal Requirements:  The Statement of Capability (SOC) will determine the feasibility and/or basis for the Governmentâ€™s decision to proceed with acquisition.
  Interested firms must submit a SOC, which describes, in detail, the firmâ€™s capability of providing these services at the various Marine Bases.

The Government reserves the right to request additional information as needed, from any and all respondents; (8) provide a written statement as to your ability to perform work within the Continental United States (CONUS), outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) or both CONUS and OCONUS.
 

The SOC must be complete and sufficiently detailed to allow for a determination on the firmâ€™s qualifications to perform the defined work.  The SOC must be on 8 by 11-inch standard paper, single spaced, 12 point font minimum and is limited to 20 single sided pages (including all attachments).

<DESC><p>This is a Sole Source combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-46. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 518210 with a small business size standard of $25 million. The period of performance shall be 02/01/2011-09/30/2011.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, intends to procure on a sole source basis Medical Record Chart Abstraction from Inpatient Charts and Out-Patient Charts to be procured from Buccaneer Computer Systems. Buccaneer Computer Systems is the only company able to provide this service due to the fact that this is a continuation of an existing project previously funded through an IAA to Centers for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS), who then contracted to Buccaneer for the work to be performed. The current SOW is a continuation of a previous project (e.g., Assessment of CABG) involving the assessment of infections using claims data. As a result, previous experience with record requests for inpatient and outpatient facility procedures identified under the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) is needed, and vendor must have an individual available with expertise in reviewing and abstracting information from charts when clarification is needed. Buccaneer is the only vendor that has access to the required charts needed for abstraction and has an individual trained to review the hard copy charts, as they have completed Phase 1 of this existing project.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Buccaneer under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the posting of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Maria Shamburger, Procurement and Grants Office, 2920 Brandywine Rd, Atlanta, GA 30341, Reference 2011-93544. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov. The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The following provisions apply to this commercial solicitation: 1. FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding any addenda to the provision. 2. FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, if used, and the specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision. If this provision is not used, describe the evaluation procedures to be used. 3. Offerors are to include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer. 4. FAR clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding any addenda to the clause. 5. FAR clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding which, if any, of the additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to the acquisition. 6. Additional contract requirement(s) or terms and conditions may be required for this acquisition if determined necessary by the contracting officer and consistent with customary commercial practices.</p>
<p><br />If no affirmative responses are received within 5 days, in accordance with FAR 13.406-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Buccaneer as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted. For contractual questions contact Maria Shamburger by email at heg9@cdc.gov.</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).</p>
<p>(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.</p>
<p>(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.</p>
<p>(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.</p>
<p>(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This request for quotes (RFQ) for commercial services is in accordance with FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  It will be the responsibility of the offeror to check the website, http://www.fbo.gov, for the issuance of any amendments to the solicitation. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-47.
<p>This requirement is set aside for small businesses under NAICS code 541612. See attached provisions and clauses. The Government will award a single award, firm fixed price contract. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To be eligible for contract award, an offeror must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and the Online Representations and Certifications Applicatio n (ORCA)</span>.</strong> For instructions on registering with CCR, please see CCR's website at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement &amp; Background: </strong><br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) has a requirement for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of the Vice President for Finance and Administration of the University (VP for Finance and Administration) over the past five years.  USUHS wishes to employ the services of a nationally recognized professional with experience and expertise in finance, budgeting, planning and administration for an academic health center/medical school administration.</p>
<p>The University President established the requirement that each of the University's senior leadership would undergo a comprehensive performance assessment at the completion of their fifth year of service to the University. A comprehensive assessment for the VP for Finance and Administration has not been accomplished to date - only annual self-assessments. The requirement calls for a qualified outside contractor to lead a team of selected members from USUHS in completing  interviews and a comprehensive review of the VP of Finance and Administration's performance against the goals he established and were subsequently approved by the University President. The outside contractor will then provide the final assessment in written and presentation form to the University President.</p>
<p><strong>University Information:</strong><br />Established by U.S. Congress in 1972 under the Department of Defense, this federally funded university educates and trains uniformed services scientists and healthcare practitioners for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, U.S. Public Health Service and the Veterans Administration. The University's F. Edward H&eacute;bert School of Medicine (SOM), the Graduate School of Nursing (GSN), Naval Postgraduate Dental Colleges and the Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute are located on the campus of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda (formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland).  The Air Force Postgraduate Dental College is located in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>Doctoral and master's degrees in the biomedical sciences and public health are awarded by interdisciplinary and department-based graduate programs within the School of Medicine. Program strengths include infectious disease, neuroscience, psychology and preventive medicine research. A large number of graduates are military officers and/or serve the federal biomedical research enterprise. The Graduate School of Nursing offers a Master of Science in Nursing degree in Nurse Anesthesia, Family Nurse Practitioner, Perioperative Clinical Nursing, Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, and a full - and part-time program for a Ph.D. in Nursing Science.  The Naval and Air Force Postgraduate Dental Colleges offer a course of instruction for a Master of Science degree in Oral Biology.  The Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute collaborates with other government facilities, academic institutions, and civilian laboratories in the United States and other countries to research the biological effects of ionizing radiation. In addition, it provides medical training and emergency response to manage incidents related to radiation exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work:</strong><br />The assessment shall be based upon interviews with selected individuals and a review of the VP for Finance and Administration's performance.</p>
<p>The contractor will consult with the President, USU to:</p>
<p>1) Provide a comprehensive 5-year performance review of the Vice President for Finance and Administration.

The evaluation shall cover the following topics: leadership; communication; executive and managerial characteristics and support of University's research, teaching, and professional development of the faculty and staff efforts. The assessment shall also include a comprehensive account of the Vice President's strengths and weaknesses, along with recommendations for improvement in all assessment categories, and an account of how the University has changed under his direction.</p>

<p>This portion shall include a milestone chart depicting each step of the assessment (from award of contract to final completion of assessment), how long each portion will take, and who will be working on each portion.</p>
<p>3.       Past Performance - The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance within the past three (3) years.  Offerors must provide a minimum of three (3) references on work of similar complexity, scope, dollar amount, and type. The references must complete the attached past performance survey and email a copy to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil by noon, January 26, 2010.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure past performance surveys are received by the due date</span>.</strong> Any survey included in the quote package, but not emailed to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil will not be considered.  Offerors may provide additional information to support past performance history, but not in lieu of the past performance surveys required. USUHS reserves the right to contact customer references for additional information.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history. Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a "neutral/unknown" rating for past performance. A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable past performance.

<p>4.       Price - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Offerors must provide a firm fixed price quote</span>.</strong> For price analysis purposes only, offeror shall provide a detailed break-down of the hourly rates, the number of anticipated hours per position, and travel expenses.

<p><br /><strong>Funds Availability: </strong> FAR Part 52.232-18 - AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984)</p>
<p>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Offeror receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><strong>Due Dates:</strong><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Questions must be submitted via email to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil</strong></span> by noon on January 11, 2011.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

2.	Scope of Work:  Vendor will provide all labor, material and technical expertise to survey, identify, and map all communications cabling in the Bay Pines HCS signal manhole system and building entry points.  This system consists of  app.30 manholes and app. 20 buildings with multiple entry points on the US Dept of Veterans Affairs property located at 10000 Bay Pines Blvd, Bay Pines Fl 33744.  The vendor will enter each manhole, Junction Box and Crawl space to identify the existing cables, fibers and the capacity and size of each conduit entering and exiting each manhole and buildings, to include pathways for building to building.  The vendor will enter each building and identify the type of each cable & fibers and its spare capacity at all entry points. Labeling and identifying of cable will be part of the identifying process.  The survey will locate the manhole by GPS coordinates obtaining the longitude and latitude and these coordinates shall be put on a layer within the VA site plan in AUTOCAD format.  The vendor will remove all un- identified abandoned cables or fibers from the manholes to building entry point.

Once the survey has been completed all information will be documented in AUTOCAD version 2011 format and with AIA symbols and layers:

<DESC>&nbsp;****&nbsp;AMENDMENT CLOSING DATE IS AMENDED FROM <span>2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), Thursday, December 23, 2010 TO <span><strong>2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), Thursday, December 30, 2010</strong>*<strong>***</strong></span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 (g) and with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Solicitation number is: OPM20-11-T-0001 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-47 dated December 13, 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 721110, and the small business size standard is $30.0 million. This procurement is unrestricted, allowing both large and small business to submit quotations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM), Employee Services (ES) provides policy direction and leadership in designing, developing and promulgating Government-wide human resources systems and programs for recruitment, pay, leave, performance management and recognition, employee development, work/life/wellness programs and labor and employee relations; provides technical support to agencies regarding the full range of human resources management policies and practices, to include veterans' employment and agency program evaluation; and manages the operation of OPM's internal human resources program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ES's Recruitment and Hiring designs, develops, and promulgates merit-based employment systems, policies, regulations, and programs that Federal agencies use to recruit, examine, hire, classify and assess high quality employees from diverse backgrounds. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Recruitment and USAJOBS&reg;, a sub-component of ES, is responsible for designing, developing, and managing USAJOBS, Student Programs, and Diversity Policy and Outreach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, Student Programs is responsible for Government-wide student programs, such as <a href="http://www.usajobs.gov/EI/students.asp#icc"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">Student Educational Employment Programs (STEP/SCEP)</span></a>, Presidential Management Fellows (PMF), and for building a "student ambassador" and "college recruitment" program.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bearing the Presidential moniker, the PMF Program is a flagship leadership development program at the entry level for advanced degree candidates. It was created more than three decades ago by Executive Order and has gone through many changes over the years.&nbsp;The PMF Program brings in graduate degree candidates from diverse educational backgrounds into the Federal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Program is highly selective and competitive. In 2010, less than 900 applicants were selected as Finalists out of an applicant pool of nearly 9,000. After being deemed a Finalist, a prospective PMF must find a job in a participating Federal department or agency. If they successfully complete the requirements of the Program, PMFs can be noncompetitively converted to career civil service status at the end of the two-year period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program assessment process is undergoing significant changes to now include an in-person component to the selection. This component will strengthen the selection process and ensure a pool of high-caliber finalists.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new PMF assessment is a multi-hurdle process, with an online, un-proctored assessment serving as a pre-screen for all applicants, followed by a smarter, more manageable in-person assessment for 1,500 semi-finalists in four locations. The online assessment is a cost-effective method for screening an increasing number of applicants. The in-person assessment is a more resource intensive process, which puts semi-finalists through a day-long assessment consisting of individual presentations, group activities, and a proctored writing exercise. Performance is scored against a structured rubric by a three-assessor panel. Finalists will be identified based on a cut-off score of the assessment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, in support of its mission and goals, the PMF program <span style="LETTER-SPACING: 0.1pt; COLOR: black">has a need for a single facility in downtown Atlanta, GA, </span><span style="COLOR: black">located within walking distance from the MARTA metro/train and accessible via public transportation from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (</span><span style="COLOR: black">ATL</span><span style="COLOR: black">), as well as</span> within a five to ten minute walk from surrounding parking facilities, <span style="LETTER-SPACING: 0.1pt; COLOR: black">t</span><span style="LETTER-SPACING: 0.1pt">o <span style="COLOR: black">conduct in-person assessments of </span></span>approximately 160 PMF Semi-Finalists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall provide all labor, incidental materials, and other services necessary to render services under the resulting contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment (Amendment II) is to correct the information given in Amendment I and to change the List of Requirements attachment to the solicitation. Because Apple no longer offers a Solid State Drive on the Apple Xserve servers, this specification has been removed from the List of Requirements. Having a third party provide the Solid state Drive could potentially void the warranty on the product. Therefore, this specification must be removed.
<p><br />This Amendment serves to attach a new List of Requirements. The updated spreadsheet is entitled "Amendment II List of Requirements." The change has been made by striking through the text for the Solid State Drive requirement. This is the only change that has been made to the attachment.&nbsp; <br /><br />In order to be technically acceptable, an offeror must meet all of the requirements detailed in this solicitation, including compliance with each of the requirements/specifications from the Amendment II List of Requirements attachment.</p>
<p>The response deadline for Solicitation SB1341-11-RQ-0043 is extended from December 29, 2010 at 12:00 pm EST to December 30, 2010 at 12:00 pm EST.</p>

INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners. Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403). Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services. The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners. Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts. The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC. This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots. Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc) The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support. These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options. The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. Capabilities Package: All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009. The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00. We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions. Points of Contact: The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil. All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team. Do not provide proprietary information in your questions to the contracting officer since all questions and answers will be shared amongst all interested parties.

Solicitation will be available for download from our website listed below, by clicking on "Bid Board Sol".<BR>*****<BR>A staff ride for the Commanding General, USAREUR/7A, is a senior leader training event of great complexity and will be conducted to high standards in technical, historical, administrative, and support areas. This staff ride program exists as a critical vehicle by which the CG, USAREUR/7A can train and mentor his senior military and civilian leaders using U.S. Army battles of the First and Second World Wars as a training vehicle. In addition, the CG, USAREUR/7A utilizes this periodic senior leader training event as a means by which he and the USAREUR/7A senior leaders can engage with fellow senior leaders from other American armed services and from foreign armies whose nations are very important in both the U.S. national and U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) engagement strategies. These staff rides will not focus on tactical operations but on the important strategic and operational issues (most notably joint and combined operations) which can be examined during the campaigns and battles reviewed on the staff ride.

Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme Corp. of West Point Pennsylvania has been determined to be the only responsible source for this requirement in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered to be in the government's best interest due to the fact that Merck is the only company which has exclusive full capabilities to store and in particular, rotate the following vaccines without additional purchases, that Merck manufactures:
<p>Line Item/Number of Doses/Vaccine name/Number of Months&nbsp; <br />0001 3,675,000 Measles, Mumps &amp; Rubella (MMR) Vaccine 12 <br />0002 3,750,000 Varicella Vaccine 12 <br />0003 2,200,000 Hepatitis B (Hep B) Vaccine 12 <br />0004 1,700,000 Haemophilus b Conjugate (Hib) Vaccine 12 <br />0005 1,000,000 Hepatitis A Vaccine 12 <br />0006 500,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hepatitis B-Hib Combination Vaccine 12 <br />0007 2,500,000 Rotavirus Vaccine 12 <br />0008 234,460&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HPV Vaccine 12</p>
<p>Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible qualified large business and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. The Solicitation number for this requirement is 2011-Q-MERCK. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. Material will be held at the contractor furnished storage site for subsequent delivery as required by the contract. The storage site shall be located at one or more domestic facility (i.e.) that is/are controlled by the Contractor. The Contractor shall only store the product in filled, labeled, ready-to-use containers in the stockpile. Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corporation is located at 770 Sumneytown Pike, West Point, PA 19486-8000.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS FOR SELECTION OF A FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACT FOR A-E DESIGN OF A MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURE TEST &amp; EVALUATION FACILITY, FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND<br /><br />UNRESTRICTED COMPETITION<br /><br />1. CONTRACT INFORMATION<br />This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. It is anticipated that (1) firm fixed price "C" contract will be awarded for design services required for the construction of a Medical Countermeasure Test &amp; Evaluation Facility located on the National Interagency Biodefense Campus at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The estimated construction cost of this project is in the range of $400 million to $800 million. The contract will be negotiated as a fixed fee with a base scope of work and options as deemed necessary and may include fast-track design packages under Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) procedures. Selection of A-E firms is based upon the professional qualifications necessary for performance of the required services. A-E services are required for site investigation, planning, programming, survey and geotech report (option), engineering studies including permit application, schematic design (charrette), concept design, final design, commissioning (option), and construction phase services (option) for the subject project. Construction phase services will include laboratory/vivarium bio-containment commissioning, preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, and shop drawing review and approval. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330. The Product Service Code (PSC) is C118, Research and Development Facilities. This is an unrestricted acquisition and is open to all businesses regardless of size. A firm fixed price A-E contract will be negotiated with a 7-year period of performance; to include approximately two (2) years for design deliverables and five (5) years for the construction phase services. The contract is anticipated to be awarded by June 2011. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it plans to subcontract. The plan is not required with this submittal. <br /><br />SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS: In accordance with FAR 19.702(a)(1), a subcontracting plan is required if the firm is a large business. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers goal for small business utilization is 50.0% to small business (SB) dispersed as follows; 17.0% to small disadvantaged business (SDB), 18.0% to women-owned small business (WOSB), 10.0% to HUB Zone small business, 8.5% to Veteran Owned Small Business, and 4.0% Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). While these are Department of the Army Small Business Subcontracting Goals for FY11, it is the contractor's responsibility to provide realistic, challenging, and achievable goals set forth in a subcontracting plan and will be negotiated prior to contract award. Subcontracting plans will be evaluated IAW FAR 19.705-4, and must receive a rating of "acceptable". Failure to submit and negotiate an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan will make any Large Business Offeror ineligible for contract award. <br /><br />2. PROJECT INFORMATION<br />This project will provide dedicated animal testing and evaluation facilities for biodefense and infectious disease countermeasure development, including products and procedures as a result of research. The project will provide an approximately 460,000 square-foot, new multi-story medical research facility at Fort Detrick, Maryland.
