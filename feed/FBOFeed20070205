Blank GSA Form 300 will be posted; this contains standard clauses and will be used for the purchase order. Award is anticipated for 2/19/2007.  This acquisition is pursuant to simplified acquisition procedures.  

Award will be made on the basis of price, and adequacy of warranty.

Price may be recorded on the Standard Form 18 to be posted, or may be provided in letter format. 

Send any questions to Mark.Levi@gsa.gov.

This is a brand name specification IAW FAR 11.105, because the controllers must be installed as part of an existing proprietary Johnson Controls Metasys building automation system, and replacing the system as a whole would be cost prohibitive.  Under the nonmanufacturer rule (because the product is manufactured by a large business) this requirement is issued subject to unrestricted competition.  Any responsible source may provide a quote.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Alphamed Inc., 20 Juniper Ridge Road, Acton MA 01720 for three (3) Ra-224 Isotope Generators with additional processing to remove stable Pb. 

The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) oversees a laboratory and a patient treatment clinic.  The ROBs focus is on the treatment of cancer cells using radiation while trying to protect the normal cell tissue.  The laboratory area uses isotope material as part of the ongoing radiation experiments.  The chemistry section of the ROB has been working with radiochemicals and isotopes in their projects and collaborations for the clinic, laboratory, and NIH community for many years.

There is a tremendous need to have stable chemicals and isotopes in these ongoing projects.  One of the isotopes used is Ra-224.  This isotope is under exclusive control of AlphaMed via a contract with the Department of Energy.  This contract gives exclusive rights to AlphaMed to extract Ra-224 from Thorium-228, which is a by-product left over from the production of weapons.  There is no other source known to the NCI that can provide this product.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Barrett H. Ripin, 7536 Sebago Road, Bethesda, MD 20817, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), soliciting from a single source.    The requirement is for technical assistance to the Office of International and Academic Affairs (OIAA), in the administration of the bilateral program between NIST and the Government of Pakistan; and technical assistance to OIAA in the administration of bilateral and multilateral programs in India, Egypt, Saudia Arabia, and the Gulf Cooperation Countries. This requires liaison with scientists at NIST and counterpart institutes regarding technical activities.  Duties will also require an in depth understanding of, and the ability to perform analyses and evaluations of scientific and technical programs in the context of NIST, Department of Commerce (DoC) and administration objectives, and to maintain current awareness of the state of technology and the relationship of NIST programs.  The performance of these duties requires a contractor with current knowledge of the assigned work regions, as the immediacy of the work does not allow for a training period.  The contractor must be very familiar with the main regions of Pakistan, India, other regions of Asia, and regional Islamic nations, and must be qualified to assist in Science and Technology (S&T) collaborations between these countries and the U.S. through NIST.  The contractor identified here for consideration is uniquely qualified to immediately assume and carry out the described tasks in the identified regions.  During his five years at the Department of State, he worked directly with the south Asia and contacts in the regional Islamic areas to promote S&T collaborations.  He was the key person to negotiate and conclude umbrella S&T agreements between the U.S. and Pakistan, and the U.S. and India, and worked closely with numerous government officials in the two countries.  His work at the Department of State also included collaborations with other Asian and Islamic countries, which would be applicable to the required tasks of this requirement.  He also holds a doctorate in physics with over 20 years of experience at the Naval Research Laboratory in the research areas in plasma and space physics.  Both his diplomatic and scientific backgrounds will facilitate the required tasks of liaison with NIST scientists and international counterparts in the various international science and technology collaborations.  A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about February 14, 2006. The performance period will begin approximately February 15, 2007 through March 14, 2008.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Estimated quantity/outstanding $ of prescription receivables    63,865/$3,970,732  	(as of 1/24/07) Statement of Work for Accounts Receivable The contractor shall provide collection, follow-up and remittance review on all open prescription accounts receivable assigned to the contractor by the VISN 9 Mid-South Customer Accounts Center.  The major emphasis on this project is to review no-pay remittances and determine if there is any additional revenue to be gained to achieve optimum collection of prescription insurance claims.  If no revenue is anticipated, closing each claim with an appropriate denial justification.  *THE STATEMENT OF WORK WILL NOT BE CONFINED TO PRESCRIPTION THIRD PARTY RECEIVABLE REMITTANCES.  THERE MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE OTHER THIRD PARTY RECEIVABLE REMITTANCES MAY BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THIS PROJECT. *  Follow-up and remittance review activities shall be accomplished in such a way as to achieve optimum collection from the insurance carrier(s), or appropriate adjustments within the AR package with proper justification after review of remittances.  The review of no-pay (zero) remittances is crucial in keeping aged receivables to a minimum and the established GDRO (Gross Days Revenue Outstanding) within acceptable standards. This will include a review of VISTA reports as well as appropriate processing of correspondence including insurance remittances or explanation of benefits (EOBs). The contractor shall provide the service with a thorough understanding of electronic documentation requirements, coding requirements, and appeal processes.   The contractor will identify those accounts that may warrant investigation for possible appeal or other actions.  For those cases, contractor shall perform the collection activities including the working of rejections and the administrative appeals processes. Once the contractor begins work on a claim, the contractor must follow the claim until it is recommended for closure.  Mid-South Customer Accounts Center staff will provide initial training to the Contractor on-site. Contractor staff may provide services on-site.  Additional consultation may be provided by off-site contractor staff.  Approval for off-site work must be approved by Mid-South Customer Accounts Center on an individual basis. Results of followup activity shall be provided in one of three methods.  1) A monthly report indicating total activity accomplished by the contractor, including number of accounts referred for review, number of accounts reviewed, dollar amount of claims involved in review and any other pertinent information agreed upon by the MCAC and/or the contractor. 2) A worksheet or email shall be provided for cases requiring action by the Mid-South Customer Accounts Center (see Attachment A). 3) A contractual adjustment within the Accounts Receivable Vista software, based on information provided by the insurance carrier, either by remittance, website or telephone conversation.  Contractor will use this option only after being sufficiently trained, and will complete adjustments with appropriate justifications as provided by Mid-South Customer Accounts Center.  The Mid-South Customer Accounts Center retains the right to not allow the contractor to perform adjustments to receivables if errors occur that result in not achieving optimum collections or appropriate claim closures. The format of the log, worksheet, and/or email can be modified upon the mutual agreement of the Mid-South Customer Accounts Center and the contractor.  The contractor will maintain a file at the Mid-South Customer Accounts Center with review sheets/ communications/ reports, and will enter appropriate electronic comments into VISTA.  The contractor will obtain patient information and copies of medical records when needed, and will provide access to EOBs, Insurance Correspondence, Claims Tracking, and other documents as needed regarding each claim.  The Mid-South Customer Accounts Center will provide space, work table/desk, chair and PC for one on-site contract employee; actual records (paper and/or electronic), and limited computer database access to VISTA options for contract employees located off-site.  Access will be provided to a copy machine, telephone, and FAX machine, if located on-site. Review of remittances commences when forwarded to the contactor by the MCAC.  Remittances will be thoroughly reviewed for appropriate denials; and corresponding AR claims are decrease adjusted.  Those denials deemed collectible will have aggressive telephone followup or written correspondence completed until payment is secured.  Follow-up will be performed on all prescription receivables when they are sixty (60) days old or when insurance remittances are received and forwarded to contactor; and until they are recommended for closure by the contractor, or have been paid by the insurance carrier.  Contractor will provide a grace period for payment receipt after referral of claim (generally 10 days).  The contractor will not recoup payments received within this period.  Payment will not be made on any receivable that has had no followup, but is paid by the insurance carrier.  A minimum of four aggressive telephone followup or written correspondence to the insurance carrier will be initiated before recommendations to close a claim are initiated.   Mid-South Customer Accounts Center reserves the right to restrict certain carriers, or certain accounts depending on the center's needs.  This restriction request will be initiated before the account/claim becomes 60 days old.  MCAC will annotate each claim with ***MCAC APPEAL to alert contractor of followup exclusion.  Restriction of carriers will be kept to a minimum to allow the contractor for range of outstanding prescription accounts. The Mid-South Customer Accounts Center will provide a monthly detailed report of each payment posted to an insurance claim that the contractor has provided sufficient, quality documented electronic followup, or has closed the claim with appropriate closure justification(s), unless otherwise noted that the contractor will accomplish this process.  Invoice billings will be prepared to the Mid-South Customer Accounts Center on a monthly basis.  An invoice may not be billed on an insurance claim until follow-up is complete and the bill is recommended for closure or paid by the insurance carrier.  Payment to the vendor will be determined by a percentage of collections received from the insurance carrier, and by the number of claims closed due to review of no-pay remittances.  Contractor will be paid for work completed prior to the expiration of the contract, and for three months after the contract has expired or ended. Refund requests determined to be valid on claims previously paid in which a contractor's invoice has been submitted and paid, will have a future invoice reduced by the refunded amount.  Detailed actions will appear as an addendum on the Mid-South Customer Accounts Center monthly detailed payment report.  Documentation on the refund request will be provided to the contractor. Specific accounts or insurance carriers that have been restricted from the contractor's responsibility will not be paid to the contractor, even if the contractor has provided followup activity.  Detailed actions will appear as an addendum on the Mid-South Customer Accounts Center monthly detailed payment report.  Documentation on the restrictions will be provided to the contractor. Claims that should be appealed for medical reasons will be referred to the Mid-South Customer Accounts Center to complete the appeal process.  The contractor will provide specific information to the Mid-South Customer Accounts Center on what needs to be appealed. Time schedules and deadlines are to be established based on mutual agreement of the Mid-South Customer Accounts Center and the contractor.  Failure of the contractor to meet VHA deadlines may result in canceling all or part of the contract. Contractor will be responsible for maintaining aged receivables to specific end-of-month outstanding percentages by dollar amount.  There will be documented evidence that the oldest aged receivables are worked for followup and final disposition, before new referred accounts are worked.  Contract performance has been established with the following outstanding accounts receivable balance portfolio to be achieved as satisfactory: Between 91-120 days -   no more than 6% of outstanding rx receivables Between 121-180 days - no more than 5% of outstanding rx receivables Between 180-365 days - no more than 4% of outstanding rx receivables 		Over 365 days -              no more than 1% of outstanding rx receivables (performance measure will be reviewed starting at the end of the second month of the contract) Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, transportation, and supervision necessary to provide these services.  Unclear policies will be discussed with the Mid-South Customer Accounts Center for clarification.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The scope of the Repair Aprons, Phase 2B project (Project Number WWCX 05-1036B) requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to correct deficient sub-grade drainage and reconstruct sub-grade depressions in airfield aprons at Thule Air Base, Greenland.  The work includes but is not limited to leveling the base coarse and replacing deteriorated pavement (approximately 15,200 SY), including painting and markings.  The contractor shall be responsible for determining the amount of work needed to fulfill the requirements of the contract specifications and drawings.  All quantities listed in the contract documents are estimates only. The awardee will be responsible for determining actual needs.  Rock materials shall be mined and milled on-site at Thule Greenland utilizing the awardee?s equipment. The awardee will be responsible for obtaining the necessary shipping and use permits for explosives, etc. required to perform the work. The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October. Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift. Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally. The project magnitude is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The performance period for this project shall be approximately 2 years from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). FUNDS ARE PRESENTLY NOT AVAILABLE, BUT ARE  EXPECTED TO BE MADE AVAILABLE BY MARCH 2007. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THE SOLICITATION, EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE PROPOSAL CLOSING DATE.Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation.  Price will be evaluated equally with Past Performance. A more favorable past performance rating may result in award to other than the lowest priced offeror, based on the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation. It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically on or about 23 February 2007 with offers due 30 days thereafter. Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted.  This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4) International Agreement, to US, Danish and Greenlandic firms.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to provide responses to additional questions received.

1)The draft PWS does not include a task for Mission Planning.  Will this be included?  Yes, this will be included in the final PWS.  2)The twenty page limit for Volume II, Contractor?s Technical Proposal may be inadequate to provide concise background on proposed number of personnel.  Will there be key personnel/key positions identified?  At this time, we have not decided if key personnel/key positions will be identified.
3)CLIN 3001 is identical to CLIN 3034.  Is this correct?  No, CLIN 3034 should be for Project Planning Management Support.
4)CLIN 0001, Mobilization; does this refer to possible world-wide deployability of support?  Mobilization is for any costs associated with transitioning to begin work by the date required.
5)What are the challenges 9 RW is currently experiencing?  Overall, the largest is cost constraints and budget reductions throughout the Air Force.  In operations and mission support, the challenge is flexibility of overseas/TDY staffing.  In training and scheduling, the challenge has been identifying and preventing confusion on the chain of command.
6)Is the customer willing to use technology to improve processes? Yes.

<DESC>Requirement:

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Workforce Effectiveness, is responsible for delivering the full suite of human resources management services to the OCC, its managers, and its employees.  The structure of the HR organization has evolved in recent years, as staffing changes have occurred and in response to specific needs and requirements that have arisen.  In addition, the leadership of the Office of Workforce Effectiveness has recently changed.  

The OCC requires expert consulting support to develop specific proposals, in partnership with OCC and WFE leadership, for structuring the HR organization to ensure alignment with its vision of satisfying customer needs through sustained operational excellence, continuous improvement, and accountability and responsiveness to customers.  

As well, support may be needed in planning for a transition to a new structure and in the change management aspects associated with transforming an organizational structure, functions, processes, and people. 

Specific tasks may include:   
 
Data Collection

Collecting information on OCC?s current HR organization, including its current structure, processes, and workforce; current and future requirements, and performance issues or gaps experienced by the organization.  

Organizational Analysis

Analyzing the data collected to identify proposed options for addressing organizational issues and structuring the organization to meet current and future performance objectives.  WFE leadership will play an integral role in this effort, analyzing the data, validating the current vision, assessing specific organizational options, and developing a proposal for organizational change.

Transition Planning and Support

Depending on the recommendations made, the OCC may require assistance in transitioning from the current organization to the proposed organization.  As needed, this could include support for communication and change management; further analysis of workload, staffing, processes, and other elements of the organizational change; additional documentation of processes and procedures; refining of HR career paths, hiring practices, and developmental requirements, based on the new organizational concept; and development of metrics for monitoring the effectiveness of the new organizational concept and continuing to refine the organization to maximize its performance.

<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and neither constitutes a RFP, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the 329th Armament Systems Group to determine potential sources capable of providing a Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) for DoD Ranges.  Potential sources should include their size status for NAICS code 334511.  CRIIS will provide enhanced time, space, position information (TSPI) accuracy and selected participant data bus information for test and training event participants, incorporating an advanced spectrally efficient data link.  CRIIS will be developed consistent with an overall goal of maximizing commonality among range instrumentation systems for test and evaluation and training applications.  Development will be funded through the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), with follow-on production funded by the individual Services.  

CRIIS development will significantly improve the T&E range capabilities in 5 major areas:  (1) Enhanced data transfer flexibility; (2) Increased TSPI accuracy at faster rates; (3) Component miniaturization and modularity for internal mounting flexibility; (4) Standardization of interface protocols and an open architecture design, to support replacement of future components resulting from obsolescence and changes in technology; and (5) Enhanced system encryption capability.

The test requirements are well established at this time (see Attachment #2). The top level training requirements are: (1) operation on different frequencies; (2) accommodating a different waveform; (3) accommodating Multiple Levels of Security (MLS); (4) accommodating detached clusters; and (5) accommodating burst mode transmissions.

Potential offerors should deliver a Statement of Capabilities in accordance with Numbered Note 25, specifically addressing your area(s) of expertise and whether your company would be interested in being a prime contractor or subcontractor for this effort.  Discuss your experience in designing, developing, fabricating, testing and maintaining similar systems.  If interested in being a prime, discuss your company?s experience in accomplishing complex system architecture definition, design, and development. Your response must include sufficient backup data to support your answers and/or recommendations in order to conduct meaningful exchanges.  In addition, offerors are requested to comment on questions contained in attached document titled "Questions for Responders" (see Attachment #1).

An industry day, with one-on-one discussions, is anticipated in the near future.  Until such time, questions and/or comments should be submitted to the following e-mail address:  329arsg.criis@eglin.af.mil.  An answer will be provided by return e-mail and all questions and answers will be posted on the FedBizOpps site.  It is the responsibility of industry to monitor www.fedbizopps.gov for the release of any follow-on information.  

Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  The Government requests interested offerors submit one (1) copy of their capability response no later than 4:00 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on

Any solution will be required to work in any of these situations.  Note: the provision of telecommunications facilities or infrastructure is not part of the scope of this solicitation. "	Collect demographic data requested of visitors at the fee-collecting site (e.g. ZIP code at the time of every pass sale and the number of people in the vehicle).   o	Note: Ideally, the POS Unit would prompt the operator to collect data elements randomly selected from a predefined  list of questions (e.g. ask every nth vehicle how many people are in the vehicle or if they are driving a sedan, truck, or RV) "	Capture the use of various types of  serialized park passes at the point of sale  o	Note: the serial number may either be encoded in a bar code or the magnetic stripe of the pass "	Capture detailed fee transactions electronically "	Track the issuance and sales of accountable (serialized) park pass stock, which is captured by swiping the pass at the POS Unit and is read by either a bar code or magnetic stripe reader.   "	Transmit fee transaction data to the Servicewide Fee Database  Required Configurations Several POS equipment configurations are desired to address the various collection operation levels and physical environments.   Park unit sites may request any combination of the following POS configurations.   1.	Light POS Configuration - a software-only configuration that would be able to run on any NPS Windows-based PC connected to the NPS network.  Appropriate for offices with occasional sales (which will primarily be using the PCs for other purposes).   Peripheral equipment would be limited to essentials such as a credit card reader and printer.  Total annual revenue from about 100 NPS sites with light POS units is not expected to exceed $50,000. 2.	Moderate POS Configuration -a dedicated POS unit for environments that are stable and climate-controlled, such as an indoor visitor center or campground office.  These sites may or may not have high-speed or analog connectivity.  Total annual revenue from about 75 park sites and about 200 Moderate POS units is not expected to exceed $1M. 3.	Heavy-duty POS Configuration - a dedicated POS unit for environments that are considered hostile for a PC, such as an entrance station or campground kiosk.  These units may be subject to extreme heat, dust, direct sunlight, and power fluctuations.   There will be various methods of power availability and stability (e.g. electricity, solar, battery, and generator).  Sites may or may not have high-speed or analog connectivity.  Total annual revenue from about 75 park sites (consisting of approximately 190 Heavy-duty POS units) is expected to be between $1M and $20M.   4.	Hand-held POS Configuration --  for walking lines, parking lots, campgrounds, with full transaction-processing capability.   Sites may or may not have high-speed connectivity. Optional Configurations Parks have and will continue to purchase a variety of other equipment for either the collection of fees, processing of fees, or the security of fees.  Each variation has unique requirements and has been supplied by different companies.   The long-term goal is for the centralized POSS database to be integrated with the optional equipment mentioned below, either through one contract or through multiple contracts.  For this Sources Sought notice, contractors are not required to, but may wish to address the following optional equipment configurations: 1.	Light Self-Service / Automated Fee Machines for indoor environments that are stable and where the visitor can purchase the recreational permit directly at the unit.  Locations where this could be implemented would be in community-based welcome centers, local businesses, or additional POS units at a visitor center, or campground office for use in peak seasons. 2.	Heavy-duty Self-Service / Automated Fee Machines for outdoor environments that must be appropriate for extreme weather (i.e.  exposure to sun, rain, heat, cold, humidity, salinity, electrical storms), vandalism, and power fluctuations).    These would typically be used for campground payments, after-hour entrance sales, or non-staffed entry locations.  3.	Automated Gate for additional lanes to process re-entry, annual pass users, or local traffic with a pass, in order to expedite the processing of vehicles at entrance stations or for locations that are non-staffed.  4.	Security Systems where cameras can capture incoming and outgoing traffic at entrance stations, employee actions during fee collection activities, and areas where deposits are processed.  System would overlay the POS electronic journal onto the video capture of the POS transaction, capture the license plate of the visitor vehicle at the point of entry, and be able to conduct a search of the data captured.   Contractors are encouraged to present any capabilities they have for supporting these optional equipment configurations. Servicewide Fee Database The purpose of the Servicewide Fee Database is to:  "	Allow for storage and retrieval of captured transaction and statistical metric data from park point of sale units "	Allow for the import of structured data of fee-collecting activities from external systems (e.g. automated fee machines, hand held devices)  "	Allow for manual entry of fee-collecting activities from external systems (e.g. iron Rangers/canisters)  "	Ability for park unit staff to reconcile submitted shift reports from collections in terms of products sold, serialized pass numbers sold, and type of payment.  "	Prepare the Deposit Ticket SF215 for electronic upload from the Fee Database into the Treasury TGAnet program for cash/check deposits.  The SF215 is a report that itemizes collected cash and checks to be deposited by revenue account code.    "	Ability for Park Unit Staff to reconcile credit card transactions through the Treasury Credit and Debit Card Acquiring Services (this process is preferably completed through an automatic upload of total daily sales by park POS unit merchant account,  which provides the product detail by revenue account code for the total daily sales to the NPS financial systems  "	Allow for the management of inventory of accountable (serialized) property sold to visitors (e.g. park passes)	 "	Allow for flexible programming of the park unit rates and product lists sold  "	Allow for electronic reconciliation of deposited fees by the Fee Database with exported deposit reports from NPS financial systems "	Allow fee-collecting activities and receipts to be audited "	Allow for park, regional, and national Fee Program Managers to efficiently generate recurring and ad hoc financial reports for Recreation Fee Program Operations  "	NPS IT standards require that the database run on either an Oracle or SQL Server platform  It is yet to be determined whether the database will be hosted on NPS systems in Lakewood, Colorado or in a commercial hosting facility.  Contractors may address either or both options. Integration with Existing Systems The NPS has a number of legacy cash registers in use and would like to preserve as much value as possible from this investment.  Of the approximate 309 legacy registers in use, 37 are Merlin 6670 terminals, 182 are Datasym 6000, and 90 are Sharp ERA570.  The contractor is encouraged to, but not required to, address how this legacy equipment could be integrated into the system (e.g. data uploaded from the registers could be imported into the Servicewide Fee Database).  Support and Training Contractors should address their ability to provide help-desk, technical support, and training capabilities to the National Park Service.  Fee-collecting sites will span all time zones of the United States and its territories, and are sometimes in relatively inaccessible locations, and contractors are encouraged to consider and present approaches to installation, training, and support that reduce needed travel. Industry Day Structure The National Park Service, Recreation Fee Management Program has scheduled Industry Days from 3/5/2007-3/7/2007 in Lakewood, CO.  Interested contractors should contact Georgi Wellington (georgi_wellington@nps.gov) by email no later than March 2, 2007 for an appointment to attend the Industry Day.  No vendor will be seen without a prior scheduled appointment. Contractors will have an opportunity to present their capabilities for a maximum of 30 minutes to a panel of key subject-matter experts, in Lakewood, CO from 3/5/2007 - 3/7/2007.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the decision makers for thi s initiative. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to particip ate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/p erformance criteria using a likert like one to five rating scale. One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/per formance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the  MTFs in the Pacific Region. Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 year s).  1.

Thales equipment is currently installed at Ramstein AB and projects are underway to install 6 units at Aviano AB and another two units at Spangdahlem AB.  Thales is required to ensure consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability.  This equipment is being installed into an existing SONET network.  Each brand of link encryption device has its own monitoring suite.  If another brand was used there would be the additional fifty seven thousand dollars for the USAFE Installations covered under this purchase for the cost of monitoring software and hardware, not including any installation costs.  Thales has its own monitoring suite at no additional cost.  It allows the USAFE Network Operations and Security Center and installation Tech Control facilities to use a single vendor provided application to manage all USAFE SONET Encryption equipment.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price
	
The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement with resellers of Thales equipment to ensure prices are fair and reasonable.

8.  Description of Market Research 

The research that produced the overarching solution for the USAFE TCF Modernization Program included the evaluation of FIPS 140-2 technologies and equipment manufacturers.  This included Thales and SafeNet which are the only two FIPS 140-2 certified vendors.  The evaluation consisted of personal experiences of USAFE personnel, review of product documentation obtained from the web, vendor provided demonstrations and product documentation, review of currently fielded equipment, and GSA schedule and retail pricing lists.  Based on the evaluations, an equipment suite was chosen based on capabilities, integration, and price.  This solution included the selection of the Thales Datacryptor product line as the link encryption devices.

9.  Supporting Facts:

This brand name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the USAFE Theater. 

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

IPIntegration Inc, GS-35F-0740P, PO Box 28617, Santa Ana, Ca 92799, 714-557-5200, Small Business

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: 

USAFE CSS/SCML must remain with the Thales product line to ensure continuity, compatibility and consistency of existing equipment.  The Government would incur costs in training of personnel and reengineering of non-Thales equipment for integration with existing equipment as detailed above.  Competition is limited to multiple resellers of Thales equipment.    

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule

The Government anticipates a 30-day delivery period after contractor?s receipt of order

<DESC>The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) is issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation to acquire Employee Assistance Services for employees of NGA.  A Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearance is preferred but not mandatory.  The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and will include a base year plus four (4) one-year option periods.  The period of performance will be from date of contract award (estimated to be 1 May 2007) through May 2012, including options.  This acquisition will be solicited and awarded utilizing FAR subpart 12, Commercial Acquisitions, procedures.  The applicable North American Industry Classifiction Standard Code is 624190. This is an unrestricted solicitation.

The NGA Human Development Directorate (HD) has a requirement for Employee Assistance Services to support the needs of NGA employees and their family members.  NGA provides employees and family members with Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services such as counseling on relationships, stress management, balancing work/life issues, substance abuse, depression and anxiety, grief/loss counseling, chronic medical and physical problems, and parenting concerns.  Additionally, referral services are provided for child and elder care, legal and financial needs.

This requirement is for full and open competition.  The Government intends to award without discussion but reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary in making the award decision.  Questions will be received until 9 February 2007 at noon EST.  Only questions that may have a material change to the RFP will be accepted after 9 February 2007.  Questions and answers will be posted on FBO.  Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.  Techniques utilizing past performance information and price will be evaluated; therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror.  Solicitation HM1576-07-R-0002 is scheduled for release on 5 February 2007, with a closing date of 28 February 2007.  No telephone, fax, email or mailed requests for the RFP will be honored.  The solicitation (and any amendments) will be available for downloading on the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTEDS), website at http://www.fedteds.gov for all interested parties.  It is the responsibility of each offeror to review web pages at Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), (http://www.fbo.gov) and FedTEDS (http://www.fedteds.gov) for notice of amendments, updates or changes to current information.  Any prospective offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) now requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligation.  Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation .  The solicitation will include a Statement of Work (SOW).

(a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

ISSUANCE DATE: July 28, 2005
CLOSING DATE/TIME: August 27, 2005, 15:00 Local time, Washington, D.C.
POSITION TITLE:  Senior Rule of Law Advisor
MARKET VALUE:  $74,782 - $114,882
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two Years
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.
SECURITY ACCESS:  Secret
AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens Only

I. Scope of Work

Background

Respect for the rule of law and a well-developed justice system are underpinnings of a democratic society and a modern economy. Effective rule of law resolves conflicts and fosters social interaction in accord with legal norms and widely accepted societal values. It also enhances predictability, equitable treatment, and a respect for basic human rights; provides services in accord with societal demand and expectations; and helps curb the arbitrary exercise and abuse of power by other branches of government, elites, and other privileged groups. In all these regards, justice sector institutions must perform their functions effectively. At the same time their operations must be transparent, accountable, and in compliance with the law.

In many states with weak or incipient democratic traditions and underdeveloped economies, the processes and institutions which are necessary to uphold the rule of law are incompletely evolved and ineffective. Often, their legal framework does not correspond to social reality and contemporary needs. Customary and informal practice may cause further deviations, so that legally established rights are not recognized, inequitable treatment is the "rule," and actions and decisions respond to partisan, particularistic, or pecuniary interests. The lesser relevance of formal law and institutions is often accompanied by the limited availability of justice sector services so that large masses of the population must rely on unofficially recognized alternative mechanisms which often have their own non-democratic biases. When these conditions prevail, the rule of law, democratic reform, and sustainable economic development are all very difficult to advance. 

Just as there are many ways of defining rule of law sector elements and problems, there are also numerous ways of developing rule of law programs. USAID supports but is not limited to work in rule of law in three primary areas: 
	Improving outdated or otherwise inadequate legal frameworks and codifying human rights. 
	Strengthening justice-sector institutions and working toward independence of the judiciary. 
	Increasing citizens' access to justice.

Objective

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau for Europe and Eurasia (E&E), Office of Democracy, Governance and Social Transition, is seeking to hire under a Personal Services Contract (PSC) a qualified individual to fill the position of Senior Rule of Law Advisor.  Under the direction of the Team Chief of the Democracy and Governance Team and/or her designee, the Advisor will provide substantive analytical and technical expertise in the area of rule of law. The work will support the Bureaus objective of helping to establish full democracies rooted in the rule of law.

Duties and Responsibilities

The Advisor will serve in the Democracy Governance and Social Transition office as a member of the Democracy and Governance team.  The advisor will be responsible for provision of technical advice on a region-wide (26 countries in the Europe and Eurasia region) assistance portfolio of legal reform activities, including activities designed to improve the independence of the judiciary, protect human, rights, reduce corruption, reform criminal justice systems, improve parliaments and support post-war reconstruction and peace accord implementation (e.g. Kosovo). This includes, but is not limited to, consultations on cooperative agreements with the American Bar Association, and grants or contracts with other organizations implementing USAID assistance. It also includes full-service support to USAID missions in the region, including performing sector assessments, evaluations, project designs, inter-agency fact-finding missions, and participating in international conferences. 

The incumbent will serve as an advisor to the E&E Bureau in developing and analyzing strategies to support rule of law reform, assessing progress and constraints to rule of law progress in the E&E region, and identifying and responding to new rule of law development challenges in the E&E region as they emerge. 

The incumbent also plays a critical role in defining and formulating the content of USAIDs assistance in E&E countries such that it complements programs implemented by other USG departments, including the Department of Justice and the Department of State/International Narcotics and Law Enforcement.  S/He represents the E&E Bureau in discussions regarding USAID/E&E rule of law assistance programs with the Office of the Assistance Coordinator for Europe & Eurasia at the Department of State.   S/He serves as an interlocutor among the E&E Bureau, the DCHA Bureau, State Department, and the Department of Justice regarding USAIDs assistance for two high USG priorities for the region:  criminal justice and security sector reform, and combating corruption.  The Senior Rule of Law Advisor is essential for the Agency to fully engage with other USG counterparts in these two topics.

The Advisor will be based at USAID in Washington, DC and will:

	Assist USAID missions to formulate rule of law strategies for individual countries; reviewing strategies submitted as part of results frameworks; directing rule of law assessments; directing rule of law contract and/or grant evaluations; reviewing unsolicited proposals; responding to Congressional inquiries.

	Perform directed travel within the E&E region to provide hands-on consultations, strategy formulation, assessments, and monitoring of on-going Rule of Law activities.

	Serve as a senior advisor to the Europe and Eurasia Bureau with regard to the status of all justice sector reform in the E&E region, including activities of other USG agencies, host governments, other donors and non-governmental organizations.  With an in-depth knowledge of USAID's rule of law programs across the region, represent the Agency in inter-agency and international forums with regard to such issues as justice sector reconstruction, human rights, police and security sector reform, transitional justice, war crimes, anti-corruption and other topics as they relate to USAID's current or potential rule of law programming.

	Provide briefings to U.S. and foreign officials, Congress, and other donors on USAID programming in the region.  Facilitate visits by foreign officials and delegations to USAID.  

	Act as Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for assigned contracts and grants, including day-to-day responsibility for monitoring implementation of activities, tracking financial issues, processing obligation actions and other requests to OP under the contracts/grants, and responding to requests. Management will provide a CTO training opportunity.

<SUBJECT>R -- Developing a More Strategic Approach to Federal Student Financial Aid for Higher Education
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-EDOOOS-07-000021
<RESPDATE>021207
<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Federal student financial aid falls generally into three categories: grants, loans, and tax benefits. Statutes and regulations have created more than twenty federal student aid programs that do not harmonize to meet a comprehensive national policy goal. The Spellings Commission on the Future of Education describes the current system in its final report, A Test of Leadership:

'We found that that our federal financial aid system is confusing, complex, inefficient, duplicative, and frequently does not direct aid to students who truly need it. We propose replacing the current maze of financial aid programs, rules, and regulations with a system more in line with student needs and national priorities. That effort would require a significant increase in need-based financial aid and a complete restructuring of the current federal financial aid system. Our recommendations call for consolidating programs, streamlining processes, and replacing the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) with a much shorter and simpler application.'
For reference, please see the attached Issue Paper written for the Commission on the Future of Higher Education.  This is a link to the Issue Paper http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/hiedfuture/reports/burgdorf-kostka.pdf.

A new federal financial aid system should achieve the policy objectives described above and address (at least) the following key issues:

*Complexity and confusion among users, leading to underutilization and yielding little data to understand their impact on access and retention;
*Countervailing incentives and disincentives for buyers of higher education, and
*Overlapping and redundant programs.

Outcomes Desired from a Two-Stage Approach:

1.	Phase 1: Vision Facilitation & Creation: The Department of Education (ED) is in the process of selecting a firm to facilitate a one-day meeting of financial aid experts in February 2007.  The meeting will consist of common time for participants, and breakouts of simultaneously-facilitated visioning by equal-sized groups of experts. The purpose of the meeting is to obtain experts' individual thoughts and perspective on this important issue.  The session will be an opportunity for a robust exchange of information between the experts and the contracted facilitator.

ED seeks an additional contractor to collaborate with this firm, participate in the meeting, and produce multiple strategic-level simulation models on options for a new federal financial aid system, derived from this meeting.  The models shall quantify trade-offs associated with options for a new federal financial aid system. The simulation models shall help policymakers evaluate options and select a preferred one before initiating Phase II.  

Modeling and simulations of alternative solutions should include the input of experts and be able to compare the extent to which different options:

*Focus Federal resources to students with greatest need;
*Make the student aid programs more understandable and predictable for students and families;
*Address real and perceived concerns about the financial burden on students and families of college;
*Refocus Federal, state, and institutional partnerships in support of the policy objectives;
*Recognize cause and effect links that interconnect the relevant entities of the system
*Minimize or eliminate the relationship between Federal subsidies, tuition and institutional cost increases;
*Minimize the extent to which Federal laws and rules encourage a substitution of state and institutional expenditures for higher education; 
*Reduce the expensive, burdensome and intrusive role of higher education institutions in validating family income data for aid eligibility;
*Reduce the potential for identity theft among aid applicants; and
*Make the programs easier to administer and more accountable to the taxpayer. 
*Identify new products, services, processes, and partnerships that could deliver a higher volume of financial aid to eligible recipients

Deliverables:

The contractor is to provide technically competent staff to:
*Attend the one-day meeting, which includes two concurrent breakouts, to be held in Washington, DC in February 2007 (date to be determined before awarding of contract); contractor will be responsible for it's own equipment (i.e. laptop, software) at the meetings;

2. Scope of effort:  A two-stage review of the federal student aid system with recommendations for the optimal design and implementation of a system that achieves the following policy objectives: 1) increased enrollment in college by those students who would not have been able to attend; 2) increased retention and graduation by students who might not have been to complete college due to cost, and 3) decreased debt burden. 

3. Phase 2: Solution Design and Implementation Planning: Using the preferred option derived from Phase 1, the second phase will focus on solution design feasibility testing. This Phase will include development of implementation plans, a cost/benefit analysis, and additional analysis and recommendations necessary to make specific changes to existing policies, programs, technology, and any other elements to implement the preferred option for a new federal financial aid system.

<CONTACT>Audrey Taylor, Contract Specialist, Phone 571-227-1582, Fax 571-227-2913, Email audrey.taylor@dhs.gov
<DESC>Question: Upon closer review of the solicitation, it became clear that the Government did not dictate how many watch standers are required per shift.

Answer: Correct, the Government is not asking for a specific quantity of people per shift. We are asking for 12 Watch Standers to work 80 hours per Government bi-weekly pay period.   The Contractor will work rotating shifts defined by the Government. The shift schedule is posted 14 days in advance and includes weekend and holidays.  

Question: Please clarify if the Government is defining an FTE as 2,080 or 1,920 hours per work-year?
Answer: The Government will be paying for 12 Watch Standers, each working 80 hours per government biweekly pay period. There are 26 Government bi-weekly pay periods in a year. The total annual work hours are 2080 per Watch Stander.  ( 80 X 26 = 2080)
 
The Government understands that a Contractor will get sick or take a vacation.  Any illness over 24 hours will require the Vendor to provide a replacement for the shift. If the Contractor is on vacation, the Vendor will provide a replacement during the vacation period.  

Question: Do signed NDA?s need to be included in the proposal or will that be handled on the first day of the contract?

Answer: Prior to the first day of the contract.

Question: Amendment 1 states that 24,960 hours are for six personnel. Is this a typographical error? Are the 24,960 for 12 personnel?

Answer: The requirement is for 12 people/24,960 annually except to account for leap year in 2008.

Question: Is the expectation that there will be six contractors per shift on the Watch Floor or will scheduling done by the government allow for days off etc?

Answer: Please see above response

Question: on page 31 & 32 of document HSTS03-07-R-CAC010-Watch Floor Support, appears evaluation criteria including criteria for evaluating firms with experience, and firms with no experience.  The wording seems to be at variance with the wording of the section labeled ?Past Performance Evaluation Criteria? on page 3 of 4 of the other document labeled RFP Instructions.
Please clarify how firms with much, some, little or no, past experience will be evaluated, and more specifically which of the two evaluation methodologies takes precedence in the event of a conflict. 
Answer: The question is unclear. Offerors with no past performance will not be penalized and will be rated as neutral. 

Question: The proposal must be submitted in 12 point font but if we use graphics can the font size go smaller than 12 point and if so, will there be a size limit on that?
Answer: Yes, must be submitted in 12 point font. 

Question:  Can you please clarify the definition of UNITS in the RFP?
Answer: UNITS=hours per year required

Question: Are the past performance citations required in Volume 1 included in the 10 page technical and management approach, or in addition to the 10 page limit for Volume 1?
Answer: Past performance is included in the ten 10 page limitation for Volume 1.
Question:  CLIN?s 1 thru 5 in Section B reflects a number (276,480) under the column titled ?UNIT?. Can you explain what this number means?
Answer: This number reflects the total amount of hours per year for the Watch Floor Standers.  This number has also been updated and reflects the correct amount of hours in amendment 1 posted on FEDBIZOPS.

Question: Paragraph 5.0 (Scope) states that, ?the scope of this procurement is to staff the TSOC Watch Floor 24/7/365 with 12 Full Time Watch Standers?. Does the Government require a total of 12 Watch Standers per shift, which would require a far greater number of personnel to support the Government?
Answer: Please see above response.

Question: In the instruction for Volume 2, it states, ?Provide an overall and detailed fixed price for the base year and all option years?as well as clearly identify the tasks as well as the composition of the pricing??yet in the SOW, the government states that the requirement is for 12 Watch Standers, all having same job requirements. Please clarify pricing instructions in view of requirement for 12 contractors with the same labor category requirements.
Answer: Please identify the labor category(ies) and hourly rate composition for the fixed price effort.

Question: Paragraph 9.0 states ?The rotating shifts will be designed by the Government and supplied to the contractor.? Yet, a requirement for Volume 1 is to ?Provide a sample staffing?plan.? In context with Questions 4 and 7, please clarify how a sample staffing plan can be determined if the Contractor won?t know the rotating shifts until after award?
Answer: TSA wishes to see how the proposing vendors currently staff as part of the management approach. 

Question: Paragraph H.6 in SOW states contractor staff shall work 8 hour shifts between 7:30-5:30 Monday-Friday. Please clarify to reflect shift work requirements to support this effort.
Answer: Paragraph H.6 has been deleted in its entirety as stated in amendment 1 posted on FEDBIZOPS. The shift schedule is anticipated but subject to change as such: Shift 1: 6:00 AM - 6:00 PM Shift 2: 6:00 PM ? 6:00 AM

Question: Paragraph 13.0 of the RFP indicates that travel may be required to support his effort. Will the government identify a T&M CLIN to support this requirement?
Answer: A total of 500 anticipated hours in the event of a national emergency is set up.Travel is an anticipated at a total cost of $2,000.00 per contract year. Long distance travel to TSA?s COOP facility may be reimbursed following Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) and as approved by the CO and / pr COTR in advance. Local travel remains unauthorized. Said CLIN 	will be added to any resultant contract.

Question: Paragraph 9.0 of SOW states Education & Experience for Watch as ?2+ Years of College, Associates degree or equivalent skills, training, and 2+ Years organizational support and project experience.? Would like to confirm that training and experience can be substituted for education?
Answer: Yes training and experience can be substituted.

Question: Without information regarding the planned shift schedule, it is impossible to determine how many hours are required to support this effort.  Can you provide an estimate of the number of hours required per Watch Stander to support this effort on an annual basis?
Answer: The shift schedule is anticipated but subject to change as such: Shift 1: 6:00 AM - 6:00 PM Shift 2: 6:00 PM ? 6:00 AM

<CONTACT>Jonathan Jewel Contracting Specialist, Intern Fax: 440-838-6052
<DESC>Answers to Technical Questions The purpose of this amendment is to address technical question regarding the combine synopsis.  This does not extend any dates contained in the VA-541-07-RP-0093B.  The closing date still remains 2/06/2007. Q1. Bid specs mention various Inpatient and Outpatient facilities. Most major hospital systems often have two pricing sets when that is the case. Is that so with this job? That's fine if it is, we just need to know. Our software automatically handles that issue, but you will find that most other inventory services do not account for this difference. It would be an &quot;odd&quot; concept for them to deal with - that the same NDC can have a different cost based on where it is sitting.  A1.  All drug prices are the same irrespective of location or pharmacy type Q2.  We would assume that except for a dual IP/OP pricing structure, that the ENTIRE hospital system outlined in the bid spec's will use the SAME pricing. In other words, Cleveland, Dayton and Cincinnati would all have the same IP price or the same OP price for the same drug. Is that correct?  A2.  All should have the same price for the same drug Q3.  Do the inpatient facilities have multiple clinics or locations within them which need counting or is everything concentrated in a main pharmacy? For example, most all hospitals have a surgery satellite pharmacy, and some have quite a few others. This impacts the count time. A3. Only items in the pharmacies will be counted.&#160; Items on wards or clinics will not.&#160; This was all clearly spelled out in the solicitation  Q4.  Do the outpatient facilities have &quot;front ends&quot;, i.e. all the OTC stuff you would see in a small drugstore?  A4.  All items in all pharmacies are prescription only.&#160; OTC items are also considered prescription only.&#160; Nothing is "sold" to veterans directly - it is all dispensed on prescription or order Q5.  Regarding the various types of pharmacy automation: the bid spec's mention that data will provided for the counts in those areas, which is great. But, at a minimum, the data must contain the following elements in order for us to quickly process the information:  NDC Brief description Count, and notify us if liquids/solids are expressed in ml/gm's - preferably telling us how big a container it came out of.  The NDC is the big issue here because when we were trying to bid out a variety of VA facilities a couple of years ago, most said they could not tie an NDC to a drug listing. With the volume of data this job would entail, QIS simply would not have enough time to &quot;lookup&quot; the NDC's based on the other info on a report. I do know from past experience that the ScriptPro, Autoscript and sometimes the Baker cells can produce a report with all the necessary information. I am not familiar with the OS-PAC, Parata or Safety Pak 350 equipment, so I don't know what is available from their software. A5.  Some facilities may be able to provide specific NDC numbers, some may not; however all will provide a drug description.&#160; Only tablets and capsules are dispensed from automation, so liquid measures aren't needed Q6.  Basically, the same issue exists for Controlled Substance areas - we need a certain set of info on those lists in order to process the data on a timely basis.  A6.  See # 5, except liquid measures are used on a few items Q7.  For all items already placed in &quot;bingo cards&quot; or other med-packs ready for distribution, if they are to be counted, they also need an NDC number to enter.  A7.  That is facility specific; however, I believe only Cincinnati uses multi-dose cards for one Long-term Care satellite Q8.  On a job with this much travel between facilities, and each location being an &quot;unknown quantity&quot; in terms of how many people it will take to count or how long the count will take, we would need to ask for some flexibility on the hours. I know no one wants to pay overtime, but if we're still working somewhere we can't just walk out the door at 4:30 p.m. Someone will need to stay with us as we wrap things up. A8.   Overtime for inventory is not available.&#160; Inventory must be completed during business hours. Q9.  Counting bulk IV products is no problem, but most hospitals have a separate pricing list for those. If that's true for these facilities, that pricing list, including the NDC, cost and package size needs to furnished to us. (Along with any other drugs that are on direct purchase, making the McKesson price incorrect.) A9.   Prices for bulk IVC solutions and the few other drugs purchased from sources other than McKesson will be provided; however, they will probably have to be looked up on a per-item basis. Q10.  McKesson pricing files need to be provided no later than 30 days prior to the inventory dates. If we get that far I can give you the contact name at McKesson in KC who generates files for us here for the HCA hospitals. If the Cleveland rep just duplicates what Diane does in KC, we will be fine.  A10.  We are already inside the 30 day time frame you require.&#160; Inventory must be completed in February Q11.  Counting standards: estimating open bulk bottles to the nearest 1/10th is fine. We do it all the time.  We apply a similar concept to UD dump bins. We count the strips of 10 and estimate the loose pills rolling around in the bottom of the bin. A11.   You are not required to count items in UD bins - only those in bottles.&#160; The amount in UD bins costs more to count than the inventory is worth. Q12.  We don't usually count prosthetic items, but if you already have a numbering system established for identification we can probably work with that. Would just need to be a topic of discussion prior to inventory. A12.  Prosthetic items (expendable surgical supplies, dressings, catheters, etc) must be counted.&#160; Nomenclature, and possible dispense units, may vary among facilities All terms and conditions remain the same.
