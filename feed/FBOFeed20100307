<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>312 N. SPRING STREET, LOS ANGELES:<br /></strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>To assist Offerors' understand the difference between "Project 4A" versus it's alternate, "Project 4B", the following general description is provided:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>"Project 4A"</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">A common actuator will control both hot and cold deck dampers. So if a multizone unit has 7 zones then we will have 7 new damper actuators.<br /><br />We will not be changing any dampers. Existing cold and hot deck dampers are connected by a common linkage and will remain unchanged.<br /><br />New VFD will be installed and VFD speed will be controlled based on zone temperature feedback.<br /><br />NO static pressure sensors will be installed.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>"Project 4B"</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Two new and separate electric damper actuators and dampers will be installed for each zone, one for the hot deck and one for the cold deck. Each zone of the multizone unit shall have new dampers and actuators on hot and cold deck. So if a multizone unit has 7 zones then we will have 14 new damper actuators and 14 new dampers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New VFD will installed and VFD speed will be controlled based on feedback from new duct static pressure sensors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Two new static pressure sensors for each air handler will be installed; one located immediately downstream of the air handler cooling coil and one immediately downstream of the air handler heating coil. The VFD speed will be modulated to maintain the duct static pressure set point of the deck that requires the most air.</p>

<strong>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
FOR ALL BUILDINGS:<br />
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL SITES</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Offerors are reminded that instructions for submission of proposals are contained in the Solicitation document. This itemizes what needs to be submitted, and also gives the criteria by which proposals will be evaluated. Offerors are also reminded to include with their offers an acknowledgement of all amendments posted to FBO.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Revised Agreement and Solicitation documents are posted. The only changes to the Agreement are to add CLINs for the 312 N. Spring cooling coil replacement (new CLIN 1K); revised CLIN 1D to reflect "Project 4A" rather than "Project 4"; add new CLIN 1D1 as an alternate to 1C for "Project 4B"; added a new CLIN 1C1 for a unit price for VAV boxes under CLIN 1C ("Project 3); and added a new CLIN 1F1 for a unit price for VAV boxes under CLIN 1F ("Project 6"). Offers should also note that in the Scope of Work &amp; Concept Designs document (February 25 revision), the "Project 4B" alternate is out of order and is found at the end of the document. The only change to the Solicitation is to adjust the total evaluated price formula to account for the 1C1 and 1F1 unit prices.<br /><br />2. Revised SF 1442 &nbsp;to reflect these changes.</p>
