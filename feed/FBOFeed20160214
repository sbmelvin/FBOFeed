The Contractor shall provide inventory data to the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Unit. This data will be collected from predetermined urban forest inventory plots randomly located across the urban areas of Kansas City, St. Louis, and Springfield, Missouri. The protocols for this effort, including the inventory plot design, are outlined and described in the "Forest Inventory and Analysis National Urban FIA Plot Field Guide; Volume 1: Field Data Collection Procedures for Urban FIA Plots, Version 7.0" (commonly referred to as the "NRS Urban FIA Plots Field Guide"). The current version of the "NRS Urban FIA Field Guide" serves as a reference document or instruction manual for the life of the contract and is subject to change in the option periods.
<p>The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12, Commercial Items, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; and Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. A Firm-Fixed-Price contract will be awarded to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the best value to the government.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be for approximately a six-month Base Period (from approximately April 4, 2016 to September 30, 2016); and four (4) five-month Option Periods from approximately:</p>

<p><br />The government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFP will be the best value to the government (best value trade-off). The award may be made to a superior offeror which is not the lowest offered price, but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of a higher price. The evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance are: Factor 1 - Experience and Qualifications of Contractor and Key Personnel; Factor 2 - Past Performance; Factor 3 - Capability to Perform; and Factor 4 - Cost. Factors 1 and 2 are of equal weighting; Factors 1, 2, and 3 are significantly more important than price; however price will contribute substantially to the selection decision.
