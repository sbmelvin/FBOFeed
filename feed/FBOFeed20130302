<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</strong></p>
<p>MASTER PLAN within NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK SITE; GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Lead Planning, Architecture, and Engineering Services (PAE); SOLICITATION: GS11P13MKC0029; REGION: National Capital Region, Washington, DC.; CONTRACTING OFFICER: Mary E. Pineda, (202) 205-8468; CONTRACTING SPECIALIST: Nick Carroll, (202) 205- 0757; PROJECT TYPE:&nbsp; Master Plan (including a Campus Development Plan, Environmental Impact Statement, Cultural Resources Evaluation, and Transportation Management Plan); BUILDING TYPE:&nbsp;Adaptive reuse and new construction within a national historic landmark site; CLIENT AGENCY: U.S. Department of State; <em><strong>REVISED 2/24/2013</strong>&nbsp; </em><em>BUDGET:&nbsp; The total cost should range between $2,000,000 to $2,500,000</em>; GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:&nbsp; Nationwide, THIS PROCUREMENT IS OPEN TO SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESS (SEE SUBCONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER STAGE II HEREIN)</p>
<p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), in partnership with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Master Planning for the Potomac Hill Diplomatic Center (PHDC), a historic federal campus in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of downtown Washington, DC. This solicitation represents Stage I of a two-stage Design Excellence Program solicitation process.</p>
<p>GSA's Design Excellence Program was instituted to secure top-quality design talent and has led to the development of exceptional achievements in federal workspace development throughout the nation. The program stresses creativity. It also streamlines the way GSA hires Planning, Architecture, and Engineering (PAE) Firms, substantially cutting the cost of competing for GSA contracts.</p>
<p>The Design Excellence Program operates through GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS). PBS directs the federal government's multibillion-dollar building program, which includes construction, renovation, alteration, and repair of federal office buildings, courthouses, and other facilities. Most of GSA's work is in partnership with PAE groups from the private sector.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br /></strong>The scope of work for PHDC Master Plan requires, at minimum, the successful completion (including regulatory agency approval) of all components required for a multiple scenario Campus Development Plan; Cultural Resources Evaluation (pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act); Environmental Impact Statement (pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act); and Transportation Management Plan (pursuant to the policies of the National Capital Planning Commission). The plan is also to include GSA and DOS design standards for secure facilities. <em><strong>REVISED 2/24/2013 </strong>The contract will range in value from $2,000,000 to $2,500,000.</em></p>
<p>PHDC is located at 2300 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037. The site consists of two adjoining federally owned parcels, the Navy Hill and Potomac Annex properties (NOTE: Site Drawing attached herein under&nbsp;ATTACHMENT A - SITE DRAWING). Together, these properties compose a single, 11.8-acre campus that was deeded to the federal government in the 1790s. The site is home to the first Naval Observatory and the original headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mid-19th and early 20th Century buildings populate the campus today, which is bound by 23rd Street, NW to the east; the U.S. Institute of Peace property to the south; and the E Street, NW off ramp of the E Street Expressway to the west and north.</p>
<p>With DOS headquarters (2201 C Street, NW) and the U.S. Institute of Peace (2301 Constitution Avenue, NW) immediately adjacent to the site, and DOS'sneed for additional federally owned office space, GSA is currently working with DOS to transform the Potomac Annex and Navy Hill properties into a single, state-of-the-art federal campus, where history meets innovation and modernization. The campus is envisioned to serve the long-term needs of DOS and minimize the agency's real estate expenses by transitioning employees now housed in private office buildings to this federally owned site. The exact number of employees to relocate will depend on the development potential of PHDC as determined through the planning process. Therefore, a major objective of this project will be to develop a Master Plan that maximizes the full development potential of the site while meeting all regulatory obligations and Design Excellence Program standards.</p>
<p>There are eight existing office buildings located throughout the campus (three currently occupied by DOS and five vacant that are now undergoing renovation) and portions of open space that may be suitable for future development. The PHDC Master Plan will address the needs of GSA and DOS through phased development of PHDC and will turn upon such items as usable land areas, appropriate densities, highest and best use, and cultural, environmental, transportation, and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>The PHDC Master Plan will lay the foundation for the development of a world-class federal campus that preserves the cultural legacy of the site and responds to the development needs of the Government in the modern era and beyond. The campus should complement and contribute to surrounding public and private land uses and bring unity to the federal presence in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>PHDC is listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites and is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. The original Naval Observatory is already designated a National Historic Landmark. <br /><br /><strong>Scope of Services Overview<br /></strong>In general terms, the scope of services will include:</p>
