<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency(NGA), formerly the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, intends to extend the period of performance of the existing Computer to Plate (CTP) three year maintenance support contract, NMA100-01-C-0002, with Blanchard Systems Incorporated (BSI), New Orleans, LA, pursuant to authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  A base period of six months, plus options for up to an additional six months is planned.  CTP is a critical NGA system that provides Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based capabilities to scan and archive the reproduction material (repromat) used to support NGA printing operations and to process the digital repromat to create printing plates.  CTP is a film-less or non-photographic pre-press production process that eliminates the traditional pre-press task of manual negative engraving and photo lab work.  CTP provides the digital repromat to other NGA production systems, military commands, and foreign co-producers.  At a high level, the CTP performs the following functions: scanning, digital image assembly, color proofing, and image setting, in addition to the support functions of file archiving and production management.  Currently, CTP is transitioning server and archive functions to the Gateway Data Center.  This transition involves physically removing the Server and transferring 15 Terabytes of data.  Any critical malfunction could render the production system unusable, and destroy the information archive.  The extended period of performance will guarantee uninterrupted system support and continuity of operations while transitioning server and archive functions.  CTP integration and support requires approximately 18 months system-specific experience and a Top Secret/SCI accreditation.  ACCORDINGLY, THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Rather, interested parties are encouraged to submit evidence of their qualifications and/or capabilities to the identified point of contact within fifteen (15) calendar days of publication of this announcement.  Statements of qualifications and/or capabilities will be used for the purpose of accumulating a database of possible contractors for possible subcontracting opportunities and future procurement.  Submit all responses/inquiries in writing to the address or facsimile number stated herein to the attention of Linda O’Neil, Contract Specialist, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), 4600 Sangamore Road, Mail Stop D-88, Bethesda, MD 20816, or by email to oneilm@nga.mil, or by telephone facsimile to (301) 227.1461.  Responses must include your business name, point of contact, address, and telephone number with area code.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a sources sought notice for written information only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein. In preparation for an upcoming procurement, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA), Radiation Protection Division (RPD) is conducting market research to determine potential sources for services involving the demonstration of alternatives to radioactive devices  technology, using FAR Part 13 -- Simplified Acquisition Procedures. RPD is dedicated to minimizing incidences of lost radioactive sources that enter into consumer metal supplies and the public domain. Industrial devices and consumer products containing radioactive sources routinely fall out of  regulatory control. Once this occurs, these devices and products may be subjected to harsh conditions capable of producing a breached source, with the potential of harmful exposure incidents and significant economical impacts to industry. Under the proposed Purchase Order, the Contractor will  provide support to conduct outreach to facilitate market penetration and acceptance of the alternative technologies for radiography cameras chosen for funding.  This work will be accomplished by working with all stakeholders to address issues and concerns that may impede acceptance of the  alternative. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620, with a size standard of $6.0 million. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS. This is a request for interested potential offerors to submit a brief capability statement  demonstrating how they plan to meet the above requirement.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate an award of a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Applera Corporation, 301 Merritt 7, Norwalk, CT 06851-1070, to purchase one (1)  each, item number 4336701, Bigdye Terminator Kit.   The minimum specification / requirements of the terminator kit are: 1)  must result in the ability to generate high-fidelity sequence data (<1% ambiguous bases over 800 bp reads) using the ABI 3730 instrument; 2) Sequencing reagents must be capable of using cycle-sequencing protocols with high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios starting with minimal amounts (e.g., <100 ng) of starting DNA; 3) Consumables must be tailored for use on ABI 3730 instruments for performing DNA sequencing; and 4) They must not compromise the warranty or service contract of these instruments.  The noncompetitive determination is based upon the fact that the item is a registered trademark with ABI/Applera and is not distributed to any other sources.  The item will be used in mapping the DNA for the human genome.  The item is for use the government owned ABI DNA Sequencers and must be compatible to avoid equipment damage and to comply with the maintenance agreement number NPM12496 on sequencer Model 3730, S/N 1405-003.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 334516, Size Standard 500 Employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

The submission is due on January 9, 2006, 4:30 p.m. The submission must also include any prompt payment discount terms, the Dun & Bradstreet number (DUNs), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Offerors business size.  The Offeror must also register in the Government?s Contractor Registry System. Note: www.ccr.gov.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post additional information received in response to questions and answers submitted to USDA.

Question 1:  What are the quantities for products?  
Answer:  This is not an official requirement.  USDA is only seeking sources at this time for market research.  Offerors should include in their proposals a comparative price analysis of biobased versus nonbiobased products.  A unit price is sufficient.

Question 2:  What is a clam shell container?  
Answer:  A clam shell container is like the containers that are used by McDonalds and other franchises for hamburgers, salad and etc.  Normally, the lid and bottom are hinged together.  In our case, we are looking for containers that can carry cold foods such as salads, cold sandwiches and etc.  For example, these containers are typically made from cornstarch and are clear.  Other types of clam shells that handle hot foods are opaque in nature and can be made from fibers from sugarcane, corn and other fiberous materials.  

Question 3:  What types of biobased products are desired?
Answer:  All products must be biodegradeable/compostable.

The above Contract was awarded to MSD, Inc. on a full and open competition basis on March 27, 2001 and the estimated completion date is July 31, 2006. The current total estimated contract amount is USD$ 34,018,052.

USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70 (b)(5), where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays.

This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement in accordance with numbered note 22.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML #6002. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-06 dated 10/31/05. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase 90(ninety) custom chips from Affymetrix. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.  RML processes the chips in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place at Frederick, MD. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six(6)weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: (B)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation; 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors  Commercial; FAR52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders  Commercial Items.

A Certified Professional Estimator is acceptable as a senior cost engineer if they have been certified by AACE, ICEC or PCEA and are also registered as a professional engineer or architect. 2.	Considering the geographical constraint of personally reviewing the document, request you provide the following details before we buy the document: a.	List of Items, Schedule of Requirements, Scope of Work, Terms of Reference, Bill of Materials required. b.	Soft Copy of the Tender Document through email. c.	Names of countries that will be eligible to participate in this tender. d.	Information about the Tendering Procedure and Guidelines. All information needed to compete for this procurement is available through the synopsis on the FedBizOpps.  If the questioner has any further interest in the general mission and functions of the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, the website is as follows: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ and/or https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/.  3.	In reference to the solicitation for A&E services, we were informed that the ACASS System was abolished on October 5, 2005, and was replaced with the DUNS System.  What is the status of the ACASS System and will the DUNS number suffice for the requested  location? The ACASS number has been replaced by the DUNS number, as of October 5, 2005.  Any request for the ACASS number should refer to the DUNS number.  The former ACASS number is no longer used, nor maintained, by the modernized ACASS system.  A search for the p erformance history of A-E firms is now based on the DUNS number, rather than the ACASS number.  This change applies to all systems supplying information about A-E firms, including, but not limited to: The Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIR S), http://www.ppirs.gov and The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), http://cpars.navy.mil/acassmain.htm.  4.	Is this a new opportunity or a re-competition?  If it is a re-competition, could you provide the incumbent name and contract award number? This is a new opportunity.  As such, there is no incumbent name or contract award number.  5.	If there is no small business set-aside for this solicitation, why does it have a size standard listed? The size standard is to provide the small business size classification for potential subcontracting measures.  Due to the nature of the acquisition and the possibilities for subcontracting to small businesses, the prime contractor will be aware of the size  standard for determining if a business is classified as a small business. 6.	Submission of five copies of the response is required.  Does the USACE Huntsville Center wish for the copies to be bound or unbound, in a 3-ring binder, or is there no particular preference? Huntsville Center prefers that the copies are bound; however, there is no preference on the type of binding.

1.	Is there web-based training for the present EDW?  If so, who developed it?

2.	Would the Government grant a one-week extension of the due date?
