INTRODUCTION
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), within the Department of Transportation (DOT), has responsibility for the regulation of hazardous materials transportation by highway, rail, air, water and pipeline.  PHMSA is the primary federal regulatory agency responsible for ensuring that the Nation's 2.3 million miles of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines are safe, reliable, and environmentally sound.  From the federal level, we oversee the development, implementation and enforcement of regulations concerning pipeline construction, maintenance and operation, and we share these responsibilities with our state regulatory partners.  The rules governing pipeline safety are included in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 190-199.  Individual states may have additional or more stringent pipeline safety regulations.

The nation's pipelines are a transportation system that enables the safe movement of extraordinary quantities of energy products to industry and consumers, literally fueling our economy and way of life. The arteries of the Nation's energy infrastructure, as well as the safest and least costly ways to transport energy products, our oil and gas pipelines provide the resources needed for national defense, heat and cool our homes, generate power for business and fuel an unparalleled transportation system.

Over the past several years, PHMSA has strengthened its role in assuring the safety of the nation’s pipeline system in numerous ways, including promulgating new regulations on integrity management (IM).  These new regulations, together with the new inspection processes being used by regulators to evaluate operator compliance, rely for their effectiveness on the operators’ access to new technologies that support improved safety and integrity performance and on regulators’ access to information on the appropriate use and limitations of these technologies.

Please visit http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/ for a full description of PHMSA’s various pipeline safety programs and how this contract may support many of these vital safety initiatives.

REQUIREMENT
PHMSA uses a variety of contractor support to address ongoing and new challenges for its IM mission.  Integrity management decision makers within PHMSA require current, accurate and streamlined knowledge to address growing challenges.  These services are considered on demand and in the form of technical reports, briefs, white papers, PowerPoint slideshows and physical travel to attend and execute requested support.  This service contractor will coordinate and work extensively with other PHMSA contractors.  This coordination will make use of services those contractors provide to PHMSA such as but not limited to industry performance and IM data and webpage development.  Very limited Information Technology (IT) development and management is anticipated.

The support structure is divided into three program areas.  Each area is divided into tasks that are in support of the PHMSA pipeline safety mission.  Program Area 1 has recurring and annual needs and Program Areas 2 & 3 are infrequent and periodic in nature.  Annual needs are indicated below.  Please view the program and task statements of work for more detailed scope descriptions.

PROGRAM AREA 1 – CREATING AND PROMOTING INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE
Introduction:  The contractor must provide necessary technical, management, and administrative services to support PHMSA in creating and promoting knowledge to IM decision makers.  This initiative is intended to increase PHMSA and multiple pipeline stakeholder awareness of new technology, effectiveness of consensus standards incorporated into Parts 192-195 of PHMSA’s regulatory program and to organize and hold some of PHMSA’s public events and growing need in assessing quality from multiple program outputs.

Task 1A – Tracking and reporting developments in new technology (annual/reoccurring)
•	Working with multiple research programs in government and industry to identify and track existing technology and ones under development which prevents damage, detects leaks and damage, characterizes damage severity and expedites repair and remediation of damage;
•	Collecting information from relevant government agencies and trade organizations associated with the pipeline industry to understand confidence levels and perspectives with existing technology and ones under development;
•	Investigating technology solutions used in other facets of the energy industry such as down hole in within petrochemical refineries; and
•	Identifying government agencies and trade organizations associated with other industries to find technological solutions applicable to the pipeline industry and illustrate the path to implement.

Task 1B – Addressing the competency and effectiveness of consensus standards and industry guidelines for existing and emerging issues (annual/reoccurring)
•	Working with multiple national consensus standard developing organizations (SDO) to identify and track the continued relevance of consensus standards incorporated by reference in Parts 192-195 of PHMSA’s pipeline regulatory program.  Determining when critical revisions or when new standards are needed is important with ever changing social economic perceptions and technological improvements;
•	Coordination with the Pipeline Standards-Developing Organizations Coordinating Council (PSDOCC) which meets periodically to track SDO revision cycles and the necessity to revise or create new standards; and
•	Provide annual reporting to PHMSA leadership on the number of SDOs and standards incorporated by reference into Parts 192-195 both by in part or in whole, the revision cycle of these incorporated standards and all SDO coordination activities associated with Task 1-B.  In addition, a portion of this report should convey updates from multiple research programs and how they are influencing and strengthening standards.

Task 1C – Organizing and executing public events and peer reviews (annual/recurring)
•	Provide the organizational leadership to pull together agendas, prepare handouts, find and secure hotels and in some cases moderate some of PHMSA’s public technical or research events; and
•	Provide the organizational leadership to identify and secure relevant, independent and balanced peer review panelists.  These panelists may review multiple PHMSA program and in some cases outputs from this service contract in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines for quality.  Pub. Law. No. 106-554-515(a) and the OMB bulletin “Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review” proscribe the manner in which Federal agencies must ensure and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of public information.

PROGRAM AREA 2 – CROSS BORDER AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUES AND FRONTIER REGION ASSESSMENTS 
Introduction:  PHMSA’s cross border coordination is growing through a recent MOU/Arrangement with the Canadian National Energy Board. Understanding and quantifying differences between North American pipeline operations is important before an implementation strategy is created for harmonizing IM inspections and audits and consistent application of consensus standards.  Many challenges also exist in frontier regions where identification and quantification of information to PHMSA decision makers is greatly desired.

Task 2A – Assessing regulatory, technical and consensus standards issues between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico
•	Provide reports comparing regulatory programs, technical issues and consensus standards on North American cross border pipelines and possibly in other international regions;
•	Work with standard developing organizations and North American regulators to disseminate findings; and
•	Provide organizational leadership with these groups on PHMSA’s behalf so standards are consistently applied on cross border pipelines.

Task 2B – Assessing regulatory, technical and consensus standard issues for frontier regions such as the Outer Continental Shelf and the Arctic
•	Provide reports addressing regulatory, technical issues and consensus standards on offshore pipelines; and
•	Provide reports addressing regulatory, technical issues and consensus standards on pipelines in the Arctic.

PROGRAM AREA 3 – TECHNICAL SUPPORT DURING PIPELINE EMERGENCIES 
Introduction:  Major pipeline failures and natural disasters can occur.  In the time immediately following these events, PHMSA requires significant attention to technical and regulatory detail so appropriate corrective action orders are generated rapidly.  In some cases, on site collection of technical and photo details is required so mission critical actions are not delayed.

Task 3A – On site information collection and situation assessment during major pipeline failures
•	Within 72 hours or within the appropriate agreed time following a pipeline incident deemed major by PHMSA, travel and report to the affected area; and
•	Provide predetermined photo evidence and engineering/technical information collection as deemed relevant and directed by PHMSA and in report form.

Task 3B - On site information collection and situation assessment during natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods
•	Within 72 hours or within the appropriate agreed time following a natural disaster deemed major by PHMSA and relevant to pipeline matters, travel and report to the affected area; and
•	Provide predetermined photo evidence and engineering/technical information collection as deemed relevant and directed by PHMSA and in report form.

REQUIRED AREAS OF EXPERTISE
The contractor must provide a designated lead and, where appropriate, additional staff for each task. The task leader and additional staff must have the appropriate knowledge, skills and abilities to bring specified PHMSA support to satisfactory completion.  Specifics of the depth and range of expertise is required for each area:

•	Demonstrated petroleum engineering experience and or special emphasis on oil and gas pipeline operations;
•	Documented knowledge of and experience using U.S. Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 190, 191-192, 193, 194, 195, 198 and 199 
•	Documented knowledge of and experience using the various consensus standards applied in the oil and gas pipeline industry and incorporated in the pipeline safety regulations.  These include but are not limited to standards addressing design, construction, integrity management and pipeline operations;
•	Documented knowledge of and experience addressing various internal and externally applied technologies applied in the oil and gas pipeline industry;
•	Documented knowledge of and experience using direct assessment processes and protocols; and
•	Demonstrated public speaking experience, leading diverse groups and strong writing skills.

GOVERNMENT COST ESTIMATE
The total estimated cost and hours associated with these services range from $200k to $400k and 2,000 hr to 4,000 hr per year.  Area 1 contains services which are anticipated as annual/recurring in nature and services in Area 2 & 3 are periodic and infrequent.

<p>Name Brand Justification for Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter and the 715 LCD Display</p>
<p>&#61656; The Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G is the standard pressure based primary water level measurement sensors used at CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic coast below the Mason-Dixon Line, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and throughout the Pacific. Implementing different sensors in place of the current sensors will result in additional cost and resources. Also, there will be resulting delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment.</p>
<p>&#61656; Under the current CO-OPS operating system any environmental monitoring sensor that has not been previously approved must be subjected to a series of tests to ensure the quality of the data produced by that sensor and the durability of that sensor for the intended use. These tests usually include bench testing using controlled conditions and physical measurement, controlled environmental testing to check a sensor's reliability under different conditions, and long term comparison testing with accepted sensors at multiple real world locations. These tests and the analysis of the resulting data take a large amount of time, money, and resources to conduct.</p>
<p>&#61656; These Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G is tied to a series of data collection software and existing infrastructure and are replacements in kind due to a high consumable rate as a result of where they are positioned on piers, buoys, etc.</p>
<p>&#61656; CO-OPS stations are designed for optimal performance of the Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G. A change of sensor type will result in a need to redesign the existing stations to accommodate the new sensor.</p>
<p>&#61656; CO-OPS cannot risk the possibility of new mounting hardware to be developed and purchased to mount a new sensor.</p>
<p>&#61656; The data collection platforms at CO-OPS stations are programmed to collect data from the Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G. If a new sensor is implemented additional cost for software development will be required.</p>
<p>&#61656; Currently CO-OPS field personal and contractors are trained in the use and maintenance of the Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G. Additional cost will incur from having to train field personal and contractors on the use and maintenance of a new sensor.</p>
<p>&#61656; Using another type of sensor will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple sensor types in a given region.</p>
<p>&#61656; CO-OPS also has the ability and necessary equipment to calibrate and repair the Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitter model 6000-30G. If a new sensor is implemented new equipment for that sensor will need to be purchased and training will be needed for those tasked with this duty. The Paroscientific model 715 LCD Display is being purchased to further support calibration and repair of the existing Paroscientific Digiquartz&reg; Intelligent Transmitters.</p>

AMA POSSESSES THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE, EXPERTISE AND LEADERSHIP IN CONVENING CROSS-SECTOR DISCUSSIONS AND THE ABILITY TO INCREASE COMMUNITY LEVEL AWARENESS OF PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE.

Project Title
American Medical Association (AMA) Third National Congress

Background
The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) of 2006 authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award cooperative agreements to eligible entities to improve surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness for public health emergencies.  
The mission of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is to lead the Nation in preventing, preparing for, and responding to the adverse health effects of public health emergencies and disasters.  To accomplish its mission, ASPR collaborates with its stakeholders, including other HHS programs; other Federal agencies; State, local, Tribal, and international officials; and the private healthcare sector. This initiative is in direct response to and support of the Office of Preparedness and Emergency Operations (OPEO) and ASPR mission by enhancing community preparedness and readiness through strengthened linkages between healthcare and public health leaders and planning for response to acts of terrorism and other public health and medical threats and emergencies. 

Scope
As part of ASPR, OPEO has the responsibility of serving as a catalyst in the engagement of Federal, State, and local governments, the private sector, academia, and appropriate professional societies in the community-wide planning, establishing a prototype of community readiness, and improving the integration of healthcare and public health leadership at the community level. While there are many governmental agencies and private organizations charged with ensuring the Nation’s capacity to prevent and respond to catastrophic events, each having a critical function in prevention and response efforts, it is vital to bring public health and healthcare delivery sectors together to improve preparedness at the community level.  Preparedness and response efforts must be coordinated at all levels to ensure optimal outcomes in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and impact. Unfortunately, venues that bring community level stakeholders together with Federal, state, and local government, the private sector, academia, and professional associations to discuss community level strategies for undertaking and overcoming barriers and challenges to preparedness planning, specifically in terms of medical surge capacity, community mitigation strategies, models of emergency healthcare delivery, alternative care sites, maintenance of  critical community infrastructure, legal and regulatory policy, workforce education and safety, community education/communication-especially vulnerable populations, and the role of the business community/private sector are limited and additional efforts are needed to increase opportunities for communication, coordination, collaboration and integration between these stakeholders.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 27 AUG, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about 14 SEP 30, 2008. Contact Danny Sawyer at Danny.R.Sawyer@uscg.mil or 252-335-6561 for questions regarding this solicitation.
