<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) will be synopsizing for a modification to BOA N00383-12-G-008F to add 2 repair items to the BOA for the E-2D platform.
Lockheed Martin Corporation (03640) is located in Owego, NY and is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
 Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 
https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer.
 Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<SUBJECT>Convergent Network and Telecommunications Services for U.S. Mission Canada
<SOLNBR>SAQMMA-15-RFI-CanadaTelecom
<RESPDATE>060115
<CONTACT>Andrew J. Lloyd, Email lloydaj@state.gov - Kenneth G. Dougherty, Contract Specialist (contractor), Email DoughertyKG@State.Gov
<DESC><strong>**For full information see attachment titled "RFI for Convergent Network and Telecommunications Services"**</strong>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.0 Purpose </span></p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as outlined in FAR 15.201(c)(7). The purpose of this RFI is to accomplish market research pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, and to identify vendors capable of performing the functions described herein. The Government is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of attracting new telecommunication service providers to support the requirements of the U.S. Mission Canada as described in this RFI. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment on the part of the Government to conduct a solicitation for the below-listed services in the future. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, nor will it compensate respondents for any costs incurred in the development/furnishing of a response. The Government will not entertain telephone calls or questions for this RFI. Please note that a decision not to submit a response to this RFI will not preclude a vendor from participating in any future solicitation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.0 Background and Statement of Need </span></p>
<p>The U.S. Mission in Canada consists of a medium-sized embassy located in Ottawa and seven consulate locations (Halifax, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver).  The goal of this RFI is to identify businesses with the capability to maintain and expand the current Multi-Protocol Layered Switching (MPLS) network, to include additional sites and services now being provided separately.  These additional services include Integrated Services Digital Network(ISDN) Primary Rate Interface (PRI) circuits, analog fax lines, DSL internet data lines, analog voice lines, and Direct Inward Dialing (DID) extensions. The current MPLS convergent network consists of an IP-based private cloud linking the Embassy and all Consulate locations and providing voice, data and video conferencing over a single mesh network.</p>
<p>The proposed solution for US Mission Canada is to implement a fully integrated MPLS (Layer 3) private network while optimizing security and minimizing costs over traditional telecommunication services.  The proposed solution for the MPLS component shall utilize a Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) service which allows for remote site connectivity of customer IP networks.  US Mission Canada intends to use the same set of private IP addresses currently in use and will be provided to the carrier at the time of project implementation.  The traffic for each customer (US Mission Canada service location) shall be separated from each other over the same physical backbone. Traffic separation means that each customer cannot access another customer's network.</p>
<p>In order to maximize performance, innovation and competition, this contract will utilize the Performance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA) strategy. PBSA emphasizes that all aspects of an acquisition be structured around the purpose of the work to be performed as opposed to the manner in which the work is to be performed. It is designed to ensure that contractors are given freedom to determine how to meet the Government's performance objectives, which appropriate performance quality levels are achieved, and payment is made only for services that meet these levels. For more information see Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 37.6 (Performance-Based Acquisition).</p>
