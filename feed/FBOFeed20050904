<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR) located in Beaufort NC, is experiencing inefficiencies in their internet communication system particularly during peak hours when there are very large data transfers.  This is resulting in negative impact on mission critical operations.  Current service has become inadequate to meet the needs of the Lab and “work arounds” are becoming more frequent and costly. The Center has a need to upgrade communication services to 10MB capability.  CCFHR’s remote location proposes challenges when obtaining cost effective communication solutions. These deficiencies can be resolved with establishing a dedicated 10 Mb circuit from Beaufort to Morehead City NC with MCNC.  CCFHR can share an existing DS3 circuit located at NC State University’s Center of Marine Sciences and Technology, Morehead City campus which is supported by the MCNC organization NC Research and Education Network (NCREN) internet 2 network.  Through NCREN, MCNC provides high-speed internet, video, audio, data and computing services to universities and other institutions.  NCREN is the backbone for building the North Carolina Statewide Grid and supporting future technology growth.  To obtain the service in Morehead City, placement of a dedicated service from Beaufort NC to Morehead City MC, NCREN circuit will be required.  CCFHR will be charged only for up to 10Mb of the service provided limiting the expense.  The service will be supported by required IT security components; compliment future NOAA network infrastructure initiatives; and will eliminate communication line costs for video conferencing once the equipment is upgraded.  There are no other known sources that can provide a partnership for shared high speed internet services in the Beaufort or surrounding area.  MCNC is the only known source who can establish such a circuit and provide the services described herein.   For the reasons stated above the Government intends to issue a purchase order to MCNC to establish the circuit.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested firms shall provide the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a detailed information that demonstrates their capability and qualifications to provide the services described herein and the estimated price for doing such and estimated annual price for the service.  Submission must be faxed to Carey Marlow at 814-426-5067 or 816-426-7530. (Reference NCNS3000-5-00106). Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the following criteria:  1.  Demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide internet service using 10Mb dedicated circuit from Beaufort NC to Morehead City NC and 10Mb service via NCRE managed DS3; 2.  Demonstrated ability to provide service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with full operational support either via on-site assistance or pager access.  The applicable NAICS code is 541513.  All contractors doing business with the Government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  In order to register, firms must have a Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) number.  A D&B number may be acquired free of charge by contacting D&B on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requstOptions.html or phone 800-333-0505.
