<DESC>Description:   The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement to construct and complete Gilt Edge Mine Superfund Site, Phase 4, Ruby Gulch Waste Rock Repository and Cap, Operable Unit 3.  The objective of Phase 4 work is to complete the geomembrane cap system at the toe of Ruby Gulch.   The work includes: excavation and removal of the existing Ruby Pond impoundment at the toe of the Repository.  This impoundment is a geomembrane-lined pond which captures and provides temporary storage of acid rock drainage (ARD) which discharges from the Ruby Repository.  The pond geomembrane is approximately 10 years old and leaks.  Acid water leaking from the pond is captured and pumped back into the pond by a leak detection pump and by a downstream seepage cut-off wall and pumping system.  A new subsurface ARD storage vault and a new pond will be constructed.  The ARD vault is composed of a network of HDPE pipe and will require modification of the existing pump house.  Primary components of work include:: water for dust abatement, clearing and grubbing, stripping topsoil, removing water, earthwork, geotextile, geomembrane cover system, textured geomembrane pond liner, riprap, polyethylene pipe culverts, polyethylene drain pipe, relocating and reinstalling pump house, automating pump operations, and  Power lines in conduit. Since this is a Superfund site, prospective bidders are cautioned that the work requires compliance with CERCLA regulations.  The estimated price range for this construction work is $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. This acquisition is being offered for competition as a total small business set-aside, using Sealed Bidding Procedures.  A formal site visit which will include a question and answer period will be conducted on/or about July 12, 2005 in Deadwood, SD.   The specific date and time will be published in the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>30 -- Rectifier Transformers for the AGS Main Magnet Power Supply
<SOLNBR>AGSTXF1
<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) operates a fully controlled 72 MW DC power supply, which energizes the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) Main Ring Magnet system.  The Magnet system represents a 0.75 Henry, 0.25 Ohm load.  The controlled rectifier assembly is feed from a 95 MVA Motor Generator Set through eight phase shifting / step-down rectifier transformers.  The secondaries of each of these transformers are bifilar wound, so that there are 16 secondary windings in total.   BNL will solicit bids to replace the existing rectifier transformers with new units.  It is critically important that the prospective Vendor have extensive experience with rectifier transformer of this size and service and a thorough understanding of how these transformers interact with the Motor Generator set.  The prospective Vendor shall insure that the new Transformers are completely compatible with the existing rectifier modules and the Motor Generator Set.  The Vendor shall build and thoroughly test and document the transformers.  BNL will install the transformers with engineering supervision by the Vendor.  The Vendor shall participate in the commissioning and turn on of the systems after the new transformers are installed.

Operating Parameters:
The Transformers will be operated 24 hours per day 7 days per weeks 10 months per year.  The operating cycle will drive the rectifiers to full rectify and then to full invert continuously with a repetition rate of from 1 cycle per second to 1 cycle in 10 seconds.  During each cycle power will flow from the transformers to the magnet load and then from the magnet load back through the transformers to the Motor Generator Set.  In one typical cycle the DC current will rise from 200 amperes to 6000 amperes in 500 milliseconds and then immediately return to 200 amperes in an additional 500 milliseconds.  This cycle will repeat every 1.1 seconds.  In another cycle the current will rise from 200 amperes to 4500 amperes in 500 milliseconds and stay at 4500 amperes for 6 seconds and then return to 200 amperes in 500 milliseconds.  This cycle will repeat every 9 seconds.  The transformers must be designed and braced to handle this service, including the harmonics generated by the rectifier modules.  The transformers must fit the footprint of the existing transformers.  Any modifications required to the existing transformer yard will be prohibitively expensive.   

Specific requirements for the transformer are:
1)  		Eight phase-shifting / rectifier transformers each with bifilar secondary windings.  These transformers will be housed in four tanks suitable for outdoor service.
2)		Four transformers shall be rated at 7500 volt (input), 431 volt (output), 2.65 MVA.  These shall have appropriate phase shifting for 24 pulse rectifier operation.
3)		Four transformers shall be rated at 7500 volt (input), 2288 volt (output), 11.5 MVA.   These shall have appropriate phase shifting for 24 pulse rectifier operation.
4)      Four transformers will be connected via cable and four will be connected via circular aluminum bus.
5)		The lower power rated transformers will have no load manually selectable taps at 100%, 90% and 80 %.  These will be full current taps. 
4)       Delivery of the transformers shall be within 10 months after receipt of order.

This Request for Proposals (RFP)will be a Best Value with trade-offs procurement based upon price and other factors.

Introduction
1.1	Purpose

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is soliciting proposals under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to (i) consider new and commercially-available technologies and (ii) demonstrate a business case of an information service using these technologies to convey real-time parking availability [Smart Park] to truck drivers 24 hours per day, seven days per week. 

1.2    Overview

One or more offerors may be selected to receive an award (see Section 1.7) to carry out the demonstration project.  FMCSA reserves the right to negotiate the type of award. 
1.2	Background

FMCSA’s mission is to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks and motorcoaches.  Its goal is to reduce commercial motor vehicle-related fatalities to 1.65 fatalities per 100 million commercial motor vehicle miles traveled by 2008.  Driver fatigue is a known cause of fatal large truck crashes.  Contributing to fatigue is the lack of safe, available truck parking. 

In 1998, Congress directed the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to review causes of truck and bus crashes.  In a 2002 report, NTSB recommended that FMCSA create a guide to inform truck drivers about locations and availability of parking.  Congress further mandated a study on the adequacy of truck parking by the Federal Highway Administration. The 2002 study recommended the deployment of Intelligent Transportation Systems to provide commercial motor vehicle drivers with real-time information on the location and availability of parking spaces.  

Before preparing a proposal, prospective offerors should download and read “Intelligent Transportation Systems and Truck Parking”, available at http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safetyprogs/research/researchpubs.htm. They should also read the entire BAA. 
1.3	Offerors

A successful offeror will most likely be a team of three entities:  (i) a truck stop owner/operator (private or public sector), (ii) a government transportation agency (public sector) with jurisdiction over a highway and signage, and (iii) an organization with experience and expertise in parking management technology, including Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) (private or public sector).   

FMCSA encourages service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and women-owned small businesses.  It also encourages consultation with and/or partnership arrangements among small businesses, truck stop associations, nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations, educational and research institutions, and state and local government agencies.  One partner must serve as lead investigator.  Selected offeror(s) will be announced in fall 2005.  
1.4	Program Scope and Funding

FMCSA may choose to fund an entire proposal or only a portion of a proposal and will not pay for bid and proposal costs.  Total funding for this BAA is not to exceed $2,000,000, subject to availability.  These details do not impose any obligation on FMCSA or signify a firm intention to enter into a contract.  FMCSA may incrementally fund any awards under this BAA.
1.5	Period of Performance

The maximum period of performance is approximately 24 months.      
1.6	Independent Evaluation

The U.S. Department of Transportation will conduct an independent evaluation of the project and selected offeror(s) shall cooperate with the independent evaluators to ensure a mutually acceptable, successful evaluation.  
1.7	Type of Award

FMCSA is contemplating a cost-type contract award, but offerors may propose an alternate contract type.
1.8	Point of Contact for Technical Matters: 

Quon Y. Kwan
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (MC-RTT)
	e-mail:  quon.kwan@fmcsa.dot.gov

2	General Information
2.1	Eligibility
	
This BAA solicits proposals from all interested and qualified sources.  
2.2	Ethical Considerations

Certain post-employment restrictions on former federal officers and employees (including special Government employees) may apply.  All facts related to potential or existing conflicts of interest [see Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) section 9.5] must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action taken or proposed to take to avoid or mitigate such conflict.

2.3    Intellectual Property

Intellectual property consists of copyrights, patents, and certain types of databases, software, inventions, training manuals, systems design or other proprietary information in any form or medium.  Intellectual property rights shall be assigned in accord with the FAR:

FAR 52.227-14 (Rights in Data – General)
FAR 52.227-15 (Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software)
FAR 52.227-16 (Additional Data Requirements)

The FAR may be publicly accessed at www.arnet.gov/far/loadmainre.html. 

2.3	Report Requirements  

The number and types of reports and how they should be prepared and submitted will be specified in the award document.  Reports must include, as a minimum, Monthly Technical Progress, Monthly Funds Status, and a Final Report.    

2.4	Required Meetings

Attendance of the key personnel from the selected offeror(s) will be required at:

(i)	One Initial Kick-Off Meeting planned to be in Washington, DC, 30 days after contract award.  
(ii)	Review meetings, held by teleconference every three months.
(iii)	One Final Review/Demonstration meeting planned to be at the offeror’s or demonstration test site.  
2.5	Subcontracting  

Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 637(d)] requires small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses to be considered fairly as subcontractors to prime contractors under Government contracts.  Prime contractors and subcontractors must carry out this policy of fairness.  An offeror who includes subcontractors (i.e., partners) must submit a subcontracting plan in accord with FAR 19.702(a) (1) and (2).  The plan format is outlined in FAR 19.704.  
3	Preparation of Proposal
3.1	Volume I – Technical and Management Approach and Business Case

All proposals will be treated as competitive information and the contents will not be disclosed except for evaluation purposes.  No proposals will be returned.  The original proposal or a copy of such will be retained and all other copies destroyed.  Approximately 30 to 60 days after completing the evaluation, offerors will be notified in writing whether a proposal has been accepted.
3.1.1	Format

Offerors should mark the specific information subject to limited disclosure, as opposed to marking the entire document for limited disclosure.  Avoid markings like “Company Confidential” or other phrases that may be confused with national security classifications.  Use phrase, “SOURCE SELECTION INFORMATION – COMPETITION SENSITIVE – GOVERNMENT ONLY”, to indicate proprietary information.

Proposals must be on single-sided pages, written in English, with fonts no smaller than 12 point and with 1-inch margins (all four sides) on each page.  A page must be no larger than 8.5" by 11.0".  (Accordion-style foldouts count as multiple pages equivalent to the expanded size.)  Paper copies of proposals should be stapled or put in loose-leaf binder, not bound.  Five (5) sets of the proposal plus one (1) set in electronic format (IBM-PC formatted CD-ROM readable with Microsoft Office 2000 or Word 2002) shall be submitted to FMCSA for a total of six (6) sets.

Ledora Akanni, Contracting Officer
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
Office of Acquisitions Management (MC-MBA)
400 Virginia Ave., SW   3rd floor
Washington, DC  20024

Attn:  DTMC75-05-BAA-00001
4	Evaluation of Proposals
4.1	Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated against the following criteria:  

     a. 	   Technical Approach
     b. 	   Importance to FMCSA Programs 
     c.       Affordability
     d.       Cost Realism 
     e.       Management Team Approach 
     f.        Business Case and Ease of Commercialization/Widespread Deployment.  

The first four criteria (a. through d.) are in accord with FAR 35.016(e). 
4.1.1	Technical Approach  

 	There are two groups of factors that will be considered:  technology-related and test site-related.   The following technology-related factors will be considered:

•	Accuracy of the information on parking availability.
•	Reliability of the technology 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, in all weather conditions.
•	Extent of use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment.  If equipment is non-COTS, the criterion becomes a matter of how soon the equipment can be made COTS.
•	Conformance with the National ITS Architecture (see www.its.dot.gov/aconform/aconform.htm), any relevant regional architecture, and any standards. 
•	Ease of retrofit into an existing truck parking area.
•	Ability to receive parking availability information in real-time without adding equipment to a truck.
•	Expansion capability so as to provide information on parking availability at nearby truck parking locations.
•	Potential capability to track parking history and make parking reservations.
•	Transferability of the technology to other locations.  
	
The following test-site related factors will be considered:

•	Suitability of proposed test site(s): 
o	Whether there is documentation of (i) complaints about inadequate parking, (ii) need for truck appointment or reservation system, (iii) trucks illegally parked, or (iv) trucks queuing up to enter site(s).
o	Whether the test sites(s) involve at least one private truck stop and at least one public truck stop.	
•	Suitability of the technology for the test site, taking into account conditions such as truck traffic, terrain, and weather.
•	Suitability of the technology for conveying real-time parking information to trucks approaching within (i) 50 miles of, and (ii) one mile of the test site(s).
•	Extent to which proposal identifies risks, consequences, and mitigation. 



	
4.1.2	Importance to FMCSA Programs 

Understanding of the problems of parking availability and getting information on parking to truckers on the road and the relationship of the two problems to the FMCSA mission will be considered.  
4.1.3	Affordability

The proposed total program cost will be evaluated against funds available to determine affordability. 
4.1.4	Cost Realism 

Estimates of the capital costs (including installation) and annual maintenance/ operations costs of the technology will be evaluated as to realism and reasonableness.  Also, proposed total program cost will be evaluated as to realism and reasonableness.   

Cost realism and reasonableness are used to assess understanding of the effort as well as to evaluate the practicality of the technical and management approach. 
4.1.5	Management Team Approach 

The offeror will be evaluated with respect to past performance on government grants or contracts, extent of commitment of partners to the project, and viability of the management approach. 

The range, depth, and mix of expertise of the offeror’s key personnel will be evaluated to ensure they are qualified to carry out the project.   The availability of offeror’s key personnel, facilities, and equipment to this project is also a criterion.  
4.1.6	Business Case and Ease of Commercialization/Widespread Deployment 

The business case will be evaluated to determine sustainability of the technology beyond the demonstration.  In addition, there will be an evaluation of the ease with which the technology can be commercialized and deployed widely.

Relative Order of Importance: (i) Operational Effectiveness - Most important. (ii) Past Performance - Less important. Price - Evaluated, but not rated. Award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the government. In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall technical and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price. However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government m! ay accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations. FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (As of January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and ce! rtifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that co! ntains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 5! 2.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination... IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS: Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form. Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementin! g this statutory requirement. Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided. Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.

Only the latest version of VAPS and FLSIM will handle the added complexity of the displays needed for the controller tools.  The software offered by Engenuity is the only one of its kind that meets these requirements.  It would take substantial duplication of time and effort for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>NASA MSFC plans to purchase a time-triggered protocol (TTP) disturbance node, MMII physical layer, hub for MMII physical layer, and software upgrade from TTTech Computertechnik.     NASA MSFC plans to purchase this software upgrade from TTTech Computertechnik on a sole-source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b). Competition is impractical for the following reasons:   1.	The software upgrade is associated with hardware embedded within an existing development cluster, in which the company is the sole provider, that was previously purchased from TTTech under purchase order H36394D.  The aforementioned software has unique capabilities and is the only software available that will satisfy MSFC’s requirements for use in the advanced avionics architecture that may be developed into a flight system. 2.	Other products are available that meet critical factors of the project; however, it is not cost effective to purchase these items since they will have to be modified when received in order to meet compatibility requirements of the existing hardware.	Also, all revised software contains trade secrets and confidential information of TTTech.  This makes them uniquely qualified to perform the necessary technical support related to node development for application-specific systems for use in spacecraft. 3.	The hardware items are in-line unit replacements for current hardware purchased from TTTech under purchase order H36394D.  These units will replace daughter boards on circuit boards produced by TTTech and contain proprietary designs.  No other manufacturer may produce these units because interfaces to them are not made public. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 23, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer that shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The starting date for performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be 10/01/2005.  The RFP is anticipated to be an unrestricted full and open competition.  Please monitor           fedbizopp.gov          and         http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm        for future information. The RFP is anticipated to utilize the draft statement of work attached below:       	STATEMENT OF WORK HAZARDOUS WASTE METHODS SUPPORT I.	 BACKGROUND 	The regulations promulgated under Section 3001, Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) (40 CFR Parts 260 to 270) established the framework and the means by which to identify hazardous wastes.  These regulations include lists of wastes and characteristics of waste which have been identified as hazardous.  Once a solid waste is identified as hazardous, it is subject to control under Subtitle C of RCRA. 	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is continually involved in a variety of activities to support and expand the hazardous waste regulations.  The EPA is responsible for developing, supporting, and maintaining the hazardous waste identification and management systems for regulations under RCRA.  Specifically, EPA is responsible for method development and evaluation, quality assurance and control, regulatory actions related to the framework of the regulatory system, the regulations identifying hazardous waste, and other aspects of 40 CFR Parts 260 to 270. 	The Methods Team is the focal point within the EPA Office of Solid Waste (OSW) Economic, Methods and Risk Analysis Division (EMRAD) for expertise in analytical chemistry and hazardous waste characteristic testing methodologies, environmental sampling and monitoring, and quality assurance/quality control.  OSW plays a vital role in implementing the hazardous waste management and contaminated site cleanup programs under RCRA.  The Methods Team provides technical support to other OSW Divisions, EPA Program Offices and Regions, state regulatory agencies, and the regulated community. II.	 PURPOSE OF THE METHODS TEAM PROGRAM 	The purpose of the Methods Team program is as follows: 	 	develop and evaluate analytical and test methods to identify and characterize hazardous wastes, environmental samples and contaminated materials 	 	produce guidance documents and technical transfer programs to foster the development and use of innovative, cost-effective approaches (such as through Performance -Based Measurement Systems, PBMS) for waste and site characterization, monitoring and remediation 	 	analyze and interpret data from RCRA monitoring activities 	 	maintain "Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods, (SW-846)", a multi-volume manual of EPA-approved methods and monitoring guidance 	 	foster public outreach and communication regarding RCRA-related monitoring activities such as through the annual (NEMC) National Environmental Monitoring Conference (MICE) service line III.	 SCOPE 	The Contractor shall provide support services to the Methods Team program as delineated in this section. The Contracting officer will issue work assignments for all work products in a draft for review and approval by appropriate Government personnel prior to preparation and issuance as final, in accordance with terms and conditions of the contract.  The Government shall make all final policy and regulatory decisions resulting from contractor-provided advice and assistance under this contract.  Section IV provides detailed task descriptions. 	1.

NIST has owned this instrument since 1998.  Recent developments in ion-beam technology have resulted in the production of new primary ion guns.  One of the new developments is the Bi cluster source.  This ion source will allow NIST to perform better measurements on samples of interest, especially organic and biological samples that are of interest to the pharmaceutical and biomedical industries.

The ion source must be a Bi ion cluster source that is 100% compatible with the existing hardware, both physically and electronically.  

Sole source determination is based on the following:  ION-TOF, USA is the only source who can provide the upgrade to the existing instrument.  The existing instrument is a commercial item.  ION-TOF, USA developed the instrument and has proprietary rights to all hardware and software technology.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by June 28, 2005, will be considered by the Government.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this  synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with  preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not  constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor  does this issuance restrict the Government’s acquisition approach.  The  Government intends to issue a solicitation and award a contract for a base year  plus four option years.   If you have any questions, you may contact Lucas Jacobsen at (937) 257-6145 ext  4309, or lucas.jacobsen@wpafb.af.mil., or the Contracting Officer, Captain  Kelley Poree at (937) 257-6145 ext 4400, or kelley.poree@wpafb.af.mil.   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: Question 1: What will be the approximate level of effort?   Answer: Approximately 12-20 personnel Question 2:  What will the security clearance requirements be?   Answer: Many personnel will require secret security clearances. Question 3: What is meant by several of the terms on the sources sought  synopsis? Answers: Presentation preparation involves preparing charts, electronically.  Editing  them, reformatting them, and saving them on CDs and electronically.  Hard  copies will also be required - printed from the electronic charts.  There may  be graphs, pie charts, bar charts, etc that need to be prepared.     	As far as the System Interfacing, the government requires interfacing  with mostly government systems.     	For networking, the government requires the admin to be able to access  government systems using the government established computer websites.     	Program Management for the government means that we need a "Program  Manager" that must have experience with the management of contractor personnel.  The "Program Manager" would only supervise contractor, on-site personnel. The  program manager will act as a primary contact point between the government and  the contracting company and be available, either in person, or by phone, to  discuss any matters with a reasonable advanced notification.  In cases where  the "Program Manager" is not available an alternate person must be assigned and  the government notified.  Question 4:  How do you prefer to receive a capabilities packages? Answer:  Capabilities packages may be sent electronically or via hard copy  although both methods simultaneously is preferable. It is important to note that this synopsis is very brief purposely and will  eventually be followed by a detailed government solicitation.

It is the intention of the Department to award one or more of those contracts to a qualified small business. If more than three contracts are awarded, it is the intention of the Department to award at least two of those contracts to qualified small businesses.  Task Orders will be issued on a fixed rate labor hour or time and materials basis as appropriate.

The contract term shall cover a base period beginning the date of contract award through September 30, 2005 with five (5) option periods.  Option Period 5 will be extended to allow for a five year contract term, the period of which will be determined based on date of contract award.

The range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster or from concealment.  The ranges rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present (i.e., tactical move and shoot type drills where student/ instructor ratio would be too restrictive).  The range rules shall allow shooters to utilize weapons on fully automatic during drills.

	The estimated number days for range usage per quarter is 24 days.  The estimated number of rounds fired is 175,000 per quarter.

1.  Logistic services and support for CLDP long term advisors living abroad.  The Contractor shall provide pre-departure and arrival briefings, temporary housing arrangements, furnish housing and moving assistance and other related support services.

2.  Administrative Support Services:  Logistic support for CLDP short term advisors and foreign nationals participating in CLDP programs both in the US and in other countries.  The Contractor may be required to provide local administrative support, professional services and office equipment.

4.  Establish and staff field offices and provide all of the administrative and technical assistance and logistics support to manage these offices for CLDP.

BACKGROUND:

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), a U.S. Department of Commerce initiative funded in part by the U.S. Agency for International Development, is one component of the U.S. Government effort to support economic and political reforms underway around the globe.  CLDP provides training and consultative services to lawmakers, regulators, judges, lawyers and educators seeking assistance in the evaluation, revision and implementation of evolving legal systems.  Technical assistance is usually provided to designated countries through short-term and long-term U.S. experts (Advisors).  CLDP programs typically involve the placement of Advisors with host government ministries, as well as short-term in-country programs, such as conferences.

The incumbent contractor is Metrica, Inc., 10010 San Pedro, Suite 400, San Antonio, TX 78216.
CAPABILITIES: 

A prospective prime contractor must have relevant international experience providing the kinds of services described in this synopsis in various countries.  CLDP has a presence in the following areas: Asia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Also, the prime contractor must be fully capable to manage sub-contractors, and fund items and services as may be necessary or required during the contract term.

<DESC>DRY SUPPORT BRIDGE (DSB) MARKET SURVEY Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, current capabilities, and potential in performing the roles of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider in support of a DSB Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Program.  IAW AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deplo yment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.    Under this PBL contract, the contractor will be responsible for a large portion of the DSB logistics support, such as supply chain management and all scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance.  The Army will retain responsibility for the DSB s unscheduled field maintenance.  Operator and maintenance training (including both new equipment training and sustainment training) will be the contractors responsibility.  The support process is required to be transparent to the warfighter.  In addition , the contractor will be responsible for vehicle configuration, to include recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance and reliability. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 5 years.   Goal: Ultimate goal is ultra-availability (readiness).  Our goal is to structure a contract, which will incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the process.  Desired Results and Outcomes:  Operational readiness 90% or better.  Reduced logistics footprint, unscheduled maintenance, training burden, scheduled maintenance and maintenance times. Proposed Measurements:  Level of performance expressed in terms of measurable outcomes/how outcomes are to be measured and evaluated. Operational Readiness -  90 percent or better.  Launcher vehicle starts and complete bridging mission every time. Reduced Logistics Footprint  Measurable reduction in number of tools required  (special and common).  Measurable reduction in number of maintenance, repair   and troubleshooting tasks.  Measurable reduction of training required.   PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE 1. Name of Firm  Address City,State, Zip Code Point of Contact Name Telephone Number Email Address Website Address 2. What would be your business approach to meeting these responsibilities for managing the DSB fleet? 3. How would you propose meeting the goal of ultra-availability? 4. What potential constraints or boundaries do you see with one contractor having ultimate responsibility for managing the majority of logistics and configuration support under a PBL arrangement? 5. How do you see the government measuring these specific areas for obtaining supply support, reliability, training and maintenance?  What suggestions might you have? 6. What would you recommend as the approach to supply chain management in support of the DSB fleet? 7. How would you approach performance of sustainment maintenance and reduce vehicle maintenance, both scheduled and unscheduled? 8. How would you approach operator/maintainer training and reduce training needs?  9. Would you be willing to provide this type of support under a long-term contract?    10. What would you do differently in support of deployment contingency (wartime vs peacetime) operations? 11. How do you foresee the target price for a fixed level of PBL to be set up?  What would a fair payment plan/schedule consist of and how could it be linked to successful performance? Response to this market research survey questionnaire should be se nt via email to the Contract Specialist, Earl Rashid at rashide@tacom.army.mil.  You can respond in total or to any part of this questionnaire.

DEFINITIONS APPENDIX A Performance Based Logistics (PBL):  PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes)., and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the PMs designated  Product Support Integrator (PSI) and their support provider(s).  PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a pre-determined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to ne gotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. Sustainment Training: New Equipment Training: Two Level Maintenance: Sustainment Maintenance: Field Maintenance: Reliability: Recapitalization (recap):

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.   This is a Sources Sought synopsis for market research purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the United States Government (government) to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP), award a contract, or otherwise pay for information that  is provided in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis is for acquisition planning purposes only and does not restrict the government in determining the ultimate acquisition approach for the requirement, if any.  Accordingly, interested sources are urge d and expected to inspect the site where work will be performed.  The present assumption is that Fort Sam Houston located in San Antonio, Texas, would be the pilot or test site for the model being considered with additional installations and sites identifi ed for future application.  Therefore, an organized site visit of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, military dining facilities is scheduled for Wednesday, August 3, 2005, beginning at 9:00 a.m. (0900) CDT.  Participants will meet at the Southern Region Contracting Center-West offices located in building 4197, Fort Sam Houston, Texas.  Participation is limited to no more than two (2) representatives per interested source.  Sources shall submit the names of proposed participants no later than 3:00 p.m. (1500) CDT, Fri day, July 8, 2005, to Ms. Carolyn Staten at the following E-mail address: Carolyn.Staten@samhouston.army.mil. Ms. Staten will provide E-mail confirmation of such submission and shall provide information required to attain entry onto Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and directions to the Southern Region Contracting Center-West offices. Background for requirement.  The Installation Management Agency (IMA) Southwest Region Office (SWRO, henceforth IMA SWRO) is a field operating agency of the Department of the Army (Army).  The Army currently obtains dining facilities and food services using numerous contractual instruments that are administered both by individual installation and under combined installation contracts.  Contracts are presently local, regional, and national.  Contracts for food services to soldiers are currently separated  into those in which the military operates the dining facility but contractors provide dining facility attendants services and those in which the contractors provide full food services under the Randolph-Sheppard Act.  IMA SWRO now supports Army Garrison f ull food services operations on nine Army installations with 38 dining facilities that use 100% full food services contracts.  These installations are Fort Bliss, Fort Hood, Fort Huachuca, Fort Irwin, Fort Polk, Fort Sill, Fort Sam Houston, Presidio of Mon terey, and the West Coast Garrison (which is comprised of Fort Hunter Liggett, Camp Parks, and BT Collins).  These full food services are provided in a Government-Owned Contractor-Operated (GOCO) environment.  The government owns the facilities and contrac ts for the necessary services (full food services) to provide labor, supervision, supplies, management, and specified equipment not otherwise provided by the government to prepare, plan, and serve meals (including the cleaning and maintenance of these fa cilities). Objectives.  IMA SWRO is investigating the use of an operational food services model that employs a facility lease program for a Contractor-Owned Contractor-Operated (COCO) commercial catered meal concept to provide commercial-type feeding locations on IMA  SWRO installations that currently use full food services contracts.  This model is a significant change to the current Army feeding requirements program.  It shares only minimal similarities with either of the current Army methods/concepts (i.e., full foo d services or dining facility attendants services).  IMA SWROs concept consists of a robust feeding approach that uses the leased facilities/ sites on Army installations to deliver a system-wide commercial catered meal based upon standard internal anchor branding food offerings that are combined with the traditional meal offering.  The model for this approach is that which is offered currently i n all regional COCO food service operations found in College and University as well as business and industry dining operations (e.g., salad market, display cookery, pizza, dessert and other food bars, hot line and short order grills similar to those now si tuated in Army dining facilities).  The internal anchor branding will serve as the basic standard theme for regional commercial catered meal operations.  The anchor branding concept may be more robust in some facilities than in others (e.g., Flagship, trai ning or limited branding and Kiosk branding).  In an installation Flagship commercial catered meal model, a number of anchor brands are expected for those operations.  Internal anchor branding will offer a standard branding concept region-wide.  The brandi ng concept must provide a robust anchor brand to include graphics, point of sale materials, standard signage, and operational details.  The anchor brand concept must create a region-wide platform from which to communicate both to diners and staff an ov erall Army and contractor vision of the Armys mission to feed soldiers. Unlike the current allowance-based full food services contracts in which the government provides facilities, utilities, equipment, subsistence, labor services and management (either internally or through contracts), the proposed model will purchase meals  only for Subsistence-in-Kind (SIK) soldiers.  All resources and capital expenditures related to providing food services will be the contractors responsibility.  The IMA SWRO model intends to establish a contract pricing objective based on the price per plate of food approach.  This price per plate approach shall include all costs related to the delivery of meals to SIK soldiers.  Surge requirements and remote site (field) feeding of SIK diners must be included in any proposal.  Surge requirements and field feeding meals will be delivered complete and FOB destination location.  All other diners permitted to eat in these leased feeding facilities will reimburse the contractor directly for food consumed at a fair market price for such food. Sources Sought.  This Sources Sought is a Request for Information (RFI) to identify potential sources and obtain information from potential sources that are interested in providing these leased facilities anchor-branding food services to Army installatio ns within the IMA SWRO region.  All sources capable of providing these services are being sought.  Capability statements must provide or demonstrate, through past experience or otherwise: (1) an understanding/familiarity with commercial food service operat ions; (2) proven capability to perform and manage these services; (3) financial capability to perform the services required; (4) business size; (5) a recommended statement of work for these services; (6) a performance and delivery schedule; and (7) a perfo rmance period.  The government shall not pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI.  The government requests that interested sources submit an electronic response of not more than twenty-five (25) one-sided pages that may be printed onto 8. 5 X 11 inch paper, 12-pitch, Times New Roman font, with a minimum of one (1) inch margins all around.  Sources having the relevant experience and capability may submit their statement of interests and capabilities via E-mail to carolyn.staten@samhouston.ar my.mil no later than 3:00 p.m. (1500) CDT on Tuesday, September 2, 2005.  The subject line of such e-mail shall reference the Sources Sought leased facility  Anchor-Branding Food Services Announcement.  Responses received after this time and date shall not  be considered.

<SUBJECT>U--EMERGENCY OPERATIONS TRAINING AND SUPPORT
<SOLNBR>DE-RP52-05NA26901
<RESPDATE>070105
<CONTACT>Teresa Martinez, Contracting Officer, , ;Martin J Baca, Contract Specialist, ,
<DESC>EOTA and DHS Sources Sought Synopsis The Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration  (NNSA), Office of Nuclear Emergency Operations (NA-40) and the Department  of  Homeland Security (DHS), Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) are  contemplating an award(s) for emergency operations training and support.  This  announcement is for information and planning purposes only, to include  ascertaining the potential for small business participation.  This  procurement  is a follow-on action to both the current NNSA Emergency Operations  Training  Academy (EOTA) effort and the emergency response training provided to DHS  by  the NNSAâ€™s Nevada Test Site (NTS).  NA-40 is responsible for coordinating NNSAâ€™s emergency management and  response  capabilities with other federal government agencies including the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), DOE and NNSA Site Offices, and state  and  local emergency response organizations charged with managing and  responding to  natural disasters and nuclear, biological and chemical emergencies.  A  major  part of this responsibility is to assure that all NNSA personnel assigned  to  these duties possess the requisite training and professional competencies  necessary to perform the full range of duties required.  To fulfill these requirements, the NA-40 directs and funds NNSAâ€™s  Emergency  Operations Training Academy (EOTA).  The mission of the EOTA is to  implement  policy through a comprehensive training and professional development  program  geared to providing NNSA Headquarters, Service Center and Site Office  personnel  basic and enhanced professional skills, knowledge and abilities (KSAâ€™s)  consistent with high quality and effective nation-wide job performance.  EOTA  performs this mission by operating a centralized training center located  in  Albuquerque, New Mexico and coordinating and certifying related emergency  operations/management training developed and delivered at other NNSA Site  Offices located throughout the country.  The mission of the Emergency  Operations Training Academy also is to ensure the effective and efficient  training of emergency operations personnel throughout DOE who are or may  become  involved in the planning, preparedness, and response of vital national  resources. The Academy will provide oversight for all emergency operations  training at all DOE/NNSA facilities for NA-40.  Where appropriate, the  Academy  implements training programs to enhance the quality and depth of emergency  management and response throughout DOE/NNSA.  In light of the proposed  strategic intent and vision, this mission statement will eventually be  revised  to become broader in its application. The Emergency Operations Training  Academy  will be recognized as the model technical training provider for DOE  emergency  operations personnel, while expanding its customer base to include other  designated government and private-sector national and international  organizations that require professional training, education, and  vocational  services.  In this expanded role, the Academy will be a vital training and  service asset for DOE and the nation. Currently, the NTS supports DHS/ODP by providing weapons of mass  destruction  (WMD) responder training.  DHS has requested NNSA to include their  forecasted  training requirements on this potential acquisition.  EOTA has scoped their requirement by providing the estimated full-time  equivalents by task.  Contrastingly, ODP has scoped their requirement by  detailing the number of classes, by course, and the requirements of each  class.  Copies of the EOTA and ODP draft Statements of Work, upon which  the  forecasted work and this sources sought synopsis is based, can be found on  this  website under the identification number DE-RP52-05NA26901.  Contractor personnel assigned to this effort shall have a completed  National  Agency Check (NAC), or have submitted for a NAC in order to use Government  information systems and/or to access certain NNSA/ODP unclassified  information.  Access to classified information requires either a final or  interim clearance at the appropriate level.  Potential offerors shall submit statements of capabilities (SOCs) to this  office.

<DESC>DRY SUPPORT BRIDGE (DSB) MARKET SURVEY Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, current capabilities, and potential in performing the roles of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider in support of a DSB Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Program.  IAW AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deplo yment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.    Under this PBL contract, the contractor will be responsible for a large portion of the DSB logistics support, such as supply chain management and all scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance.  The Army will retain responsibility for the DSB s unscheduled field maintenance.  Operator and maintenance training (including both new equipment training and sustainment training) will be the contractors responsibility.  The support process is required to be transparent to the warfighter.  In addition , the contractor will be responsible for vehicle configuration, to include recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance and reliability. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 5 years.   Goal: Ultimate goal is ultra-availability (readiness).  Our goal is to structure a contract, which will incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the process.  Desired Results and Outcomes:  Operational readiness 90% or better.  Reduced logistics footprint, unscheduled maintenance, training burden, scheduled maintenance and maintenance times. Proposed Measurements:  Level of performance expressed in terms of measurable outcomes/how outcomes are to be measured and evaluated. Operational Readiness -  90 percent or better.  Launcher vehicle starts and complete bridging mission every time. Reduced Logistics Footprint  Measurable reduction in number of tools required  (special and common).  Measurable reduction in number of maintenance, repair   and troubleshooting tasks.  Measurable reduction of training required.   PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE 1. Name of Firm  Address City,State, Zip Code Point of Contact Name Telephone Number Email Address Website Address 2. What would be your business approach to meeting these responsibilities for managing the DSB fleet? 3. How would you propose meeting the goal of ultra-availability? 4. What potential constraints or boundaries do you see with one contractor having ultimate responsibility for managing the majority of logistics and configuration support under a PBL arrangement? 5. How do you see the government measuring these specific areas for obtaining supply support, reliability, training and maintenance?  What suggestions might you have? 6. What would you recommend as the approach to supply chain management in support of the DSB fleet? 7. How would you approach performance of sustainment maintenance and reduce vehicle maintenance, both scheduled and unscheduled? 8. How would you approach operator/maintainer training and reduce training needs?  9. Would you be willing to provide this type of support under a long-term contract?    10. What would you do differently in support of deployment contingency (wartime vs peacetime) operations? 11. How do you foresee the target price for a fixed level of PBL to be set up?  What would a fair payment plan/schedule consist of and how could it be linked to successful performance? Response to this market research survey questionnaire should be sent via emai l to the Contract Specialist, Earl Rashid at rashide@tacom.army.mil.  You can respond in total or to any part of this questionnaire. Any product literature that cannot be emailed may be sent to: TACOM, ATTN:  AMSTA-AQ-ATAB, Mail Stop 420, 6501 E. 11 Mile Rd., Warren, MI 48397-5000. Replies to this questionnaire must be received by 24 June 2005.  You may fax in your response to (586) 574-8636 if you do not have electronic capability.  You are allowed to mark any document or information submitted as confidential.  Please mark your info rmation Proprietary, as you feel appropriate.  Your input is voluntary and no compensation can be made for your participation in this survey. We appreciate your cooperation in answering these questions and thank you in advance for your participation.   DEFINITIONS APPENDIX A Performance Based Logistics (PBL):  PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes)., and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the PMs designated  Product Support Integrator (PSI) and their support provider(s).  PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a pre-determined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to ne gotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. Sustainment Training: New Equipment Training: Two Level Maintenance: Sustainment Maintenance: Field Maintenance: Reliability: Recapitalization (recap):

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.   This is a Sources Sought synopsis for market research purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the United States Government (government) to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP), award a contract, or otherwise pay for information that  is provided in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis is for acquisition planning purposes only and does not restrict the government in determining the ultimate acquisition approach for the requirement, if any.  Accordingly, interested sources are urge d and expected to inspect the site where work will be performed.  The present assumption is that Fort Sam Houston located in San Antonio, Texas, would be the pilot or test site for the model being considered with additional installations and sites identifi ed for future application.  Therefore, an organized site visit of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, military dining facilities is scheduled for Wednesday, August 3, 2005, beginning at 9:00 a.m. (0900) CDT.  Participants will meet at the Southern Region Contracting Center-West offices located in building 4197, Fort Sam Houston, Texas.  Participation is limited to no more than two (2) representatives per interested source.  Sources shall submit the names of proposed participants no later than 3:00 p.m. (1500) CDT, Fri day, July 8, 2005, to Ms. Carolyn Staten at the following e-mail address: Carolyn.Staten@samhouston.army.mil. Ms. Staten will provide e-mail confirmation of such submission and shall provide information required to attain entry onto Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and directions to the Southern Region Contracting Center-West offices. Background for requirement.  The Installation Management Agency (IMA) Southwest Region Office (SWRO, henceforth IMA SWRO) is a field operating agency of the Department of the Army (Army).  The Army currently obtains dining facilities and food services using numerous contractual instruments that are administered both by individual installation and under combined installation contracts.  Contracts are presently local, regional, and national.  Contracts for food services to soldiers are currently separated  into those in which the military operates the dining facility but contractors provide dining facility attendants services and those in which the contractors provide full food services under the Randolph-Sheppard Act.  IMA SWRO now supports Army Garrison f ull food services operations on nine Army installations with 38 dining facilities that use 100% full food services contracts.  These installations are Fort Bliss, Fort Hood, Fort Huachuca, Fort Irwin, Fort Polk, Fort Sill, Fort Sam Houston, Presidio of Mon terey, and the West Coast Garrison (which is comprised of Fort Hunter Liggett, Camp Parks, and BT Collins).  These full food services are provided in a Government-Owned Contractor-Operated (GOCO) environment.  The government owns the facilities and contrac ts for the necessary services (full food services) to provide labor, supervision, supplies, management, and specified equipment not otherwise provided by the government to prepare, plan, and serve meals (including the cleaning and maintenance of these fa cilities). Objectives.  IMA SWRO is investigating the use of an operational food services model that employs the Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) program for a Contractor-Owned Contractor-Operated (COCO) commercial catered meal concept to provide commercial-type feeding loca tions on IMA SWRO installations that currently use full food services contracts.  This model is a significant change to the current Army feeding requirements program.  It shares only minimal similarities with either of the current Army methods/concepts (i. e., full food services or dining facility attendants services).  IMA SWROs concept consists of a robust feeding approach that uses EUL facili ties/sites on Army installations to deliver a system-wide commercial catered meal based upon standard internal anchor branding food offerings that are combined with the traditional meal offering.  The model for this approach is that which is offered curren tly in all regional COCO food service operations found in College and University as well as business and industry dining operations (e.g., salad market, display cookery, pizza, dessert and other food bars, hot line and short order grills similar to those n ow situated in Army dining facilities).  The internal anchor branding will serve as the basic standard theme for regional commercial catered meal operations.  The anchor branding concept may be more robust in some facilities than in others (e.g., Flagship,  training or limited branding and Kiosk branding).  In an installation Flagship commercial catered meal model, a number of anchor brands are expected for those operations.  Internal anchor branding will offer a standard branding concept region-wide.  The b randing concept must provide a robust anchor brand to include graphics, point of sale materials, standard signage, and operational details.  The anchor brand concept must create a region-wide platform from which to communicate both to diners and staff an overall Army and contractor vision of the Armys mission to feed soldiers. Unlike the current allowance-based full food services contracts in which the government provides facilities, utilities, equipment, subsistence, labor services and management (either internally or through contracts), the proposed model will purchase meals  only for Subsistence-in-Kind (SIK) soldiers.  All resources and capital expenditures related to providing food services will be the contractors responsibility.  The IMA SWRO model intends to establish a contract pricing objective based on the price per plate of food approach.  This price per plate approach shall include all costs related to the delivery of meals to SIK soldiers.  Surge requirements and remote site (field) feeding of SIK diners must be included in any proposal.  Surge requirements and field feeding meals will be delivered complete and FOB destination location.  All other diners permitted to eat in these EUL feeding facilities will reimburse the contractor directly for food consumed at a fair market price for such food. Sources Sought.  This Sources Sought is a Request for Information (RFI) to identify potential sources and obtain information from potential sources that are interested in providing these EUL anchor-branding food services to Army installations within the IMA SWRO region.  All sources capable of providing these services are being sought.  Capability statements must provide or demonstrate, through past experience or otherwise: (1) an understanding/familiarity with commercial food service operations; (2) prov en capability to perform and manage these services; (3) financial capability to perform the services required; (4) business size; (5) a recommended statement of work for these services; (6) a performance and delivery schedule; and (7) a performance period.   The government shall not pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI.  The government requests that interested sources submit an electronic response of not more than twenty-five (25) one-sided pages that may be printed onto 8.5 X 11 inch pa per, 12-pitch, Times New Roman font, with a minimum of one (1) inch margins all around.  Sources having the relevant experience and capability may submit their statement of interests and capabilities via e-mail to carolyn.staten@samhouston.army.mil no late r than 3:00 p.m. (1500) CDT on Tuesday, September 2, 2005.  The subject line of such e-mail shall reference the Sources Sought EUL Anchor-Branding Food Services Announcement.  Responses received after this time and date shall not be considered.

We appreciate your cooperation in answering these questions and thank you in advance for your par ticipation.  Program Information follows next. Survey questionnaire may be found at the end.  PURPOSE: The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, current capabilities, and potential in performing the roles of Product Support Integrator (PSI)/Product Support Provider (PSP) in support of a Laundry Advanced System (LADS) Performance Based Logistic s (PBL) Program.  The Government is seeking information to develop a PBL concept for LADS.  The Government has not committed to PBL for LADS at this point.  IAW Army Regulation 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is DOD's preferred support strategy for materiel syste ms.  The Army will implement PBL, when appropriate, on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; redu ction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  The term 'PSI' refers to both government and civilian agencies with which we may establish a contract or an agreement.   Under a PBL contract, the contractor would be responsible for a large portion of the LADS logistics support, such as supply chain management and reduction in scheduled and unscheduled Crew, Organizational and Direct/General support level maintenance throug h improvements to the system.  The Army would retain responsibility for all maintenance of the LADS.  Sustainment training would be the contractor's responsibility.  The support process is required to be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the co ntractor would be responsible for LADS configuration management, to include recommendation of configuration changes to improve performance and reliability.   PBL DEFINITIONS:  Performance Based Logistics (PBL):  PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall  on the Product Manage r's designated Product Support Integrator (PSI) and their support provider(s).  PBL is:   -Buying results not resources -Using performance specs not design specs -Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a pre-determined course of action. -About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Product Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a private /public sector partnership). Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI would be required to n egotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.  Examples of PSPs include:  Defense Logistics Agency centers, Army Materiel Command Major Subordinate Command Inventory Materiel Management Centers  (IMMCs), Depots, contractors, sub-contractors, e tc. INTENT:  Length/Type of Contract:  Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 20 years. GOAL:  The ultimate goal is improved readiness and ultra-reliability.  Our goal is to structure a contract, which would incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the pr ocess. DESIREC RESULTS AND OUTCOMES:   1.  Operational readiness 98% or better for the system.  LADS is reported as a system and includes the 30kW Tactical Quiet Generator (TQG), M1088 5T Tractor and M871A3 Trailer. 2.  Reduced logistics footprint, unscheduled maintenance, training burden, scheduled maintenance and maintenance times. PROPOSED MEASUREMENTS:  Level of performance expressed in terms of measurable outcomes/how outcomes are to be measured and evaluated. Current Report Available:   1.  The current DA Form 2406, Unit Equipment and Serviceability Report (U) provide data on the following:  Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) and Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) for both the Organizational level maintenance and Support level maintena nce.  These are the only metrics recorded, maintained, reported and available to the Product Manager (PM) or PSI.  Data is reported in percentages of down time due to the lack of repair parts (Not Mission Capable Supply) or lack of time, or maintenance per sonnel to perform the maintenance (Not Mission Capable Maintenance).  The reverse side of the DA Form 2406 provides the data on specific equipment (by bumper number) that is down at the time of the report. 2.  DA Form 2406 data can provide an indication of systemic problem exists.  However, it does not provide specific parts or procedures that fail causing low readiness rates.  Commanders can provide comments/remarks in their monthly Unit Status Report (USR) . 3.  Reported data is not always accurate, although it can indicate a systemic problem within a fleet. It does not necessarily provide the root cause of that systemic failure. 4.  As mentioned, the monthly DA Form 2406 is the only metric available to the PM for review and assessment of how well our system is performing.  No other statistics are maintained or reported.  Any other data desired or required would have to be research ed by the contractor.  Units are not manned, nor do they have the expertise or equipment, to collect any other data.  Additional data, e.g. Mean Time Between Essential Function Failure, Mean Time Between System Abort, etc., would need to be collected by tr ained personnel outside the unit. Potential Performance Measures: The following performance measures could be established by the LADS for supply support and can be traced through the Commodity command Standard System (CCSS). 1.  The PSI would be responsible for maintaining a Non-Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) rate, e.g., less than 2% at the Organizational and Support (under the two-level maintenance concept; Field and Sustainment level of maintenance). 2.  The PSI would be responsible for the transportation/shipping of material to destination.  The PSI would ship all assets to the commercial shipping address specified by the activity.  The PSI would be responsible for meeting delivery time frames specifi ed below.  The PSI must be able to provide asset visibility to the requisitionor and would be responsible for providing input to the Global Transportation Network (GTN) for all shipments of material for which the PSI is assigned as the Inventory Control Po int (ICP).   Order Ship Time (OST) is the time from when a requisition is dropped to the time it is closed out by the recipient and is inclusive of transportation). Order Ship Time for Essentiality Code A items:  Priority 01-03, 2-3 days; Priority 04-08, 4-5 days; Priority 09-15, 6-8 days. Order Ship Time for Essentiality Code C items:  Priority 01-03, 3-4 days; Priority 04-08, 5-7 days; Priority 09-15, 8-10 days. 3.  Inventory Control.  The PSI wo uld be accountable for the storage, management and distribution of the wholesale inventory using the PSI's approved inventory management processes.  Warehouse Denials would be 0%.  The PSI would be responsible for the management and accountability of the r etail stock at Authorized Stockage List (ASL)/Prescribed Load List (PLL) level.  The required outcome is to have serviceable spares and repair parts available to support planned LADS operational requirements.  The PSO would report the status of the wholesa le inventory to the Government. 4.  Quality of Parts.  All articles delivered would be required to be free from defects in accordance with their operational application.  Any article failing to operate correctly would be returned to the PSI for repair or replacement.  If the PSI is a con tractor, a monthly report would be required.  If the PSI is government, Quality Deficiency Reports (QDRs) would be monitored. 5.  Failure Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action.  The PSI would, as part of an overall reliability program, define and describe the implementation of a failure and fault reporting, analysis and corrective action program.  The PSI would tabulate and t race all reported failures from discovery to action closeout.  All failure analysis would be closed out within 60 days of occurrence unless the Government grants an extension. 6.  Supply Support Requirements.  The PSI would procure, repair, overhaul, manage, and distribute spare parts and material, both repairable and consumable, to satisfy all LADS wholesale and retail supply support requirements.  The PSI would procure and dis tribute retail level requirements.  This refers specifically to ASL/PLL.  The PSI would make recommendations to unit commanders on lines to be stocked at the unit and Direct Support (DS) level.  The PSI would be responsible for determining wholesale requir ements to support demand forecasts.  The PSI would provide the necessary services to accommodate anticipated Government requirements (deployments).   7.  Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  The PSI would receive and process all requisitions and maintain an on-line requisition status tracking and reporting system capable of providing requisition and transportation status, requisition cancellations, and r equisition notifications  The system would have to be capable of providing status on all Government requisitions to authorized Government offices and individual requisition status to requisitioning units. 8.  Configuration Management.  The PSI would manage LADS weapons system configuration to ensure integrity and compatibility of the system, subsystem, assembly, and subassembly configuration baseline in an automated configuration database. 9. The PSI would administer and manage a repair program for Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) while retaining other metrics as outlined above.   10.  Reduced Logistics Footprint.  The Government would seek a measurable reduction in number of tools required (special and common); measurable reduction in number of maintenance, repair and troubleshooting tasks; measurable reduction of training required ; and a measurable increase in fuel economy. PBL System Candidates:  Systems to be supported under this PBL Program are systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and reset/recap systems.  (Profile of LADS provided below).  These profiles would include both wartime an peace time OPTEMPO (Operations Tempo) and specific details necessary to determine level of work required to perform the support operations. LADS PBL CANDIDATE PROFILE TEMPLATE: Vehicle System:  Laundry Advanced System. Model Designators:  Models A, B and C. System Description/Mission Profile. System Description:  The LADS is composed of laundry processing and a water recycling system (laundry), a 30kW TQG, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), all mounted on a 22-1/2 ton M871A3 trailer (GFE) measuring 40' x 8'.  The laundry attaches to the tra iler via International Standards Organization (ISO) locks on the center 20' of the trailer.  The LADS is towed by a 5T tractor in the field.  An electric water pump is used to supply water from field water storage.  The LADS provides laundry for up to 500 soldiers per day.  The LADS cleans a mixed load of Battle Dress Uniforms (BDUs), field jackets, underwear, socks, Army NOMEX flight uniforms and gloves, medical surgical gowns, drapes and linens, bed linens, and patient clothing.  The LADS is also capable of cleaning fabric Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE).  The LADS processes a load of laundry in about one hour using water and detergent.  Less than two gallons of water is used to launder each pound of clothing.  Approximately 97% of the water used by the laundry would be recycled.  This greatly reduces the amount of water required and minimizes the generator of wastewater.  The LADS reduces water consumption from 6,000 gallons per day per M85 (predecessor system) to 540 gallons per da y per LADS, vastly reducing the logistics burden of producing and delivering up to 24,000 gallons of water per day (4 M85s to 1 LADS).      Major and/or Secondary Items:  The LADS consists of two washer/dryer drums, a distillation-based waste recycling system, water storage tanks, operating/control system, and one ISO frame measuring 8'x8'x20'.  A travel cover converts to an awning that c overs the work platform to provide protection from rain, sun, and wind.      Basic Sustainment Materiel (BSM):  There are two requirements that must be supplied before the unit can be operated.  These are water, and fuel (JP8) for the LADS and the generator.  The LADS operates on either commercially provided power (208 volt, 5 0-60 Hertz, 3 phase) or Army tactical generator power 30 kilowatts (kW).        Predecessor System Information:  The LADS replaces the M85 Laundry (Line Item Number (LIN) L48315) on a one to four basis.  There are 6 LADS per Field Services Company. MISSION SCENARIO Deployed within the brigade, division, corps, and echelons above corps area, the LADS operation would typically be centralized and process clothing in the same manner that the Field Service Company, General Support (GS) (in support of divisional troops) an d Supply and Service Company, DS (non-divisional troops) currently operate.  Support to forward area (brigade and battalion trains), and decentralized operations may require the LADS to move once during a 72-hours period. The wartime scenario addresses three major missions.  The operational concept for the LADS during any wartime scenario is to provide laundry services supporting a particular area of activity.  All personnel in the theater of operation receive laundry servi ce as soon as the tactical situation permits and resources can be deployed.  The standard is to provide fifteen pounds of laundry for each Soldier per week during defensive operations.  Cited below is the representation of the total operating time (OT) per  mission, total operating and alert time (OT and AT), and total calendar time (CT) for the identified scenario types.   The peacetime mission supports dictated civil relief operations and military laundry training exercises, during which time operations would follow the applicable wartime Operational Mission Scenario (OMS)/Mission Profile (MP).   Mission is Brigade, OT is 2 0 hrs, OT and AT is 20 hrs, CT is 24, Movement is 1/3 days, No. of Missions is 1 and Total OT is 20. When Division, OT is 20 hrs, OT and AT is 20 hrs, CT is 720 hrs, Movement is 1/7 days, No. Missions is 30 and Total OT is 600 hrs.  When Corps, OT is 20 hr s, OT and AT is 20 hrs, CT is 1440 hrs, Movement is 1/7 days, and total OT is 1200 horus  The basic laundry mission described in the OMS consists of four reoccurring tasks as described herein. 1.  Task is Stand-by/Movement (including Set-Up) the No. of Occurrences is 1, the OT is 1.5 hrs and total time is 1.5 hrs.  2.   Task is System Start Up , the No. of Occurrences is 2, the OT is 30 min and total time is 1.0 hrs.  3.  Task is Cycle Time, No. of Occurrences is 2, the OT is 10.0 hrs, and Total OT is 20.0 hrs.  4.  Task is Movement Time (Including Tear-Down), No. of Occurrences is 1, OT is 1.5 hrs and Total OT is 1.5 hrs.  ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.  The Environmental conditions for wartime are listed in below.  These indicate that the majority of the fleet would be stationed in a basic environment and would make use of existing roadways (improved road) during movement the ma jority of the time.  However, current and projected deployments for Field Services Companies in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) place at least 25 percent of LADS in a Hot climate. For Hot Climatic Design Type, 15 percent of the Fleet.  For Basic Climati Design Type, 85 percent of the fleet.   MOVEMENT:   50 percent Improved Roads. 40 percent Unimproved Roads. 10 percent Cross-Country. Two LADS would deploy to a Brigade Support Area (BSA) for a 72-hour mission.  Two Soldiers would operate the LADS.  There would be two ten-hour shifts per day.  The LADS would provide laundry support for 500 Soldiers per day.  Soldiers would be allowed to turn in up to 15 pounds of laundry. PROJECTED ANNUAL USAGE: Peacetime:  10 hours per day; 28 days per year. Wartime:  15-20 hours per day; 330 day per year (while deployed). Original Equipment Manufacturer: Guild Associates Inc. 5750 Shier-Rings Road Dublin, OH  43017. Point of Contact Name: Mr. Henry Berns Telephone Number (614) 760-8016  email address:  berns@guildassociates.com.   FLEET ASSESSMENT:   Annual Support Workload (Maint AMMS) - Scheduled Services, etc. The LADS is supported by the standard Army logistics and maintenance systems.  The LADS is repairable within the current four-level Army maintenance system.  No additional Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) are required to support the LADS and no addi tional personnel are required as a result of fielding the LADS.  An overall system manual for the LADS has been published with the exception of the -24P.  This includes an electrical wiring diagram.  If repairs cannot be made at the DS level, maintenance p ersonnel would contact an SBC Logistics Assistance Representative (LAR) for assistance.  LARs can and do contact the Assistant Product Manager Field Services and Field Feeding of the PM Force Sustainment Systems office for further instructions. Unit Level (UL) Maintenance.  UL maintenance includes Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS), replacement of easily accessible unserviceable parts not requiring special tools or test materiel, lubrication, cleaning, preserving, tightening, rep lacement of parts and modules (authorized by the Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC), minor adjustments, and inspection of components. Direct Support (DS) Maintenance.  DS maintenance using common test equipment provides LRU services to unit maintenance. General Support (GS) Maintenance.  The current MAC does not identify any GS level tasks. Depot Maintenance.  Depot may perform overhaul if required.  However, given the low density of LADS, this function would most likely be contracted.  The current MAC only identifies four Depot level repairs. Reliability.  Details about the system readiness objective are as follows: The Mean Time Between Essential Function Failure (MTBEFF) is 270 hours minimum. The Mean Time Between System Abort (MTBSA) is 1200 hours. The Maintenance Ratio (MR) is 0.061 The Median Time to Repair (MedTTR) would be no greater than 1 hour for all Essential Unscheduled Maintenance Demands (EUMDs). The Maximum Time to Repair (MaxTTR) would be no greater than 3 hours for 90 percent of all essential EUMDs. Depot Capability - Current Workload.  The OEM is currently performing system overhauls and upgrades for systems returned from OIF/OEF.  There are no military depots involved in this effort, othe r than overhaul of the 30kW generator at Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD). Annual Sustainment Parts Cost:  $150-200K PBL Survey Questionnaire follows.  You can respond in total or to any part of this questionnaire. PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE.   1.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source firm fixed priced  purchase order to Rainin Instruments, Inc  Rainin Rd. Box 4026 Woburn, MA 18884. The purpose of this procurement is to identify a periodical to facilitate the nation-wide dissemination of information pertaining to preconception care to healthcare providers working in the area of maternal and child health. The intent is to provide up-to-date evidence-based knowledge to providers charged with caring for women and children with a repository of information on preconception care. As such the periodical and its membership must be consistent with the subject matter being published. 
For instance it would be inappropriate to disseminate the latest evidence on flying airplanes in a periodical whose focus was on automobiles and whose membership consisted of automobile mechanics. Because this subject matter falls within the arena of maternal and child health the Maternal and Child Health Journal (MCH) has been selected. The MCH Journal is a peer-reviewed journal which means it is of the highest scientific caliber and its extensive membership includes a host of disciplines and professionals actively working to promote the health of a woman prior to conception. After careful evaluation it has been determined that the MCH is the only periodical having the critical expertise as defined by: 1) subject area knowledge, 2) extensive membership access (i.e. -AMCHP, MOD, Women's Health), 3) peer-reviewed journal, and 4) provider impact. It is therefore requested that the professional services needed to fulfill the intent of this procurement be obtained via the Maternal and Child Health Journal.Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered by the contracting officer for competitive bids. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Mathew Ellington at 770.488.2677 or mce8@cdc.gov.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
Media Monitoring, Clipping and Analysis Services

I.	BACKGROUND
The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Office of Public Affairs (OPA) is responsible for the effective dissemination of accurate information to the public concerning FEMA’s programs, missions and goals for emergency management. The Office provides primary support to the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response, with lead responsibility for the communication of agency goals, objectives and accomplishments.  In addition, the Office is responsible for the preparation and distribution of critical response and recovery information to state and local officials, agency stakeholders, and the general public.

Because of the high profile nature of FEMA’s mission, emergency management-related stories remain prominently featured by media outlets.  The Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response, senior FEMA officials, and program managers need to be kept abreast of news coverage relating directly or indirectly to the mission and operations of FEMA as they relate to major disaster declarations, legislative activity and the operations of/about the agency.  They must remain current of issues that could impact FEMA in the future as well as those issues currently being reported. To meet this need, FEMA’s Office of Public Affairs is seeking a contractor to provide full-service clipping and media monitoring support.

II.	SUMMARY OF SUPPORT REQUIRED
FEMA’s Office of Public Affairs is responsible for ensuring agency management has access to timely and relevant information presented in an orderly format required for expeditious review, analysis and response by senior FEMA officials.  The Office of Public Affairs requires a professional company able to compile, evaluate, and analyze stories related to the agency and reported by different media outlets, including those currently obtained from our regional offices, disaster sites, clipping services, and from daily monitoring of major print, broadcast and web media in support of this requirement.

III.	TASKS
1.	Acquire, Edit and Organize Relevant News in a User Friendly Format
The Contractor must be able to provide an immediate overview, synopsis and analysis of the unique factual components of major news stories covered by print, broadcast and web media sources that directly or indirectly affect the program, policies and operation of the FEMA in order to inform the agency’s senior leadership.  

The Contractor shall produce a news summary with full articles and transcripts a minimum of five days a week (Monday through Friday), and in certain periods, seven days a week depending on the extent of current disaster activities, of news relating directly or indirectly to the mission and operation of FEMA and any current disasters as well as the impacts these have on state and communities.  

The clips package must contain a summary of the daily news and must also be organized by subject and immediate importance, as defined by the level of importance and impact to FEMA and the status of the news as reported by major media throughout the country.  The Office of Public Affairs shall provide a technical representative to direct the Contractor in the organization of topics.

Topics currently identified for scanning include, but are not limited to, the following: hurricanes; floods; earthquakes; mudslides; severe winter weather; tornadoes and similar severe weather events; chemical, biological, or radiological acts of terrorism; chemical, biological, or radiological catastrophes; wildfires; and severe droughts, and those disaster related economic or social impacts. The Contractor will also monitor political affairs for possible impact on FEMA.  

The Contractor shall work within, and if required, refine the existing process of collecting relevant news stories and anticipated media coverage information from the ten regional offices and from applicable Disaster Field Offices. Daily summaries must address print, radio, broadcast and online media outlets at the national, regional and local levels, as applicable.

2.	Distribute News Summary
The contractor shall produce a daily news summary in a format that includes a summary; table of contents; and all related articles as a final printable document for distribution to FEMA personnel. Internal distribution will include email to designated employees as well as posting to a password protected/secure location on FEMA’s Internet and Intranet sites. The agency maintain the rights to make unlimited copies and unlimited distribution of the final product electronically or in hardcopy for internal agency use, and to those officials working closely on FEMA’s disaster related issues

The news summary must be available for distribution and online posting between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., Monday through Friday, and by 8:00 a.m. on weekends (or as defined by the designated FEMA official).  The product should be delivered daily via e-mail to the designated FEMA official to be distributed to FEMA personnel. 
 

During times of greater coverage of agency activities (e.g. during disaster response operations), the contractor may be required to produce an additional afternoon version of the summary and clips to be distributed by early to mid-afternoon (by 3:00 or 4:00 p.m.).  

3.	Archiving and Analyzing the News
The Contractor shall organize and implement a digital archive catalog, system for the easy retrieval by internal sources of the archived material in a timely manner.  In addition, the contractor shall provide weekly summaries to the Office of Public Affairs providing an analysis and breakdown of the nature of the types of coverage the agency is receiving in the press.  In doing so, the contractor shall provide weekly updates outlining the news about the agency and breaking it down by disaster coverage, and in particular, by favorable, unfavorable and neutral press coverage.

4.	Sample
As part of the RFP response or prior to the approval of the contract award, the contractor must submit an example via e-mail or by submission on electronic media (compact disk or comparable) of the product they intend to deliver which provide for such things as a cover page with a table of contents that organizes the news clippings by topic and matter of importance.  This product should be consistent with current products being utilized.  FEMA reserves the right to request the contractor submit a revised example based on feedback provided in the negotiation process in order to ensure the daily product will meet the requirements of the agency.

5.	Format/Style Requirements
The news summary and clips need to include sections on national news, local news, stories not directly related to FEMA but impact the agency, weather/hazard related topics, a daybook schedule of Washington events and a section outlining the front pages of regional papers across the country.

6.	Reporting
The contractor shall also provide monthly reports and invoicing to the project officer detailing use and costs broken down by billing codes.

IV.	DELIVERABLES
During regular business operations, Monday through Friday, the consolidated clips would need to be sent to the Office of Public Affairs designated contact for distribution to the Under Secretary and senior staff no later than 7:00 a.m. daily. During response operations, weekend distribution is also required, requiring consolidated clips be distributed to the appointed public affairs staff person no later than 8:00 a.m.  

While the Under Secretary is on travel, it may be necessary to provide clips at an earlier hour (times may vary with regard to where and when the Under Secretary travels, but may be as early as 5:00 a.m.). During major disaster declarations, it may be required to provide additional versions throughout the day to monitor the developing issues occurring during the disaster. 

V.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE
All work under this contract shall be coordinated with public affairs staff in Washington DC and through the FEMA Headquarters Office located at 500 C Street, SW, Washington, DC 20472.

Sealed offers for the items to be provided shall be hand-carried or express mailed via UPS or Federal Express to the following location by 2:00PM (EST) 02 May 2005: COMMANDER, Attn: Mrs. Gabrielle Trickett, CTQ, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street, VA, 22314-5010.  NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  Evaluation Factors:  
Operational Effectiveness – Describe your ability to currently meet the performance requirements stated in the Performance Specification for the RPS.  Key features to address include Technical Compliance with Specification, Ruggedization, Size and Weight, and Additional (Value) Features.   Supportability - Key Supportability issues to address include Durability, Technical Data, and Warranty. Address any specific commercial or extended warranty provisions for the product.  Past Performance - Provide specific examples of favorable recent past performance that illustrates evidence of your ability to produce, deliver, and warrant your product.  Ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number and a description of the items procured.  Relative Order of Importance:   (i) Operational Effectiveness - Most important. (ii) Supportability – Next in importance.  (iii) Past Performance - Less important. Price - Evaluated, but not rated.  Award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the Government.  In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall technical, supportability, and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals.  Failure to meet each and every requirement will not automatically disqualify an offeror from consideration for contract award.  The government will utilize the PS to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of each offeror's technical solution.  Value Added features, as listed by the Government or proposed by the offeror will be factored in.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS: Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form. Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided. Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.

***Statement of Work for Modification and Repair to (2) paint booths***

Scope
The primary objective of this Statement of Work is to provide an outline of the modifications to be performed and repairs needed to return the two paint booths to a fully functional condition.

·	Travis AFB, Bldg 803
o	Paint Spray Booth, 2 each 


Basic Services
The vendor will be required to perform all modifications, repairs, or service to the two locally manufactured paint booths’ current exhaust ventilation systems, which are not performing to the requirements of the shape and size of the booths. The current design of the paint booths and filter systems do not allow for the proper volume of air flow and filtration required to protect the carbon filter bank from dust contaminates. In addition, the make-up air is overpowering the exhaust air and pushing the entry doors open. 

Booth description  
The current design of the two paint booths are shown in the attached pictures along with this description. The booths have two man doors each on either side, for a total of four personnel entry points. Each end of the paint booth has a double bi-fold door that goes from floor to top of the booth.  Each booth has an overhead carbon filter bank containing a total of  40, 20” X 20” filters each. The current particle filtration system is single stage with a carbon filter bank at the end of the line and a total of 28- 20” x 20” exhaust filters each at the front of the system (14 on each side) per booth with the ducting on the outside of the booth running up the side walls to the carbon bank. The banks are exhausted by a 20 horse 3 phase 2 speed 20” exhaust fan on each of the two carbon filter banks. Each booth has airline regulators and connections at all four corners. Each booth is equipped with an overpressure / heater fan system placed on top of its respective booth. Along the side walls are 4’ florescent lights (see pictures for details).  The booths are constructed of galvanized steel.  Booth #1 is 15 feet wide, 36 feet long and 24 feet high; booth #2 is 15 feet wide, 46 feet long and 24 feet high. Both are attached to a concrete floor. 
 
Required modifications/ repairs
·	The four man doors need a new latch similar to a walk-in freezer style, as shown in one of the attached pictures. Heavy duty

·	The overhead carbon filter banks containing a total of 40 each 20” X 20” will need to be emptied and new carbon placed in these filter boxes.   

·	The booths will require a complete modification of the total number of filters and the ducting system as follows: 

·	56 additional filters to equal a total of 84 per booth need to be installed.  All additions to the booths will be made to the outside of the booth as space is limited on the inside walls.
 
·	Each re-designed filter bank must be of a triple filter design… i.e. 
a)	STAGE ONE	a pre filter cloth (rolled over stage two and three)
b)	STAGE TWO	a standard fiber 20 X 20 filter 
c)	STAGE THREE	a triple pocket filter

Both exhaust motors will be replaced with a new 20 inch 50 horse power motor three phase two speed, vendor provided.  Second speed will be slower to allow for heated air flow to be reduced, improving dry time of parts painted. (Old fans and motors are to be used, if applicable, as trade-in-value towards the overall purchase).

·	Additional ducting to be routed for the increase of air flow volume through the exhaust filters. All old ducting to be vacuumed out and waste disposed of using government supplied containers (see “The Government will provide” for further details).

·	All lighting needing to be moved due to ducting/ filter placement will be relocated.  Relocation is required to prevent loss of existing total candle power.   

·	Vendor will perform a function test for all equipment upon completion of project. 

·	If any work requires deactivating or moving of any fire suppression nozzle/bottle from its current location, vendor will insure all fire suppression systems are in working order. The system is a pressurized dry chemical system. Original vendor for fire suppression was Code Three, located on railroad Ave. Suisun city Ca. 94585   

·	All air lines moved or disconnected will be placed in an appropriate area as required by booth position and filter modification and returned to a working order. 

Travel
 The contractor shall arrange and execute all travel necessary for the performance of the requirements in this SOW. 

The Government will provide:
·	The government will provide containers and disposal for all current hazardous materials created by both paint booths prior the start of any repairs or modifications.  This is to include, but not limited to, the paint dust from inside the ducting, all carbon in the carbon filter boxes, current used filters, paper within the booths. 
·	In addition, power outlets at 115 volts, lighting and stands and/or platforms (not to include any scaffolding).  A single point of contact will be provided to vendor for all modifications to be performed.

<DESC>Question #1 – Is the subject solicitation considered a development effort, or does the USMC anticipate this product to be an already designed and qualified UPS.

Question #2 - If it's development, what would the development cycle be?

Answer #2 – Due to being a commercial item, there should be no development cycle.

Answer #4 - Form, fit and function are left up to manufacturer.

Answer #6 – Based on question and answer above, this is not applicable.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to industry questions as follows:

Question 1.  Will you be accepting offers from contractors providing everything or can we participate in selected items.  In other words, we are interested in supplying the cable assemblies and connectors for this project. Are we able to submit our proposal for only those items only?

Answer 1.  There is only one item being solicited for and procured - the power supply with attached cables.  We do do not intend to procure items separately.  A separate proposal, if received, would be evaluated as non-compliant.

Question 2.  Please let us know how we may acquire the drawings for these items. 

Answer 2.  There are no drawings available.  All necessary data is included in the synopsis.

Proposals remain due 2:00 p.m. (EST) May 02, 2005.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR BENEFIT OPTIONS TRAINING.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions: 1.  Mod 3 indicates training should be geared toward employees "who will not be eligible for retirement" as of Sept. 2006."  By this do you mean "not eligible for voluntary optional retirement" only?  I am assuming that there will be a number of employees who will qualify for discontinued service retirement.  Are they part of the target audience for this training or will it be limited to only those employees who do not qualify for an immediate annuity under any provision at the time of separation? The answer to all of the questions above is:  It is limited to only those employees who do not qualify for an immediate annuity. 2.  Are you simply looking for a description of the contents of the materials or are you asking for a complete package of materials to review at this time? The Statement of Work VII.  Response to Market Research Request:  Answers this question.  Also in the Request for Quotation under EVALUATION it is specifically stated that: Selection and award will be made to that offeror whose offer will be the most adventageous to the Government (See FAR 2.101, Best Value), with consideration given to the factors of technical merit, price, and past performance.  Offers must provide (1)adequate past performance information of at least three previous contracts held with Government Agencies or Private Industry, and (2) products literature or other information to allow the Government to determine technical merit. 3.  You indicated that you would provide an "overhead projector."  Does that mean an LCD projector which could be utlized with a laptop to provide a PowerPoint presentation? Either one can or both can be provided.   The due date for receipt of offers is June 15, 2005. THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD CLOSES TODAY, IN ORDER TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATION.  NO MORE QUESTIONS SHALL BE ACCEPTED FOR THIS PROCUREMENT AFTER TODAY. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
