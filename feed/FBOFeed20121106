<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to the New York Sleep Institute, NYU Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, 223 East 34th Street, New York, NY 10016, for the analyses of modified polysomnograms obtained from NIMH's cohort of children with autism. The New York Sleep Institute will (1) examine polysomnography for sleep stages I-IV (N1-N3), REM percentage as a fraction of total sleep time, and latencies to particular stages, sleep efficiency and other parameters of the sleep/wake cycle, (2) use standard GRASS telefactor software to calculate sleep staging and (3) read studies in parallel with Program to achieve rater reliability.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the work is to be conducted at the New York Sleep Institute, which is well equipped to provide the tools to allow the experts to properly analyze such data.  The New York Sleep Institute has an expert, Dr. Alcibiades Rodriguez, which is fellowship trained in neurology, epilepsy and sleep and is a practicing clinician in sleep disorders. Correct analyses of sleep data on children with autism and possibly epileptic abnormalities can be quite challenging and is best done by neurologists who have formal sleep and epilepsy training and extensive experience in reading such studies. Dr. Rodriguez works closely with NYU's epilepsy center and he is familiar with the neurophysiology of persons with autism and developmental disabilities. He has consistently provided NIMH with high quality analyses of their pediatric polysomnograms over the last several years. Dr. Rodriguez is currently in the process of reading the follow-up polysmnographic examinations from NIMH's ongoing, longitudinal study of sleep in three cohorts of young children. These re-reads must be done by the same reader to ensure that there is continuity in testing and consistency in coding across the entire study sample. In addition, analysis of these samples must be done by the appropriate laboratory.  Analyses performed via this contract will allow researchers in the Pediatrics &amp; Developmental Neurosciences Branch to accomplish the goals of several clinical research protocols in various stages of development.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 12 months with option(s) for up to four additional one-year periods.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the acquisition of commercial items prescribed in FAR Part 12, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the competition requirements of Part 6. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 11:00 AM E.T., November 9, 2012 to John Flannery, flanneryje@mail.nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warefare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) Contracts anticipates awarding multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) on a sole source basis in support of the Integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) Program/Project, which is a tri-service (Army, Navy and Air Force) effort, for development and integration of the enhanced Telemetry Network System (TmNS) required for providing real-time test information between in-flight aircraft and ground engineering personnel.
<p>This synopsis is for awarding one of the aforementioned BOAs to Teletronics Technology Corporation (TTC) on a sole source basis to procure advanced TmNS components design and development. The requirement also entails procuring limited production quantities of the advanced design, testing and integration, and required support services. The overall goal is to further define iNET standards that are currently in draft stage. The BOA will be in effect for five (5) years and it will include provisions to issue delivery orders with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) CLINs. First two (2) years of each BOA will entail conducting advanced component design, development and testing (CPFF). The remaining three (3) years will entail procuring production quantities (FFP) and the maintenance and integration support services (CPFF).</p>
<p>TTC has been involved in iNET project since 2005 to either test new ideas or to refine previously adopted portions of the draft I-NETstandards. The effort will require TTC to continue with their on-going efforts to modify/advance their current designs in place for the components. The advanced prototypes to be implemented within fully operational devices in the actual environment that they are ultimately to be used. Once built, the advanced prototypes must be verified for their complete compliance with the draft iNET standards, which also requires validating that the standards are sufficiently detailed to achieve the desired interoperability. TTC is the only firm with the knowledge, expertise, and proprietary technical data required to perform this design and development effort to further advance their existing configuration of the components needed. The Government does not possess the required technical data to compete this procurement.</p>
<p>The effective period is anticipated to start in early fiscal year 2014.</p>
<p>The primary POC for this acquisition is Ms. Marisa Scruggs at (301) 757-9786 and/or marisa.scruggs@navy.mil.</p>

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to acquire continued research and development efforts directed toward the fabrication of carbon-carbon shape stable nosetip (SSNT) materials, development and fabrication of advanced reentry materials including antenna windows, control surfaces, leading edges, and heatshields; and supporting engineering studies.
  The procurement is required to support Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) reentry systems.  The effort will be fulfilled through other than full and open competition with Intermat, 389 Hill Street, Biddeford, Maine 04005-4335.   Intermat, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiber Materials Inc. (FMI), is uniquely qualified to conduct the efforts required by this effort and is the sole supplier of carbon-carbon composite, shape stable nosetips (SSNT) for the Navy MK5 reentry body.  The unique SSNT technology has proven to be the most effective solution devised for ensuring reliable, repeatable, and accurate reentry body flight performance in extremely harsh reentry environments.   It is of the utmost importance to maintain consistency when fabricating these materials.
  The billet weaving and densification procedures for these materials have a profound effect on their thermal and mechanical properties and their ablative and aerodynamic flight performance, use of the identical SSNT weaving and processing cycles is absolutely necessary.  Intermats carbon-carbon weaving and processing cycles are proprietary.  Only Intermat can reproduce these billet weaving and processing cycles, and thus is the only supplier who can fabricate the additional materials.   In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency by 20 November 2012.  A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee type contract is anticipated with a one-year base period and two one-year options.

<CONTACT>Shannon Mohler, Phone 7038526211, Email Shannon.Mohler@cbre.com - Herbert H. Hafter, JR, Broker, Phone 858-546-2647, Email herb.hafter@cbre.com
<DESC>The United States Government seeks to lease office and related support space consisting of approximately 10,900 rentable square feet of office and warehouse space and 1.6 acres of wareyard space in Las Vegas, Nevada. The space should yield a minimum of 10,900 ANSI/BOMA square feet (minimum 900 ABOA office and 10,000 warehouse). The office, warehouse and wareyard space shall be contiguous (the office must be inside the office/warehouse building and the wareyard must be immediately contiguous to the office/warehouse building). <br /><br />The warehouse space offered must have a minimum ceiling clear height of 16'. The space offered must be modifiable to install windows in the exterior walls to provide natural light for the office area and to install roll up doors with a minimum dimension of 14'H x 12"W. The wareyard area must be securable via a fence and adequate lighting. An up-to-date Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment will be required. <br /><br />The proposed space must be located within the following delineated area and must have the following characteristics: <br /><strong><br />North</strong>: Sahara Avenue;<br /><strong>South</strong>: South Hollywood Boulevard, Pabco Road, Warm Springs Road;<br /><strong>East</strong>: Blue Diamond (Rainbow to I15), St Rose Parkway (I15 to 215), 215/564 (564 to Warm Springs Road);<br /><strong>West</strong>: South Rainbow Boulevard.<br /><br />The space should be located in areas similar in nature to an industrial area which is open and has a low population density. Because the agency uses very large vehicles to perform their mission, the space cannot be located in high traffic areas to ensure agency vehicles have adequate turning radius' (are able to exit onto streets and roads in a timely manner without waiting long periods for other vehicles to clear) and are not creating traffic disturbances (blocking traffic). Spaces which are located in areas with easy access to large thoroughfares are preferred.<br /><br />Fully serviced leases are sought. All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration. The offered space must meet the Governments requirements for Fire, Life-safety, and Handicapped Accessibility. <br /><br />Property located within a base floodplain (100 year floodplain) or wetland will not be considered. <br /><br />The term of the proposed lease is ten (10) years, five (5) years firm. Occupancy is required on or before July 31, 2012. <br /><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:<br />Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and should include the following information at minimum (This is not an invitation for bids or a request for proposals):
<p>&bull; Building name/address<br />&bull; Legal property description, recent survey, and property identification numbers (PIN).<br />&bull; Location of space in the building and date it will be available.<br />&bull; One-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered and Site Plan..<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA defined office area/useable square feet (USF).<br />&bull; Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered and rental rate per square foot, specifying services, utilities, and tenant improvement allowance included.<br />&bull; Common Area Factor used to determine the RSF.<br />&bull; Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact.<br />&bull; In cases where an agent is representing multiple ownership entities, written acknowledgement, and permission to represent multiple owners for the same submission</p>
<p>AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:<br />GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative CBRE, Inc.<br /><br />Interested parties should submit pertinent information to the tenant broker and the GSA Contracting Officer:</p>

<p>The entire warehouse and office space shall be climate controlled (HVAC).</p>
<p>General Office ceiling height shall be at least 8 feet 6 inches and Warehouse ceiling height shall be at least 20 feet.</p>
<p>A minimum of four (4) loading docks with levelers, which must be capable of servicing full-length tractor plus 55 foot trailer.

<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>The Roseburg VA Healthcare System anticipates to contract for Level 3 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Services, with access to Specialists, for eligible Veteran patients requiring inpatient treatment in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) when referred, authorized, and/or transferred by the VARHCS.  It is expected that ICU services will be sourced from within 75 miles of the Roseburg VA Healthcare System.

The contractor shall provide inpatient intensive care unit (ICU) health care services to authorized patients for the full episodes of ICU care.  The contractor will be paid/reimbursed for inpatient services under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved DRGs based prospective payment system that encompass ICD-9-CM classifications (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modifications).  Medicare payments for inpatient health care services will be under the prospective payment system (PPS).  The DRG rate includes the cost of all non-physician hospital inpatient services, i.e. bed and board, nursing services, use of hospital facilities as referenced in 42 CFR 409.10 and CT scans, hemodialysis, prosthetic items, pacemakers, laboratory and X-ray services, etc., including those which the hospital must purchase from another facility.  Associated ancillary claims will be processed and paid based on current CFR payment methodology.  No separate billing or payment should be made for these services.  Inclusion or exclusion of services will be determined by Medicare PPS rules and regulations as published by CMS.

Contractor is expected to meet or exceed a level of ICU nurse staffing such that a minimum of one ICU competent nurse per three Veteran patients is met at all times.  Staffing ratio and competencies will be subject to review by VARHCS Nurse Executive or delegate.  

Requirement of ancillary services (Respiratory Therapy; Laboratory; Imaging services):  Ventilated patients are expected to have competent, certified Respiratory Therapy services consistent with the community standard of care.  All Respiratory Therapy services are subject to standard quality assurance activities as within the VA.  Laboratory, Diagnostic and Imaging services are required to be readily available for critical decision making for the contract staff, open to review by VA staff and meeting or exceeding standards for timeliness and accuracy.  All Laboratory, Diagnostic and Imaging services are subject to standard quality assurance activities as within the VA. 

Offers from prospective contractors must accept CMS reimbursement as the base form of payment. Therefore, all offers must be presented in the form of a percentage discount of the CMS rate.  The admissions identified in the CLINs below are estimated workload projections.

Veteran patients who receive care at the VARHCS sometimes have clinically complex conditions that exceed the ability of the VARHCS to deliver care commensurate with the needs of the patient.  At the present time, the VARHCS does not have an ICU, but has an average of one patient per day in ICU level treatment. VARHCS requires that Department of Veterans Affairs physicians coordinate transfers of eligible Veterans into and out of the contracted facility.

<p>FA2486-13-R-0042, CIGTF Advanced Threat Simulator, GPS Interference and Navigation Tool Software Modification</p>
<p>The 746th Test Squadron (746 TS), Holloman AFB, NM, is seeking sources for a Fixed-Price Contract in support of the CIGTF Advanced Threat Simulator (CATS) Program. The 746 TS Advanced Engineering Element is seeking to add features and functionality to the latest version of the GPS Interference and Navigation Tool (GIANT), Version 4.6. The software improvement focuses on implementing a user-definable Antenna Electronics Model for CATS, providing for file input describing GPS jammer interference signals and outputting files for use by Spirent simulators and software-driven waveform generators to create the NAVWAR environment to the GPS receiver.<br />GIANT was developed by LinQuest Corporation; 5140 W Goldleaf Cir Ste 400; Los Angeles, CA 90056-1299 in support of the Space &amp; Missile Systems Center Development Planning Directorate, Systems Analysis Branch. It is US Government-owned software used to model and simulate many-versus-many navigation system performance and mission impacts in a benign or electronic warfare environment.<br />The 746 TS implements the Adaptive Nulling Affects for Scenarios (ANEFS) Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) and Beam Pointing (BP) applications used by GIANT to model a multi-element antenna array and advanced antenna electronic (AE) system using the STAP weight update algorithm. <br />The 746 TS seeks to modify the current GIANT model and interfaces (ANEFS CRPA model) to achieve the following goals:<br />&bull; Accept an external data file representing a time-limited multiple cycle pristine interference signal (ex. Broadband noise, CW, Pulse, MBOC(6,1), BPSK(10), etc.). The external signal for each simulated transmitter shall be incorporated in the "Signal Type" GUI window of GIANT with proper transformation from the time domain to the frequency domain for accurate signal processing. Proper signal propagation in time within GIANT shall be accurately engineered for outputs.<br />&bull; Modify GIANT to generate two types of data output files. These files will be uploaded to two different types of signal generators. The combined result of the two files will model the signal output of the simulated AE model that will be comprised of both GPS and Jamming type signals. Signal outputs will account for the effects of terrain, incidence angle of wave-front on antenna array, platform dynamics (both UUT and jammer platform) and the particular GPS constellation. <br />o Output file formats shall be in the appropriate syntax as follows:<br />&#61607; Spirent Simulator MOD format<br />&#61607; Jamming signals need to be at a specified Intermediate Frequency (IF) sampling frequency and within a minimum and maximum amplitude range.<br />&bull; Improve the ANEFS CRPA model inputs to accept other weight updating algorithms (Ex. SFAP, RLS, etc.).</p>
<p>All improved features and functionality shall be seamlessly integrated within GIANT and work with all current GIANT functions and models. All modifications to the GIANT software shall be done at the source code level and completely integrate with the other GIANT features and capabilities relevant to the GPS antenna electronics models..</p>
<p>The contractor shall have the capability to provide the software modifications required to meet all goals of this effort. All deliverables shall be government owned and the provided source code shall be integrated into current and future versions of the GIANT toolset presently maintained by Lindquest for the Space &amp; Missile Systems Center. All interested sources are encouraged to respond to this synopsis and to identify their qualifications and experience through a Statement of Capability in the area of software modification and access to GIANT source code as described above no later than 21 Nov 2012. Please limit your Statement of Capability to no more than 10 pages. If emailing your Statement of Capability, please send it in a PDF or MS Word format. Include the following reference number on all correspondence: FA2486-13-R-0042.</p>
<p>Place of Performance and acceptance will be the contractor's facility and Holloman AFB, NM.<br />Please also identify business size as defined by NAICS Code 541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services ($25.5 Million, Small Business Size Standard). Information should be submitted either electronically or by mail to 96th Test Group, AFTC/PZZC, Attn: Jonathan Heitkam, 872 DeZonia Road, Holloman AFB NM 88330, jonathan.heitkam@holloman.af.mil. <br />Questions regarding this sources sought synopsis shall be directed to Jonathan Heitkam, 575-572-1245, email: jonathan.heitkam@holloman.af.mil. The Government shall not reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Product Manager- Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE) seeks an improvement over the current Army tactical drop-leg configuration holster system for the Army M9 specification Beretta 92F / 92FS pistol. The improvements sought are increased configuration modularity in addition to a drop-leg configuration, with a holster system capable of being quickly transferred and also worn on the hip, on Modular Lightweight Load Carrying Equipment (MOLLE) load carriage equipment such as rucksacks and the Tactical Assault Panel (TAP), worn under the arm with a shoulder harness, and on individual body armor such as the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) or the Soldier Plate Carrier System (SPCS). The MTH must be compatible with the Army's combat belt commonly called the "Rigger's" belt. This RFI will be used to determine if alternate solutions are currently available and the impact such a holster might have on future procurement efforts without creating an additional logistical requirement. The RFI requests capability statements from companies for the purpose of identifying potential sources that have designs they believe will assist the Army in identifying and evaluating a tactical holster in a drop-leg configuration and with the modularity as described above. This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This RFI is being issued in preparation for an anticipated Request for Proposal (RFP) for an improved modular tactical holster system in a drop-leg configuration and with the modularity as described above. Due to the time constraints, respondents must have a mature design in order to be considered as a potential source for this effort.
<p>The required characteristics of this Modular Tactical Holster system:</p>
<p>1. Required Characteristics</p>
<p>a. The MTH system can be configured by the Operator to be worn on thigh and allow the pistol grip to be at or near arms length and without interfering with other tactical equipment.</p>
<p>b. The MTH system can be quickly interchangeable/reconfigurable among multiple carrying positions that include the thigh, hip, under the arm shoulder harness, individual body armor (IBA), and on individual load carrying equipment. These interchanges must be accomplished by the Operator without special tools. The attachment/interfacing hardware items must be system components and available in sufficient quantity so that the attachment/interfacing hardware may be pre-positioned (Operator preference) and does not have to be moved from one carrying/configuration location to another when detaching and reattaching the holster.

Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty, windy, and polluted environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty or polluted environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>Period of Performance <br />The period of performance for this order will be one year from the date of award with the option to renew for up to 4 years.</p>
<p>D. POSITION ELEMENTS</p>
<p>The Justice Sector Advisor will be under the leadership and direction of the U.S. Embassy-Kabul INL Section's (INL/Kabul) Director and Deputy Director, reporting through the INL/Kabul Justice Team Lead.

<p>Travel and Position Location: The position is located within Regional Commands throughout Afghanistan. Frequent travel in and around the assigned province is likely. All movements within Afghanistan will be covered by the U.S. military and/or INL air wing and motor pool assets, and all travel outside of Afghanistan will be covered by commercial airlines.</p>

The field campaign will be based on the Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) concept as described in the ABoVE Scoping Study Report, Revised ABoVE Executive Summary, and report of the June 13-15, 2012 ABoVE Workshop (available at http://cce.nasa.gov/terrestrial_ecology/above/index.html    ; if this Web site is not available, please send an email to support@cce.nasa.gov to request copies of the desired documents). Climate change in the Arctic and boreal region is unfolding faster than anywhere else on Earth, resulting in a longer ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer, warming and thawing of permafrost, increases in the frequency and severity of climate-driven disturbances, widespread changes to surface water extent, and alterations in vegetation structure and function. Environmental change in this region is increasingly affecting society in a variety of ways, including impacts on forests from insects and fires, erosion of Arctic coastlines, and changes to wildlife habitat and ecosystems that affect subsistence opportunities and economic uses. Research conducted as part of ABoVE to address ecosystem vulnerability in these systems will involve observations, process-oriented analyses, scientific syntheses, and modeling. Emphasis will be on research that integrates data collected by airborne and spaceborne sensors with information obtained from field studies and ground-based observations. The study will address questions that are associated with processes that are critical to understanding the environmental and societal impacts of climate change in Arctic-boreal ecosystems, as well as ecosystem responses that in turn affect trajectories of future change in the region and/or feedback to the global climate system. ABoVE will contribute to the priorities of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), conducting research that responds to specific calls for research that advances understanding of vulnerabilities in human and biogeophysical systems and their relationships to climate extremes, thresholds, and tipping points (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/m-12-15.pdf    ). This research will require:  integrated cross-sectoral, biogeophysical, and socioeconomic observations, as well as improved simulation and modeling. Specific areas where progress is needed include:  observations to detect trends in extremes, integration of observations into models, attribution of change to human or natural causes, integrated research on Earth and human systems; simulation and prediction at spatial and temporal scale conducive to decision making; and adaptation responses to changing frequency and intensity of extreme events. The ABoVE Science Definition Team (SDT) members will spend approximately twelve to fifteen months refining the science questions and issues to be addressed and developing a detailed study design for the ABoVE field campaign. The SDT will be supported in its efforts by the Terrestrial Ecology Program at NASA Headquarters and the ABoVE support team within the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems (CC&E) Office at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The work of the SDT will culminate in a report that will serve as the Concise Experiment Plan NASA will use to guide its implementation of the field campaign (for an example, please refer to the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia Concise Experiment Plan at http://cce.nasa.gov/terrestrial_ecology/above/index.html    ). 2. Science Definition Team for ABoVE 2.1 ABoVE SDT Structure The ABoVE SDT will consist of approximately 8-20 members with expertise in scientific disciplines relevant to the goals of ABoVE. These include, but are not limited to ecology, biogeochemistry, ecohydrology, geography, land surface climatology, and the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Members also will have expertise in the methodologies to be used: satellite, airborne, and in situ observations; data analysis; data synthesis; data management; and modeling. It will be desirable for some members of the SDT to have knowledge of and experience working in northern high latitude ecosystems and/or experience in applying scientific knowledge to decision making in the region. NASA also will be looking for members who have a demonstrated ability to work well as constructive, engaged members of a collaborative, interdisciplinary team. The Terrestrial Ecology Program Manager will make a recommendation to the Selecting Official for a Chair or Co-Chairs of the ABoVE SDT from the selected SDT members. The NASA Terrestrial Ecology Program Manager and possibly other agency representatives will be ex officio members of the ABoVE SDT. NASA is currently seeking and discussing partnerships with other organizations in the conduct of ABoVE. There is also the possibility that partnerships may develop to involve ABoVE in a broader, multidisciplinary field program in the Arctic. If such partnerships are realized, NASA may ask its ABoVE SDT members to also engage in the scientific planning for the combined activity, joining with the scientists representing the scientific interests of the partner organizations. NASA is not anticipating that such interactions will add significantly to the burden of work to be undertaken by the ABoVE SDT. 2.2 ABoVE SDT Responsibilities The members of the ABoVE SDT will provide NASA with scientific assistance in developing a Concise Experiment Plan for the ABoVE field campaign.  This plan will include the science questions to be addressed, a compelling rationale explaining the scientific and societal importance of the study, the research approach/strategy, a reasonably detailed study design and description of required field and remote sensing observations, required field infrastructure, logistics, and data management capabilities. NASA's charge to the SDT will be to design a regional, Arctic-boreal terrestrial ecosystem research project to be conducted in western North America, including Alaska, that is faithful to the scope and primary objectives described in the Revised Executive Summary for ABoVE. The ABoVE Scoping Study Report included details regarding study design and management as a proof-of-concept demonstration of feasibility. The SDT will be free to adopt those recommendations or further consider, refine, and/or alter the study design to best address ABoVE goals and objectives. The SDT will be charged to identify the particular societal issues that will be studied in ABoVE, with the understanding that these will likely require the incorporation of complementary social and natural science perspectives and methods. The SDT will be charged to design a study that leverages, complements, and is compatible with ongoing Arctic-boreal research projects and field observations of national and international organizations working in the region. The NASA field campaign can then focus on filling gaps in scientific or geographic coverage and providing integrated regional analyses through effective use of satellite and airborne remote sensing, geospatial data analysis tools, and integrative data synthesis and modeling studies. The initial meeting of the ABoVE SDT will be targeted for late January 2013 and will be a teleconference call (for planning purposes, proposers should hold the afternoons of January 24 and 28 for a one and a half hour teleconference call to be scheduled on one or the other of those two days). The SDT can be expected to meet in person four times over the twelve to fifteen months following SDT selection. Meeting duration will be for (typically) two to three days. The SDT also may have regular phone-in meetings. Meetings will be called and their agendas set by the SDT Chair in coordination with NASA HQ and CC&E Office management to ensure that planned activities are aligned with programmatic needs and expectations. NASA will support travel expenses for all ABoVE SDT work. Salary and other financial support will not be provided to SDT members. The CC&E Office will be responsible for any tasks necessary to support the work of the ABoVE SDT. All reports and other output of the ABoVE SDT will be made publicly available. Once the SDT's work has concluded, it will be disbanded prior to any solicitations for the field campaign being issued by NASA. 2.3 ABoVE SDT Membership Proposal Content Response to this Call is in the form of a Letter of Application. In the letter, the applicant should provide evidence of expertise and knowledge in areas highly relevant to the ABoVE primary scientific goals and related research activities. The types of expertise and knowledge desired were listed in section 2.1; however, appropriate expertise is not limited to the examples given there. All applicants must explain the knowledge and skills they have to offer and why they are important for SDT activities. Letters of application should provide a brief statement regarding which aspects of the ABoVE study the applicant would be able to help develop, as well as their overall vision regarding the scientific direction and scope of the field campaign. Applicants may express an interest in serving as SDT Chair (or co-Chair), but NASA will not limit selection of the SDT Chair to those applicants who express interest. The Letter may contain a brief list of references to scientific or technical papers the applicant has published and/or positions held and work conducted that establish her/him as a leader in their area(s) of expertise. The Letter should also contain a statement of how much time the applicant will commit over the next twelve to fifteen months for activities related to the ABoVE SDT, particularly if there are any major constraints that may restrict full engagement in the significant amount of work that will be required to define the scientific approach and study design for the ABoVE field campaign. Letter applications are invited from individuals, not groups. Collaborations and teams are not solicited. Each Letter is to be limited to three pages, with 11-point (or larger) font and one-inch margins. The subject line of a responsive application must read "NASA ABoVE SDT Application."  Letter applications submitted by E-mail are preferred, but may also be submitted by regular mail or fax. Responses to this invitation must be received no later than 4:30 PM EST on December 14, 2012. 3. Selection of the ABoVE Science Definition Team NASA expects to select approximately 8-20 individuals for membership on the ABoVE SDT and plans to announce its selection in January 2013. NASA will select the ABoVE SDT members and the SDT Chair from the pool of respondents after reviewing the letters received in response to this call.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENERAL:</span>
<p>This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) and is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is it a Request for Quotes (RFQ). The government will NOT award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and WILL NOT be publicly released.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this RFI are NOT offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND AND SCOPE:</span></p>
<p>The Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Policy Coordination and Public Affairs (CA/P) has a requirement for a Social Media Engagement and Promotion Platform Engine. The Period of Performance: Base 12-months plus Four 12-months Option Years. The NAICS code for these services is:&nbsp; 519130.</p>
<p>The CA/P New Media Unit cultivates and manages the CA message across all online and mobile platforms, reaching both foreign and domestic publics, the media, and other government agencies. The Consular Affairs New Media Unit focuses on digital outreach regarding the safe travel of U.S. citizens abroad, support for our Embassies and Consulates throughout the world, and promotion of Department-wide public diplomacy efforts. The New Media Unit manages www.travel.state.gov and the @TravelGov social media brand, all of which is interlinked and connects back to one another.</p>
<p>Social Media communities are established and cultivated in advance so as to build a following of engaged customers. This allows CA to then take to social media to amplify emergency messages for U.S. citizens. Travel Warnings are issued (travel.state.gov), when long-term, protracted conditions that make a country dangerous or unstable lead the State Department to recommend that Americans avoid or consider the risk of travel to that country. A Travel Warning is also issued when the U.S. Government's ability to assist American citizens is constrained due to the closure of an embassy or consulate or because of a drawdown of its staff.</p>
<p>CA/P requires a Social Media Platform that can assist with parsing out information for different audiences through a media social network (Facebook) across multiple platforms from anywhere around the world. This Social Media Platform will be managed by CA/P staff.</p>
<p>The features for the Social Media Platform MUST included ALL of the following components:</p>
<p>- Project Management <br />- User generated content and challenges / promotions <br />- Advanced Messaging <br />- Message scheduling <br />- Page Management and layout tools <br />- Advanced Analytics <br />- Twitter Accounts and linkage <br />- Facebook Page Administration <br />- On call dedicated Account Manager <br />- Social Media Strategist <br />- Custom Reports tailored for CA/P <br />- Account Permissions <br />- Full Branding Control <br />- Multiple and tiered Users and Administrators <br />- Audience Targeting <br />- Ad integration</p>

Please bring a laptop or notebook computer that will display product(s) and show how it works. You WILL NOT be allowed to interface any of your equipment with the Department of State computer system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:</span></p>
<p>All responses need to be provided in an electronic format (.PDF preferred). Font should be Times New Roman, size 12, and not to exceed five (5) pages.

<DESC><p>Solicitation Number/Title<br />DOD Central Cancer Registry Program <br />Notice Type:<br />Sources sought <br />Synopsis:<br />The Healthcare Acquisition Activity-JTF Capmed, at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), Bethesda, Md, intends to issue a firm-fixed-price contract for continued development of a consolidated (Central) cancer registry function in support of the Department of Defense Cancer Surveillance Program. The Joint Pathology Center (JPC) has a requirement to develop, implement and manage a central cancer registry to ensure high quality cancer data in conjuction with the Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR) system, which is the DOD specific software application for cancer data collection (see attached Performance Work Statement).<br />ACTUR, as part of DODs Cancer Surveillance Program and the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), is a hospital based application and data repository. This system due to its unique and broad population base, has the potential to be a powerful tool for incidence and mortality reporting, measuring and monitoring patterns and standards of care and treatment outcomes. In order to nurture and maintain a research quality database, the continuance and maintenance of a DoD central registry function modeled after Public Law 102-515 is vital.<br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 621399 and the size standard is $7 million dollars. All responsible sources may submit a response. A determination made by the Government to not compete this requirement will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested firms may identify their interest in writing to the Government point of contact.<br />Responses to this notice must be received no later than 10:00 AM EST, 15 Nov 2012.<br />Oral, facsimile and telephone inquiries are not acceptable in response to this notice. The point of contact for this action is Patricia Bruce at Patricia.Bruce@us.army.mil.<br />Contracting Office Address: HCAA, JTF CapMed (NARCO), WRNMMC, Bethesda, MD 20889-5000.</p>

	NORTH TEXAS HEALTHCARE  SYSTEM, DALLAS, TEXAS
ITEM	DESCRIPTION
1	Item 0270-0103-20; Rb-82 Generator

For Elution of Rubidium Chloride
Rb 82 Injection
Diagnostic: Intravenous
DESCRIPTION
Cardiogen-82 (Rubidium Rb 82 Generator) contains accelerator produced strontium Sr 82 adsorbed on stannic oxide in a lead-shielded column and provides a means for obtaining sterile nonpyrogenic solutions of rubidium chloride Rb 82 injection.  The chemical form of rubidium 82 is 82RbCl.  The amount (millicuries) of Rb-82 obtained in each elution will depend on the potency of the generator.  When eluted at a rate of 50 mL/minute, each generator eluate at the end of elution should not contain more than 0.02 microcurie of strontium Sr 82 and not more than 0.2 microcurie of strontium Sr 85 per millicurie of rubidium chloride Rb 82 injection, and not more than 1 microgram of tin per mL of eluate.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Rubidium Rb 82 decays by positron emission and associated gamma emission with a physical half-life of 75 seconds.

External Radiation
The specific gamma ray constant for Rb-82 is 6.1 R/hour-millicurie at 1 centimeter. The first half-value layer is 0.7 centimeter of lead (Pb). For example, the use of a 7.0 centimeter thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1,000.

Strontium Sr 82 decays to rubidium Rb 82 with a strontium Sr 82 half-life of 25 days (600 hrs). The Sr-82 is produced in an accelerator by proton spallation of molybdenum, Mo (p, spall) Sr-82 or by the reaction Rb-85 (p, 4n) Sr-82. The Sr-82 produced has no carrier added. 

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Following intravenous administration, rubidium Rb 82 rapidly clears the blood and is extracted by myocardial tissue in a manner analogous to potassium. In human studies, myocardial activity was noted within the first minute after injection. When areas of myocardial infarction are detected with rubidium chloride Rb 82 injection, they are visualized within two to seven minutes after injection as photon-deficient or "cold areas" on the myocardial scan. Uptake is also observed in kidney, liver, spleen, and lung.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Rubidium chloride Rb 82 injection is a myocardial perfusion
agent that is useful in distinguishing normal from abnormal
myocardium in patients with suspected myocardial infarction.

Cardiogen-82 (Rubidium Rb 82 Generator) must be used
with an infusion system specifically labeled for use with the
generator and capable of accurate measurement and delivery
of doses of rubidium chloride Rb 82 injection not to exceed a
single dose of 2220 MBq (60 mCi) and a cumulative dose of
4440 MBq (120 mCi) at a rate of 50 mL/min with a maximum
volume per infusion of 100 mL and a cumulative volume not to
exceed 200 mL. These performance characteristics reflect the
conditions of use under which the drug development clinical
trials were conducted.
Adequate data from clinical trials to determine precise localization
of myocardial infarction or identification of stressinduced
ischemia have not been collected.
Positron emission tomographic (PET) instrumentation is recommended
for use with rubidium chloride Rb 82 injection.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
General
As with all radiopharmaceuticals, only the lowest dose of
rubidium Rb 82 necessary to obtain adequate visualization
should be used. A lower dose provides less patient radiation
and is consistent with the achievement of ALARA. Most procedures
do not require use of the maximum dose of rubidium
Rb 82; the dose to be used should be carefully individualized
and factors such as:
age;
body size;
anticipated pathology;
degree and extent of visualization required;
structure(s) or area to be examined;
disease processes affecting the patient and;
equipment and technique to be employed;
should be considered.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for
particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration

2	Patient Infusion Lines (25 lines per package)

The contractor will be paid/reimbursed for inpatient services under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved DRGs based prospective payment system that encompass ICD-9-CM classifications (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modifications).  Medicare payments for inpatient health care services will be under the prospective payment system (PPS).  The DRG rate includes the cost of all non-physician hospital inpatient services, i.e. bed and board, nursing services, use of hospital facilities as referenced in 42 CFR 409.10 and CT scans, hemodialysis, prosthetic items, pacemakers, laboratory and X-ray services, etc., including those which the hospital must purchase from another facility.  Associated ancillary claims will be processed and paid based on current CFR payment methodology.  No separate billing or payment should be made for these services.  Inclusion or exclusion of services will be determined by Medicare PPS rules and regulations as published by CMS.
 
 Contractor is expected to meet or exceed a level of ICU nurse staffing such that a minimum of one ICU competent nurse per three Veteran patients is met at all times.  Staffing ratio and competencies will be subject to review by VARHCS Nurse Executive or delegate.
 
 Requirement of ancillary services (Respiratory Therapy; Laboratory; Imaging services):  Ventilated patients are expected to have competent, certified Respiratory Therapy services consistent with the community standard of care.  All Respiratory Therapy services are subject to standard quality assurance activities as within the VA.  Laboratory, Diagnostic and Imaging services are required to be readily available for critical decision making for the contract staff, open to review by VA staff and meeting or exceeding standards for timeliness and accuracy.  All Laboratory, Diagnostic and Imaging services are subject to standard quality assurance activities as within the VA.
 
 Offers from prospective contractors must accept CMS reimbursement as the base form of payment. Therefore, all offers must be presented in the form of a percentage discount of the CMS rate.  The admissions identified in the CLINs below are estimated workload projections.
 
 Veteran patients who receive care at the VARHCS sometimes have clinically complex conditions that exceed the ability of the VARHCS to deliver care commensurate with the needs of the patient.  At the present time, the VARHCS does not have an ICU, but has an average of one patient per day in ICU level treatment. VARHCS requires that Department of Veterans Affairs physicians coordinate transfers of eligible Veterans into and out of the contracted facility.

Offerors with the capability to satisfy this requirement should respond to this Notice and to send an email to edward.delaney@va.gov, with subject line "Roseburg ICU Sources Sought" and a brief description of capabilities in the body of the email.

**This is not a Solicitation.  This is a Request for Information (Sources Sought).***

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.<br />B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>The following clauses are incorporated into the solicitation in full text:</p>
<p>52.27-103-72 DOJ CONTRACTOR RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT BUREAU OF PRISONS (JUNE 2004)</p>
<p>For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:<br />1. Legally resided in the United States (U.S.);<br />2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or<br />3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.<br />If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S. The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm<br />By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 26540.2F (NOV 2008)</p>
<p>Department of Justice (DOJ) Order 2640.2F prohibits the use of non-U.S. citizens in the performance of this contract or commitment for any position that involves access to or assisting in the development, operation, management, or maintenance of any DOJ Information Technology System. By signing this contract or by beginning performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>52.24-403-70 NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)</p>
<p>Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.</p>
<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are <br />listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required; <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1(a) and 1(b) above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.</p>
<p>3. Intermittent Contractors:</p>
<p>An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.</p>
<p>5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM's instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code <br />"3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. [End of Clause]&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)</p>
<p>During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor work force will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency <br />periods. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.</p>
<p>The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: <br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. <br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. <br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. <br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. <br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. <br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. <br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. <br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.&nbsp;<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. <br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2. Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, in the Federal Acquisition Regulations. [End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.232-99 Providing Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (Deviation) (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012.<br />(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.<br />(b) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.<br />(c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;ADDITIONAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Contractors are advised that the Contracting Officer will verify registration in the System for Award Management database (www.sam.gov) and the company's Representations and Certifications prior to award of any contract by entering the potential awardee DUNS number into the database. Failure to complete the registration may result in elimination from consideration for award.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

There is a new transceiver that became available in October that will allow us to install antennas that span the entire width of the river versus the current system<br />that only spans half that distance. This will greatly improve our straying estimates and so we want to get the equipment installed as soon as possible in order to record the PIT-tagged steelhead that will start returning in November 20 12. NMFS has already obtained all the necessary pennits for installing the new system.<br /><br />NMFS&nbsp;need help to get this installed quickly and &nbsp;want to contract a company to install government furnished PIT -tag antennas, IS 1001 transceivers and the associated master controllers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also want&nbsp; the Contractor to&nbsp;maintain the site for 3 months with the optional task of having the Contractor maintain the site for 4 more months. Maintaining the site will require I trip per month to the site to check on the equipment and potentially having to move equipment before it i,s damaged by high water or ice conditions.<br /><br />Base&nbsp;task 1 <br /><br />1.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (FEB 2012)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

In describing the internal design of MFLTS software, the software architecture must be sufficiently detailed to show support for the replacement of components of the MFLTS software modules with minimal impact to other components in the modules or to operating systems.</p>
<p>Respondents should include a specific example(s) of how the software architecture has been used to develop language translation software products.</p>
<p><br />Please review the attached MFLTS Software Architecture Specification, and follow the steps provided above and the time line as outlined below:</p>

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Family of Field Medical Equipment (FFME), wishes to determine industry capabilities in providing a Field Anesthesia System (FAS). MARCORSYSCOM is also interested in reviewing possible design options, performance test &amp; evaluation results, material solutions for these systems, and all Food &amp; Drug Administration certifications (510K) obtained.
<p>The FAS shall be a portable, field ruggedized and modernized anesthia machine that will replace the existing draw over vaporizer. The FAS device shall deliver volatile anesthia agents to a patient in conjuction with a flow through or circular breathing system. The FAS shall be lightweight (no more than 10 pounds) and compact ( no more than 3000 cm3) and shall meet operational characteristics whether carrier gas is Oxygen (O2) or Nitrous Oxide (N2O) and operate during a transitory change in the composition of the carrier gas. Performance and integrity of the components of the FAS shall not be degraded due to exposure to liquid and gas forms of volatile anesthetics Isoflurane and Sevoflurane. Indicators and graphical user interfaces shall simultaneously show data (information of the type of anesthetic agent, target concentration, reservoir level, power level and error messages) to the care provider. The FAS shall be compatible with current ventilators fielded by the United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC). The device shall be used in field hospitals and institutional settings by trained physicians and anesthesiologists in the medical field.</p>
<p>Responses must identify planned capabilities or modules not yet available for sale, testing, etc. For such planned capabilities or add-on modules, provide the development and implementation schedule to bring the capability to the marketplace. In the event a device does not have FDA certification, provide the notional schedule for obtaining 510K approval for all devices, modules, or capabilities requiring such approval.</p>
<p>For information about Family of Field Medical Equipment systems see the MARCORSYSCOM website at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/cse/</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit capabilities and experience descriptions, design approaches, design concepts and any other relevant information to MARCORSYSCOM. Firms should also submit business size information. This information shall be submitted no later than&nbsp;5 Dec&nbsp;2012 to Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN: Telly Simons, CSS, CTO25, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, Va. 22134. This information may also be submitted to telly.simons@usmc.mil.</p>

All data received in response to this announcement marked or designated, as corporate or proprietary information will be protected from release outside the Government in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act provisions. The sources sought announcement is requested for informational purposes only. This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), Invitation For Bid (IFB), Request For Quotation (RFQ), or an announcement of a solicitation. No solicitation document exists. The submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure these items, nor does the Marine Corps intend to award on the basis of this sources sought/market research or otherwise pay for the information requested.

Since this is a fielded design no substitutes will be allowed for the designed kits otherwise all previous units would need to be replaced and or reset which in turn would raise the required quantity of kits by an order of magnitude without even accounting for the design approval and supportability concerns.

<DESC>U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution<br />Justification for contracting without full and open competition
<p>Contract for neutral services with Meridian Institute</p>
<p>The following document is prepared in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and FAC 97-02, October 23, 2012 (6.303). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:</p>
<p>1.Identification of the agency and the contracting activity:<br />Udall Foundation <br />U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution<br />130 S. Scott Ave.<br />Tucson, AZ 85701</p>
<p>2.Nature and/or description of action being approved:<br />The purpose of this sole source justification is to justify and document the procurement of neutral services from Meridian Institute (Meridian) for planning, coordinating and facilitating the Northeast Regional Planning Body (RPB) process under a firm fixed price contract.</p>
<p><br />3.A description of supplies of services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):<br />The services include planning, convening, coordinating, facilitating, and documenting four meetings for the Northeast RBP, as well as meetings with the Northeast RPB Secretariat, and ongoing coordination and communication in between RPB meetings. Direct costs include materials, meeting facilities, audio/visual, video taping services, and facilitation team travel. The total cost for this contract is $132,988.</p>
<p><br />4.An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:<br />Other than full and open competition is authorized by FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) because there is "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>5.A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited:</p>
<p>A mediation/facilitation team with (a) demonstrated experience facilitating and organizing large processes which include challenging and complex issues among a variety of stakeholders, including state and federal agencies, Tribes, and other stakeholders with varying backgrounds, (b) knowledge of and experience with ocean issues and uses in the Northeast, (c) experience with providing electronic meeting technologies to enhance virtual meeting participation, (d) in close proximity to the project, (e) is available to work on the project at the time of award, (f) is cost effective, and (g) credibility as a neutral entity among the range of stakeholders associated with the Northeast RPB, was required for this project. The Meridian Institute is uniquely qualified to provide the services needed based on the following:</p>
<p>1.The Meridian Institute team has valuable relationships with key stakeholders in the region from previously facilitating a national CMSP workshop as well as a regional CMSP planning workshop that included many of the individuals who will participate in the RPB process. This is an important consideration in the costs of start-up for a new contractor who would need additional time to establish those relationships, understand the needs and concerns of all parties, and gain a comparable level of trust.</p>
<p>2.The Meridian Institute team has worked on National Ocean Policy, facilitated the National and Northeast Workshop on CMSP, and is currently facilitating the CMSP regional planning process in the Mid-Atlantic. In doing so, they have gained a clearly unique depth of understanding regarding the National Ocean Council's policy goals and potential process challenges for the RPBs. This unique experience will streamline planning processes for the Northeast RPB, resulting in time and cost savings.<br /><br />3.The Meridian Institute meets or exceeds the qualifications for Environmental Conflict Resolution professionals established for the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution Roster of Practitioners. The Meridian Institute has a strong past performance record on U.S. Institute projects.</p>
<p>6.A description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many sources as is practical, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required in Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:<br />This notice is being issued in accordance with FAR 5.201 and FAR 6.305 (a) and (d)</p>
<p>7.A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>Meridian's rates negotiated under the GSA MOBIS schedule for qualified staff are $231/hr for a Mediator/Facilitator 4 (Senior), and $121 for a Mediator/Facilitator 2 (Associate). These rates are used in the proposed contract with the Meridian Institute. The U.S. Institute has data on the rates charged by the Roster qualified senior facilitators in the Northeast. Those rates range from $185 per hour to $285 per hour. The project budget proposed by Meridian results in an hourly rate in the middle of this range for the senior facilitator assigned and an hourly rate for less experience personnel comparable to rates charged by other Roster members with similar experience.</p>
<p>Meridian's total budget estimate was reasonably comparable to the independently developed government budget for the project, based on U.S. Institute experience with comparable work. Based on these factors, the cost to the Government is fair and reasonable for the services required by the agency.</p>
<p>8.A description of the market survey conducted (Sec. 7.101) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:<br />Market research of 35 practitioners were assessed for this project. The majority of those practitioners are on the Institute Roster of ECR Practitioners. A survey of hourly rates for practitioners in the region was used to develop a budget estimate.</p>
<p>9.Other factors supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br />None</p>
<p>10.Listings of any sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:<br />Bickerman, Coastal Vision, Consensus Building Institute, Eastern Research Group, Gosline-Singer Keystone, Keystone , Logue Group, and Naturesource Communications</p>
<p>11.Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the services required:<br />Future work related to this project will be solicited through GSA MOBIS or the open market.</p>
<p>12.Certification</p>

<DESC>The CFFT II is a lightweight, rapidly deployable, observed fire training system that provides simulated battlefield training for Fire Support Specialists, Joint Fires Observers (JFO), and Soldiers at the institutional and unit level. There are three configurations of the CFFT. The 1:4 version comprises one Instructor Station physically connected to the four Forward Observer (FO) Stations where one instructor can train four students. The 1:12 version includes one Instructor Station and 12 FO stations. The 1:30 version comprises one Instructor Station physically connected to the 30 FO Stations. This FMS requirement via the requiring activity, Bahrain Defense Forces, will utilize the 1:12 system.
<p>The CFFT II system (In Accordance With DA PAM 350-9) allows commanders flexibility to conduct Observe Fire training in a controlled environment and provides the capability to conduct Observed Fires rehearsals and training without using live ammunition. This system is the only US Army certified system to train tasks related to Observed Fires. The system provides advanced distributed learning, simulated military equipment, virtual environments, and computer generated forces. Deploying units have limited access to live fire ranges and are not able to maintain proficiency in critical tasks required for Observed Fires. The CFFT Forward Observer Trainer fulfills this training requirement. "Close Air Support" (CAS) a newly added training module, is a subtask of Observed Fires and has been identified as a critical training requirement for units entering hostilities / contingency environments.</p>
