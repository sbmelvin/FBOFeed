The following factors which are of equal importance and shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) technical acceptability and (2) price. This evaluation shall be based on information provided by the contractor. The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the Capabilities Statement or quotation, but may do so at its discretion. Please carefully review the commercial item FAR clauses for information about requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation. Capabilities Statements that do not include prices for all items will not be considered. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offeror- Commercial Items (JAN 2005); FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is considered to be most advantageous to the Government, considering technical acceptability, user training, past performance, and price. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions; therefore, it is critical that each quote be fully responsive. However, the SEC also reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined to be necessary, with offerors making the competitive range (i.e., the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for the purposes of efficiency). FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (MAR 2005) - all offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with their quote; FAR clause 52-212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items (OCT 2003); FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (JUL 2005) - in paragraph (b) the following clauses apply; 52.203-6 Alternate I, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-41, 52.222-43, 52.222-44, 52.232-33, 52.232-36, 52.239-1.

Clauses incorporated by reference may be accessed in full text at www.arnet.gov. The lessor/contractor will agree to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause in all contracts/subcontracts. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS - Upon award of the contract, the contractor, primary subcontractor(s), key supervisory personnel, and/or any other contract individuals designated by the FBI, who require access to any FBI information, facility, or property, must accurately complete Standard Form SF-86, "Questionnaire for National Security Positions," (Revision 9/95) and two copies of Form FD-258 (fingerprint card).  All other contract individuals must furnish requested biographical information to appropriate FBI personnel and accurately complete FD-816, "Background Data Information Form," Form FD-484 (Privacy Act Acknowledgement), and two copies of Form FD-258 (fingerprint card).  These forms and information are to be completed and furnished to the FBI at least 25 workdays prior to the arrival of contract individual to the site of the work under the contract.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure all contractor personnel are in full compliance with applicable Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Department of Justice, Employment Eligibility Verification requirements, such as those set forth in Title 8, U.S. Code, Section 274a.

A background investigation, the scope of which will be at the discretion of the FBI, will be conducted on these individuals.  At the discretion of the FBI, contract individuals may also be interviewed by the FBI (or FBI contract investigators) regarding foreign travel, associates, residences, or other matters of concern to the FBI in deciding whether to grant access to its information, facilities, or property, and may be requested to undergo a polygraph examination to fully resolve any security concerns.  Refusal or failure to accurately complete the forms, to be interviewed, or to undergo a polygraph examination to resolve any questionable matters will be deemed reasonable cause for denial of access to FBI information, facilities, or property.  Lack of candor may also be a strong factor for denial of access.

Access to FBI information, facilities, or property will be granted only where such access is clearly consistent with the mission and responsibilities of the FBI.  If for any reason a contract individual is denied access to any FBI information, facility, or property, the FBI will not disclose to the contractor the reason for denial and will only make such disclosure to the affected contractor employee pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information or Privacy Acts.  The FBI will not be liable for any expense in the replacement of the individual or any costs incurred by the contractor as a result of such denial.  It is the policy of the FBI that these individuals already be employed by the contracting organization/individual (i.e., that the individual's employment not hinge upon an access or security clearance determination by the FBI) and the FBI will assume no liability between the contracting organization and its employees as a result of this procedure.

The FBI reserves the right to revoke any contract individual's access to its information, facilities, or property where such access is no longer clearly consistent with the FBI's mission and responsibilities, and the contractor agrees to immediately remove that individual from the work-site under such circumstances.  In cases of access revocation, the FBI will inform the individual of the basis for the revocation, unless to do so would reveal classified or sensitive information, and give the individual an opportunity to explain, rebut, or refute such basis in writing.  Access will remain revoked pending prompt review of any such submission by the individual.

The FBI reserves the right to reinvestigate contract individuals on a periodic basis (usually every five years) or where facts or information indicate the continued access may no longer be clearly consistent with the FBI's mission and responsibilities.  The scope of any reinvestigation will be at the sole discretion of the FBI.  Refusal or failure to accurately complete any necessary forms, to be interviewed, or to undergo a polygraph examination to resolve any questionable matters during a reinvestigation will be deemed reasonable cause for revocation of access to FBI facilities, information, or property.

Appropriate badges may be furnished by the FBI authorizing escorted or unescorted access to FBI facilities and property.  The badge, if furnished, will be kept at a location to be determined by the FBI and shall be picked up by the contract individual granted access upon arrival at FBI premises.  Consistent with life/safety factors, it shall be worn at all times on the upper part of the body so as to be clearly visible and will be returned to the FBI whenever the wearer leaves FBI premises for any reason or any length of time.  The FBI may require all contract and subcontract individuals to execute a security awareness briefing form, FD-835, "Security Acknowledgement Form."

Upon request, the contractor will provide, for approval by the FBI, written physical security procedures and policies to be followed by contract individuals for access to the project as well as security measures taken by the contractor to prevent unauthorized entry by contract individuals during off-duty hours.

All quotes from responsible sources will be considered. Quotes shall be accepted by email only.  Quotes shall be emailed to lmtheisen@fbiacademy.edu no later than 9:00 AM EST, September 6, 2005. No other methods of submission will be accepted.

<DESC>The Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture seeks to purchase household based retail food purchase scanner data for the years 2002-2004 to conduct research on the economics of interactions between consumers’ purchasing behavior and food retailing.  This research is in support of the Department’s programs and policies. (Examples of current objectives are outlined below.) 

In addition, ERS seeks to purchase custom analyses on an ad-hoc basis.  These analyses would focus on specific issues and the influence they may be having on specific food products, market conditions, demographic groups, or any combination of the above-mentioned items.  (For example, what is the influence of changes in labeling guidelines on consumer purchase behavior for specific products or categories?)

Findings are often disseminated by publishing in a variety of outlets such as academic journals, applied economic journals, ERS technical bulletins, ERS agricultural economic reports, etc.  (ERS does not disseminate or publish proprietary, firm, or establishment level data.)  
In addition, ERS conducts staff analyses for internal use.  Internal staff analyses are conducted for the Administration, the Congress, or the Department of Agriculture. 
ERS occasionally enters into cooperative agreements and memorandums of understanding with academics at Universities to assist us with research priorities and the implementation of economic analyses.  The work may require that we grant access to the data.  However, the agreements require that the data not be released to any other party and that the data be returned to ERS upon completion of the work.  Cooperators are restricted by the provisions of the contract and may not publish or report any portion of the raw data, and may only publish results from the economic analyses.  The estimated period of performance will be from the date of award through September 30, 2007.

Specific research goals and objectives include:
1.	Investigate the impact of USDA's National Organic Program on product differentiation and household demand for differentiated milk products (organic, non-rBGH, and conventional). 
2.	Identify what price households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased.
3.	Identify differences in food prices across markets in the U.S. and analyze the impact the increasing number of alternative retail outlets for food on food prices and accessibility.
4.	Investigate the effect of different tastes and preferences across households on food demand.
5.	Measure the impact of consumer food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services, and assortment.
6.	Investigate the impact of the increasing number of value added food products on food marketing firms and agricultural producers.

Tasks	1.  ERS seeks a demographically and geographically representative sample of U.S. household-based food purchase scanner data.  The data shall contain purchase and demographics for the years 2002-2004 and be ready for delivery on or about January 1, 2006.  Cost estimates should be provided per year of data.  This data shall include individual transaction level information that would cover food purchases by each household for all food store outlets available to a household and identify the store from which each item is purchased.  In addition, identification of any food products labeled ‘organic’, ‘whole grain’, or low-carbohydrate should be clearly identified.  This project requires coverage of all major food categories that have UPC codes including meats, poultry, fish, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, and dry grocery.  Sampling and expenditure weights shall be included in order to aggregate measures both nationally and per local market for individual food products and aggregated food groups.  Data should be delivered on CDs and should contain the data in plain text or SAS Files.

In order to undertake the research that is planned, we require a complete description of sample design. In addition to sample weights, other relevant data (such as strata and clusters) should be included.

2.  A data description dictionary that provides a full explanation of any abbreviated terms in the data and a listing of all the available common characteristics for categories within each department should be included in the delivered package.
 
For each transaction observation we require all relevant information regarding the transaction as well as all available information on the product purchased and the household that purchased the product (see below).

<DESC>The Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture seeks to purchase a geographically and demographically representative sample of U.S. household-based data on food purchases at restaurants, fast-food establishments, and other businesses selling prepared foods (food away from home or FAFH for short).  These data are needed to support research on economic issues related to the nutrition and health of the U.S. population.  The importance of these data for understanding food choices and nutritional outcomes has been growing as Americans’ expenditures on FAFH expands.  

Findings are often disseminated by publishing in a variety of outlets such as academic journals and ERS publications.  (ERS does not disseminate or publish proprietary, firm, or establishment level data.)  
In addition, ERS conducts staff analyses for internal use.  Internal staff analyses are conducted for the Administration, the Congress, or the Department of Agriculture.

The estimated period of performance will be from date of award through September 30, 2007.


Research  Goals and Objectives	Specific ERS research goals and objectives include:

1.	Identify differences in FAFH consumption by region and customer/household demographics (including income, education level, age, and presence of children).
2.	Measure the effect of FAFH prices on food choice by region and customer/household demographics.
3.	Assess how low-income households differ in the FAFH choices they make and the prices that they pay.
4.	Assess how households’ FAFH choices change through their life cycle.  For example, households with young children tend to favor fast food restaurants over sit-down restaurants.  Older Americans are known to eat out less frequently than young adults.
5.	Investigate the effect of different tastes and preferences across households on food choices.  
6.	Investigate the effect of different menu options on food choices.  
7.	Compare measures of food purchase behavior to measures of food purchase behavior in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. 




 


Tasks	1.  ERS seeks a geographically and demographically representative sample of U.S. FAFH purchase data.  These data should include individual or party transaction level data for food purchased at restaurants, fast-food establishments and other businesses selling prepared foods for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004.  The data should include a list of foods purchased by customer/party per eating occasion, total dollar sales by customer/party per eating occasion, average price paid per unit by customer/party per eating occasion, and information on whom within the party intends to consume the product.  The data should include estimates for these measures both for all commercial establishments categorized by type (such as fast food, cafeteria, sit-down restaurants, take out places, etc )  Data should be delivered on CDs and should contain the data in plain text or SAS Files.

These data should include a description of the FAFH universe.

For each transaction observation ERS requires all relevant information regarding the transaction as well as all available information on the product purchased and the household that purchased the product (see below).

<SUBJECT>B -- Data on retail food purchases to support analytical intelligence
<SOLNBR>ERS-KLN-2005-004
<RESPDATE>091705
<ARCHDATE>10022005
<CONTACT>Kathy Newton, Purchasing Agent, Phone 202-720-7478, Fax 202-720-3987, Email knewton@ars.usda.gov - Kathy Newton, Purchasing Agent, Phone 202-720-7478, Fax 202-720-3987, Email knewton@ars.usda.gov
<DESC>The Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture seeks data on retail food purchases to support analytical intelligence for the Office of the Secretary on current issues, concerns, and trends in the retail food market.  These data are needed to identify the changing trends for broad categories of food products including both fixed- (e.g., frozen orange juice) and random-weight (e.g., ground beef) items.  
 
Data needs consist of quarterly updates containing aggregate summaries of the most recent measures (available with a 4 to 6 week lag), quantities purchased, and total sales volume for various food products (see attached list) on a national, regional, and market (where available) basis across the U.S.  

In addition, ERS seeks to purchase custom analyses on an ad-hoc basis.  These analyses would focus on specific issues and the influence they may be having on specific food products, market conditions, demographic groups, or any combination of the above-mentioned items.  (For example, what is the influence of low-carb diets on sales of bakery products and new product introductions?)

The data and custom analyses will be used to prepare a quarterly report for the Office of the Secretary and data and analysis will also, when relevant, be used in research leading to publications in academic journals, applied economic journals, ERS technical bulletins, ERS reports, etc.  (ERS does not disseminate or publish proprietary, firm, or establishment level data.)  In addition, ERS conducts staff analyses for internal use.  Internal staff analyses are conducted for the Administration, the Congress, or the Department of Agriculture. The estimated period of performance will be from date of award through September 30, 2007.

	Specific ERS research goals and objectives include:
1.	Produce timely analysis on trends in the retail food market.
2.	Identify differences in food prices across markets in the U.S.
3.	Measure the impact of food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services, and assortment.
4.	Compare measures of food purchase behavior to measures of food purchase behavior in the Consumer Expenditure Survey. 
5.	Determine the types of foods that U.S. households purchase by demographic segment with specific focus on low-income households and how they differ from other demographic groups.
6.	Identify the prices that households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased.
7.	Assess how low-income households differ in the food choices they make and the prices that they pay for food.

ERS occasionally enters into cooperative agreements and memorandums of understanding with academics at Universities to assist us with research priorities and the implementation of economic analyses.  The work may require that we grant access to the data.  However, these agreements require that the data not be released to any other party and that the data be returned to ERS upon completion of the work.  Cooperators are restricted by the provisions of the contract and may not publish or report any portion of the raw data, and may only publish results from the economic analyses. 

	1.  The contractor shall provide a geographically representative sample of U.S. food purchase data.  It will include quarterly data starting with the third quarter of 2005 and continuing through the second quarter of 2006.  This data will be aggregated quarterly data that is representative of food purchases on a national, regional, and market level (where available) for all stores where food is commonly purchased.  The data must include measures for average price paid per unit, total quantities purchased, total dollar sales, and percent changes from previous quarter, and year ago quarter for each of these three measures. The data must include estimates for these measures both for all stores, as well as for specific store types or retail channels.  Data must include all major food categories specified in the attached list which include meats, poultry, fish, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and dry grocery products (see attached list).

2.  The contractor shall provide analytical support for 3 to 5 special requests based on the most recent data on prices and quantities purchased.  For example, information on unanticipated, high-profile issues, such as BSE, or the effects of the low-carbohydrate diets on food purchase behavior.  These analyses will provide ERS with the ability to quickly obtain attitude, health, and knowledge information from household panel participants through both current existing data and customized survey questions used to collect new data.  Acceptance standards will be clarified for each request for analysis at the time of the request.  Data should be delivered on CDs in Excel Spreadsheet files or SAS Files.  The data shall be delivered in four quarterly data deliveries between November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2006 and 3-5 custom analysis throughout the year.
 
To undertake planned research, we require a complete description of sample design. In addition to sample weights, other relevant data (such as strata and clusters) should be included as well as a data description dictionary that provides a full explanation of any abbreviated terms in the data.

<DESC>TOP OF THE ROCK CLUB (TORC)
Food Services Concessionaire Contract

Lajes Field is seeking a food service provider who can provide quality service, a variety of food choices, flexibility in schedule, and creativity in managing the food portion (the bar and beverage portion will not be contracted out) of the Top of the Rock Club (TORC) in Bldg T-121 on Lajes Field.  

The TORC’s mission is to provide sit down family dining experiences, official dining functions, special occasion functions, a meeting place, and a social gathering place for Lajes Field personnel.  There are approximately 2,000 military and family members, 100 U.S. civilian workers, 1,000 local nationals’ employees, and 1,000 Air Base 4 employees and families authorized to use the TORC facilities.  

The TORC currently provides daily and nightly meals, regularly hosts monthly meetings and ceremonies that may include light refreshments, special functions, and holiday functions.  

There are currently several other places for employees and families to eat on Lajes.  These include:

Burger King, a fast food restaurant that serves hamburgers and chicken

Ocean View Island Grill, which serves pizza, hamburgers and other American style food

Subway, which serves hot and cold sub sandwiches

Frank’s Franks, which serves hot dogs and nachos

Sargentos, which has two locations and serves traditional Portuguese food.

The TORC operations should not compete with the above restaurants on base but instead should provide an alternative place to eat that offers a variety of items.  

The TORC currently uses an Air Force approved menu program and recipe cards to plan for meals.  The contractor will be required to use the revised Air Force Clubs Core Menu program available via compact disk will be provided prior to the solicitation closing date of September 13, 2005 for Phase I, upon request.     Please contact the 65th Contracting Office using the contact information contained at the end of this synopsis to acquire a copy of the compact disk listing Menu Items, formats, etc.  This is not mandatory or required information, just good information to have at your request.   

We are looking for a contractor who can creatively and efficiently manage the food operations portion of the TORC and meet the needs of Lajes Field personnel.  The Contractor’s proposal should include a variety of food types to satisfy our customer’s desires, but it should not be just Portuguese food.  A core menu items list is included as Attachment 8 entitled, “Mandatory Core Menu Items List” of this solicitation.  The contractor has the flexibility to propose how they would manage the food operations portion.  

The Government will furnish the building, kitchen equipment, utilities, etc., in accordance with Attachment 4 entitled, “Statement of Work”.  A site visit with a question and answer session with club management and base senior leadership was held August 24, 2005.  Questions and answers are posted as Attachment 11 entitled, “Industry Day” Meeting Minutes to allow all offerors a better understanding of this requirement aid in developing their proposal.   

“This is a nonappropriated fund purchase and it does not obligate appropriated funds of the United States Government. Nonappropriated funds are generated by the military community through the sale of goods and services and the collection of fees and charges for participation in military community programs. This purchase does not involve federal tax dollars.” 

A site visit will be conducted on a by request basis to provide an opportunity to view the existing food service facilities and operations. Interested parties have an option of attending a site visit on September 7, 2005 between the hours of 14:00 – 15:00.

<DESC>The government anticipates awarding a contract to manage and operate the Air Force Publishing & Distribution Center (AFPDC).  The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and will include a basic year plus four (4) annual option periods.  This acquisition will be solicitated and award utilizing FAR subpart 12, Commercial Acquisitions, procedures.  The solicitation will be unrestricted.  The applicable North American Industry Classification code is 561110 ($6.0 size std).  Offers will be evaluated utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPTO) procedures.  The Government intends to award without discussion but reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary in making the award decision.  Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Offerors may submit on-line Representation and Certification Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.  Techniques utilizing past performance information and price will be evaluated; therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror.  The solicitation will be made electronically at http://www.eps.gov on or about 22 Jul 05, with a closing date for receipt of offers on or about 8 Aug.  Facsimile, telephone, or written request for the solicitation package will not be honored. The RFP issue date is an estimation of the date on which the solicitation will be made available.  However, the solicitation may be posted before or after this projected date.  Offerors must submit proposals following the format prescribed in FAR 52.212-2, Instructions to Offerors.  The Contractor must submit two (2) complete paper copies of the proposal plus one complete electronic version compatible with Windows XP (zip disk not acceptable).  Offerors must be registered in the CCR (http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil) to be eligible for award.  Since this requirement includes options, FAR 52.232-19, Availability of Funds Next Fiscal Year, applies.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligations.  Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation.

Delivery FOB-Destination to NSWCDD within 10 days of order award.  Standard commercial documentation/manuals and warranty shall convey.  This 3D electronic simulation software has the following minimum salient characteristics:  ·	The required software product will enable the Navy to simulate the interference between antennas installed on a ship platform and the installed performance of the antenna (return-loss and radiation pattern).  ·	The software will utilize the 3D TLM method, so that large complex problems can be handled and compact models for wires, apertures and composite panels integrated with the field solution.  ·	The software will use octree-based multi-griding enabling fine grids to be mixed with coarse grids, to minimize the overall problem size.  ·	The software will enable the Navy to simulate the effect of Radar Absorbing Materials.   ·	The solver will be available for 64-bit parallel computing platforms to enable scalability. In addition to the salient characteristics, the requirement is considered sole source because the Flomerics software is a proven technology for Navy programs.  Alternative software would require the Government to engage in software re-design (with the cost of new software, software testing, and engineering analyst training) that would be additive to the price of the current requirement for specified software and substitution of a new software product would be expected to result in schedule slippage. The Government will consider statements, from all responsible sources, which evidence capability to provide the required items within the required delivery schedule, submitted via email to XDS13@nswc.navy.mil:  please reference synopsis number N00178-05-Q-3064 when responding.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding expression and genetic studies, as well as epidemiological investigations on materials and biospecimens from Italian Families, with Dr. Paola Minghetti, Department of Dermatology Bufalini Hospital, Via Ex Tiro a Segno, 6, 47023 Cesena (FC), Italy.  The contract will be for a base year plus one (1) option period. 

The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  

Cutaneous melanoma is a very complex disease. Fair pigmentation, low tanning ability, germline mutations in susceptibility genes, and many melanocytic nevi or dysplastic nevi (DN), are important risk factors for melanoma. However, these risk factors may lead to melanoma formation through multiple pathways. Evidence for a genetic role in melanoma development has been described in families with at least 2 affected individuals among their first-degree relatives (high-risk families).  NCI has already successfully conducted a case-control study and a family study at the Maurizio Bufalini Hospital, Cesena, Italy with Dr. Minghetti. The patients referred to the Bufalini Hospital include more than 85% of the melanoma patients of the area. NCI needs to recruit participants for this current requirement from the same area of the previous studies, in order to compare the results with those obtained in subjects with similar background, history of sun exposure, and genetic make-up.  Dr. Paola Minghetti has collaborated in the past with NCI and has acquired expertise in the practical aspects involved in the collection of epidemiological data, photographs, informed consents, and biospecimens, according to NCI standards and needs, and has access to medical records from the Bufalini Hospital, which is crucial for this study.  Dr. Paola Minghetti in collaboration with the NCI shall recruit participants, administer questionnaires, provide blood collections and skin tissue collections along with Dr. Donato Calista at Maurizio Bufalini Hospital in order to continue the research.  Dr. Paola Minghetti is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the services required to continue supporting this study. Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the current study in progress.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on September 12, 2005.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis (LHC), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: microRNA Molecular Profiling of Human Cancer (Colon) with the Ohio State University Research Foundation, M376 Starling Loving 320 W 10T, Columbus, Ohio 43210.  

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

Recent studies have indicated that the microRNA expression profiles are very informative in reflecting the developmental lineage and differentiation state of the tumors and are superior in classifying tumors as compared to cDNA expression profiles, 
The laboratory has previously collected a cohort of 500 clinical specimens from our ongoing colon and lung cancer case-control molecular epidemiology study.  NCI currently has an on-going collaborative study of lung and colon cancer with Ohio State, in which microRNA expression profiles identify tumor from normal, different histological types of tumors and predict prognosis. NCI has preliminary data indicating that certain microRNAs affect the WNT pathway and certain microRNAs are regulated by the p53 tumor suppressor.  The WNT and p53 pathways are critical in the molecular pathogenesis and progression of human colon and lung cancer.  

Ohio State University (OSU) is collaborating with the NCI with similar services to perform the microRNA expression profiles of these samples using their second generation of microRNA arrays. The proposed collaboration project is essential to provide consistency of expression profiles in microRNA from different types of human cancers, which will undoubtedly allow us to make the best comparison to determine specific and common changes important in human neoplasms.  It is imperative that these investigations are continued without interruption and further validated in a large patient population.

Ohio State University is the only source known to the NCI that is a pioneer and worldwide expert in this new area of cancer research.  OSU has developed a unique platform for the quantitative analysis of microRNAs.  OSU will utilize the novel, customized microRNA array facility at OSU in order to perform expression profiling of microRNA expression profiling of human cancer.  The initial results of this ongoing study indicate the potential to identify cancer at an early, more treatable stage and to predict prognosis.  Therefore, it is imperative that these investigations are continued without interruption and further validated in a large patient population.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for two 4pi Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy Systems.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from 4Pi Analysis, Inc., Durham, NC, for two Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) Systems capable of producing qualitative and quantitative elemental x-ray spectra, x-ray dot maps, and digital images, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. The proposed EDS system is manufactured by 4pi Analysis, Inc.  It is imperative that this system be procured to ensure full standardization with other MSFC-owned EDS equipment being utilized on five existing electron microscopes owned by MSFC.  Each microscope is outfitted with a 4pi EDS system to perform quantitative elemental analyses, x-ray mapping and digital imaging.  This standardization ensures consistency of analytical results across all microscopes since the same computer code will be utilized for spectral quantification.  In addition, standardizing on a single system increases laboratory throughput when performing time sensitive manned flight hardware analyses because the breakdown of a single EDS system can be compensated by the continued operation of the others without additional training.  2.  Market research reveals that 4pi does not sell through distributors and is the only known source that can fulfill the Government’s requirements.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for 100 each of an INVAR 36 polar boss and 20 each of a water soluble ASTM mandrels. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Advanced Composite Technologies and Associates (ACTA)on a sole source basis. ACTA have developed a process for producing the mandrels with high reliability. This involved a vacuum oven cure cycle and hydraulic press compaction. It would be difficult to transfer this knowledge and experience to another vendor. ACTA has already produced a mandrel that is now being utilized at NASA for an all-composite cryogenic tank structure, therefore compatibility is essential. ACTA already has the drawings for the polar bosses and has produced them for NASA on another effort, plus the ACTA machine shop has the Computer Numeric Control (CNC) program on file which will result in a large cost savings and can deliver the hardware in a timely fashion. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Janet Appleton later than 4:30 p.m. CST time on 9/9/2005.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<SUBJECT>58--CONVERT MSFC'S DIGIRAY X-RAY SYSTEM TO A MOTIONLESS LAMINOGRAPHY SYSTEM

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the conversion MSFC's existing Digiray X-Ray Laminography System into a state-of-the-art 64 sensor Motionless Laminography X-Ray System.   NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Digiray Corporation, 317 Hartford Rd, Danville, CA. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  Digiray manufactured the X-Ray source.  It is unique in that the X-Ray beam scans across the face of the tube and is synchronized with the acquisition of data from the detectors.  The upgrade to the system requires proprietary information about the operation of the X-Ray scanning source.  Only Digiray Corporation has this information regarding the X-Ray source. 2.  Digiray has active patents that cover the Digital Laminography, the Pan and Zoom on the system, auto matching and auto finding of the sensors, and source gradient removal.  The first patent is on the basic process of the X-Ray source moving with stationary sensors and processing to generate slices through the part being inspected.  The second patent concerns image processing of the slices and images.  The remaining patents concern the calibration of the sensors and X-Ray source.  These patents prevent other firms from building a similar system. 3.  Digiray is the only known source that can fulfill the Government's requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Access board standards located at url:	 http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12  necessary to ensure compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 applicable to this acquisition are Section 1194.21 and 1194.26.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to compete a requirement currently being performed by Family Health International (FHI) under Contract No. N01-AI-05403.  This solicitation is being issued under full and open competitive procedures.  DMID supports extramural research to diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases caused by virtually all human infectious agents except HIV.  DMID supports projects spanning the entire spectrum of biomedical research from early basic research through phase III clinical trials.  Through the contemplated contract, DMID intends to establish and maintain an International Clinical Studies Support Center (ICSSC).  The primary goal of the ICSSC is to enhance the capacity of international clinical sites to perform clinical research in accordance with international standards, such as the International Conference on Harmonization’s (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and to facilitate the planning and conduct of clinical evaluations of interventions against infectious disease.  Studies that require support include epidemiologic studies and clinical trials that range from small, early phase trials to large multi-center efficacy trials. These studies are conducted throughout the world, primarily in Africa, South and Central America, and Asia.  The primary focus of this solicitation is assistance and site development activities rather than regulatory compliance or monitoring activities as these services are provided under other DMID-funded contracts.  The activities of all concerned contractors will be coordinated by DMID staff.  Work to be performed will include: assessment of the readiness of sites to conduct clinical studies; development and design of clinical protocols; training in clinical research design and conduct, including GCP and ethical issues, data management, statistical analysis, and safety monitoring and; logistical/operational aspects of managing the DMID international clinical research portfolio.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about July 20, 2005, and require an estimated 4 FTEs with expertise consistent with the operations of a project of this size and complexity. This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 15, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to award of a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   EPA intends to award a sole source procurement on or about September 19, 2005, to Russell Fairey/Coastal Conservation and Research, Inc., pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1):--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The U.S. EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Exposure Research Laboratory has a need for collection of specimens of estuarine invasive species found in California, Oregon, Washington (USA) and British Columbia (Canada).  Russell Fairey and Coastal Conservation and Research, Inc.,  have the special expertise, training, and unique and precise knowledge in the field of estuary ecology and experience in sampling near-shore species across Pacific coast estuaries, to perform the Statement of Work.    Statement of Work:  This research involves the collection of specimens for  tissue samples from near-shore estuarine environments.  The contractor shall conduct geographic sampling of localities known to support populations of the following estuarine invasive species of concern: Nippoleucon hinumensis, Mya arenaria, Pseudopolydora paucibranchiata, Pseudodiaptomus marinus,  Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Melita nitida, Jassa marmorata, Grandidierella japonica, Nematostella vectensis, Bugula stolonifera. Specimens of the aforementioned species shall be collected at specific localities (to be identified in the contract).  At least 5 to 50 individuals of each species shall be  collected at the identified sampling localities. Because the abundance and distribution of the aforementioned species may vary geographically and temporally, the contractor shall consult with the project officer on the feasibility of collecting specimens of all listed species pending an initial  assessment of species occurrences and relative abundances at collection localities to be identified. In the event that one or more of the aforementioned species cannot be suitably collected at the majority of the identified collection localities, the species shall not be collected and suitable  alternatives shall be identified by the project officer. A final list of species and sites shall be compiled and agreed upon before further sampling commences.  All specimens taken shall be stored in 95% ethanol in a non-breakable and re-sealable container. All specimens shall be shipped to the US  EPA Molecular Ecology Research Branch at 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45268. Samples shall be accompanied by a sample information report that includes information on when the sample was taken, which location the sample was taken from, and general conditions and personnel  associated with the sampling event. Shipping of samples shall be expedited (e.g. next-day delivery) and must follow standard requirements for transport of hazardous chemicals. Shipment of samples shall be done no longer than five business days after being collected.  The level of funding for this  contract shall support costs associated with specimen collecting, including, but not limited to, research and sampling supplies, travel expenses, salaries for field assistants, and time commitments from highly trained personnel.   Technical/Scientific Criteria:  For any offeror to be considered  qualified to conduct this study, the following areas are identified (of equal importance) and must be addressed in the capability statement:  (1) knowledge of Pacific coast estuarine invasive species biology related to habitat use, distribution and abundance (2) geographical expertise and knowledge  of Pacific North America coastal regions as related to the biogeography of estuarine and marine species distributions (3) expertise in collecting scientific specimens from benthic sediment, rocky intertidal, fouling, semi-aquatic vegetation, shallow water column and deep water column habitats.  The  capability statement must also address the qualifications of personnel, including the description of specific, relevant experience and availability of personnel in providing services similar in scope to those described in the Statement of Work.  Offerors will be evaluated on the adequacy of the  types of personnel who will form the team, their experience, and their educational background.  Disciplines expected to be needed to complete the effort include, but are not limited to: marine biology, community ecology, and oceanography.  Any past performance for similar work completed during the  past three (3) years and those currently in process must also be provided.   No Request for Quotation is available and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of  this notice to Karen Watson at the above address for consideration by the Agency.  Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the technical/ scientific criteria.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is  sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose  of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the government, a purchase order will be placed with Russell Fairey/Coastal Conservation and Research,  Inc.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is issued as a Request for Quotes; RFQ5069.  This RFQ is not a small business set aside. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 325414 and the small-business size is 500.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is soliciting quotations from offerors to acquire suitable Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) to be use in tissue culture for the production and evaluation of numerous viruses.  The objective is to ensure that viral vaccine candidates produce in tissue culture containing FBS are safe for the eventual administration to humans.  The contractor shall provide a lot of four hundred (400) bottles of five hundred (500)ml each of traceable United State origin serum to be close system collected at least three times 0.1um filtered and then pooled prior to bottling.  It must be non-irradiated and non-heat treated, bacterial, fungal and mycoplasma contamination must be below 15mg/dl and it must be bovine virus panel tested negative.  Two (2) or more lots must be available for testing in the labs assays for selection of a good lot.  If initial tested lots do not prove to be adequate for the labs assay and growth requirements, additional lots meeting the specs must be provided for testing.  NIAID wish to purchase 400 bottles of FBS.  FBS is both a critical and widely variable component, which is added to media for supporting the growth of cells and viruses in the laboratory.  Due to variations in the source, collection and processing FBS lots vary widely within companies and between companies.  That means each lot must be tested individually to check for the necessary characteristics for the laboratory requirements.  It is critical that a large amount of serum is purchased from a single lot to maintain the reproduceability of research experiments and avoid variations caused by variability between lots.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation–Commercial Item; FAR 52.212.3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; and FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  The Government intends to select the offer that represents the best value to the Government, price and all other factors considered.  In order to be considered for an award, offeror must have completed the online electronic Representatives and Certifications located at (http://orca.bpn.gov/) in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a).  By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR at (www.ccr.gov/) prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.  Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), September 12, 2005 to Mrs. Tawana Parker.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS) Project Office (G-AIS). This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the USCG to acquire any products or services.  The USCG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested.  Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary.  The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.  In compliance with the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) 2002, emerging maritime security requirements, and the need to improve vessel traffic services (VTS) and navigational safety, the USCG is developing an NAIS that will support Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) over the Nation’s navigable waters and adjacent sea areas.  MDA is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States.  AIS is an international protocol which adheres to the International Telecommunications Union Sector for Radiocommunications (ITU-R) Recommendation M.1371-1 standard for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore, and shore-to-ship communication of information, including vessel identity, position, speed, course, destination and other data of critical interest for navigation safety and maritime security.  AIS equipment is required domestically and internationally aboard many commercial vessels.  The information provided by NAIS will support most of the nation’s maritime interests, including the safety of vessels and waterways through collision avoidance and traffic management, safeguarding the nation through detection, identification, and classification of vessels from within national waters to thousands of miles offshore.  NAIS will complement other surveillance and intelligence systems that aid the essential process of identifying vessels requiring further investigation and action.  NAIS information will be displayed in command and control (C2) systems that receive USCG national maritime Common Operational Picture (COP) feeds, along with data and intelligence correlated as appropriate, with data from other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and federal agency sources.  NAIS information will also be available to federal, state, and local port partners in support of security and safety operations.   NAIS will consist of an integrated system of AIS equipment (e.g., receivers, transmitters, antennas, etc.), data storage, processing, and networking infrastructure.  The intention of the NAIS Project is to use existing infrastructure and interoperate with other systems, federal agencies, and entities, as much as possible.  External systems will be included in the context of NAIS services, e.g., command and control (C2) systems, law enforcement databases, vessel traffic services (VTS), and notice of arrival databases, for the purpose of sharing infrastructure, quickly implementing capabilities, and improving performance.  NAIS has the capability of sending and receiving AIS messages, via a Very High Frequency (VHF) Data Link (VDL), to and from AIS equipped vessels, Aids to Navigation (ATON), and Search and Rescue (SAR) aircraft.  NAIS may leverage several types of platforms to support AIS receive and transmit infrastructure (e.g., towers) or receive-only infrastructure (e.g., aircraft).  AIS message data shall be transported over a wide area network (WAN) utilizing diverse, remote site connectivity (e.g., leased T-1 circuits, microwave, fiber optics).  NAIS shall process (e.g., validate, filter) and store AIS-provided vessel track and static data.  External systems shall be enhanced to provide data processing functions (e.g., vessel tracking correlation, intelligence processing, and anomaly detection), user interfaces, and indirect access for some NAIS users (e.g., USCG Deepwater assets, public and port partners).  All solutions shall be certified and accredited for compliance with all U.S. Federal, DHS, and USCG information assurance policies.  Preliminary high-level functional requirements are outlined as follows.  RECEIVE/TRANSMIT:  NAIS shall provide the capability to receive and transmit AIS messages via the VDL to and from all AIS equipped vessels within ports, navigable waters, and coastal areas out to 24 nm.  The system shall also be able to receive some AIS messages out to 2000 nm of the baseline from which U.S. territorial waters are measured.  Receive and transmit capabilities shall operate on all AIS channels as defined in ITU-R M.1371-1.  The AIS network shall consist of AIS reception and transmission sites; these sites may be completely separate or combined.  Monitoring and management of message traffic, frequency usage and interference throughout the area of required coverage shall be provided.  Methods of detecting and locating an interferer with AIS messaging and frequencies; and mitigating spoofing and jamming will be incorporated.   NETWORK:  The network shall route and transport data between AIS base stations, user interfaces, data processing capabilities, and external users.  A plan for Spectrum authorization/management shall be provided (See NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management). INTEROPERABILITY: NAIS shall leverage USCG enterprise architecture components to provide interoperability among USCG and external entities’ networks, databases, and systems.  Users may access AIS-related capabilities via external systems.  DATA PROCESSING:  NAIS shall store, retrieve, archive, and recover vessel data received, created, modified, and transmitted.  NAIS may leverage an existing data warehouse.  NAIS shall automatically verify and validate AIS data (e.g., position reports) through comparison with other AIS received information (e.g. time difference of arrival) and with other available independent sensors and data sources.  USER INTERFACES:  NAIS shall provide user interfaces (to the extent possible incorporated with or as modules of existing and planned command and control, analysis and information retrieval systems) for data analysis, system administration, and AIS message management.  The data analysis user interface shall include a means for users to query historical data via the archive.  Existing systems shall support vessel identification & tracking, vessel inspection & target selection, vessel traffic management, vessel movement analysis, maritime incident investigations, ATON and SAR.  ADMINISTRATION: NAIS shall provide network administration, system diagnostics, and physical status monitoring and alarm capabilities.  Each installation shall monitor its own performance and condition.  System monitoring capabilities shall not interfere with or degrade normal system functions.  NAIS may leverage existing administration capabilities and facilities (e.g., network operations center).  Software and network administration shall include the capability to monitor the health of the centralized software and network that is receiving and processing the data transmitted from remote sites/platforms as well as the capability to monitor system security in order to preserve the integrity of the AIS data received (current and historical). The USCG invites industry to respond with information regarding existing and planned capabilities for technical solutions, components, and implementation strategies similar to requirements being considered and described in this RFI.  The USCG is also interested in the technical feasibility and state of the market for achieving such requirements. The Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI. Due to a variety of limitations, the USCG does not plan to entertain questions related to the substance of this RFI. Industry days, pre-solicitation, and/or pre-proposal conferences may be held, pending the level of interest. Industry is advised that Government support contractors will review non-proprietary information.  Responses to this RFI can be submitted no later than July 28, 2005 to Ms. Eleni Jernell (G-ACS-5D) via email at ejernell@comdt.uscg.mil or via mail at U.S. Coast Guard, 1900 Half Street SW, Washington, D.C., 20024, Attn: Ms. Eleni Jernell (G-ACS-5D).  Questions related solely to the transmittal of a response should be directed to Ms. Jernell at (202) 475-3298. Responses received after July 28, 2005 may not be reviewed. Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to solicit a proposal from and negotiate a contract with JMS Naval Architects (JMS), for a comprehensive Research Vessel Inspection Program for NSF and University-owned vessels that participate in the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).  UNOLS is an organization of 61 academic institutions and national laboratories involved in oceanographic research and joined for the purpose of coordinating oceanographic vessels schedules and research facilities.  One of the primary functions of UNOLS is to ensure the efficient scheduling of scientific cruises aboard the 25+ research vessels located at 20 operating institutions in the UNOLS organization.  Many of the cruises result from grants issued by NSF for scientific research.  Many of the vessels in the UNOLS fleet are owned by NSF and/or heavily dependent upon NSF for vessel operations and maintenance funds to support the scientific research.  It is, therefore, incumbent upon NSF to ensure that the highly specialized research vessels are fully mission-capable, safe, and seaworthy.  The Research Vessel Inspection Program is essential to maintaining the capability of the research fleet in carrying out NSF’s mission.  JMS Naval Architects possesses specialized expertise in what is required of UNOLS research vessels for the safe and successful performance of ocean science.  This expertise includes a highly specialized knowledge of science systems required for ocean research, as well as research ship design and operations.  JMS Naval Architects’ ties to the UNOLS community and familiarity with the UNOLS fleet of research vessels has been integral to the critical cross flow of information among vessel operators in the conduct of oceanographic research.  The Independent Government Cost Estimate for the anticipated four-year period of performance is not expected to exceed $500,000.  This announcement is provided for informational purposes only and is issued under the authority of FAR 6.302.  See Note 22; substitute 15 days for 45 days.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Kaiser Foundation Research Institute, 3800 N. Interstate Avenue, Portland, OR  97227 to finalize the control population for an ongoing case control study to evaluate the progression from endometrial hyperplasia (EH) to cancer.  DCEG is conducting a study of the progression from endometrial precursors to endometrial carcinoma, the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States.  Endometrial hyperplasia (EH), a pathologic diagnosis that covers a spectrum of entities, sits somewhere along that progression, but its natural history is largely unknown.  This study combines over 30 years’ worth of epidemiologic, clinical, histopathologic, and tissue-based data to directly address the major obstacles to a better understanding of EH as a surrogate endpoint for endometrial cancer.  This is the continuation of work and is needed due to unanticipated challenges in identifying and selecting controls for this study.  The objectives of this procurement are to:  1) Confirm that each potential control remains at-risk of uterine cancer for at least 1 year after her stratum-specific censoring date (or each stratum-specific censoring date, for controls who appear in multiple strata); 2) Over-sample available controls with CAH at index biopsy, to accommodate the expected level of misclassification of EH type among selected controls who are diagnosed with CAH; 3) Preserve an equal probability of selection for each control in strata whose age- and date-matching criteria are expanded, by reviewing extra controls, if necessary; and 4) Incorporate these data into the controls datasets and  overall study datasets.   Kaiser Foundation Research Institute is the only vendor known to the DCEG that can finalize the control population for this ongoing case control study.  There is no other contractor that has the access to this population and the expertise to finalize the control group for this study.   This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.     All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 12, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Yale University School of Medicine, 310 Cedar Street, PO box 208023, New Haven, CT 06520 to continue to construct tissue microarrays (TMAs) of breast tumors and associated non-invasive breast tissues from the DCEG’s population-based case-control study in Poland to investigate the etiology of breast cancer.  Tissue Microarray (TMA) technique, which permits the analysis of hundreds of tissue samples simultaneously using just a few slides, is ideally suited for epidemiological studies and Yale University has built TMAs for 840 invasive breast cancer tissues collected in the Polish case-control study.  In addition Yale University has successfully been able to build high-quality TMAs containing non-invasive targets from breast tissues collected in the Polish study and has been able to demonstrate that the TMAs were satisfactory for immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent detection of estrogen and progesterone receptors.   In this continuation study Yale University will continue to build TMAs of invasive breast cancer by arraying all eligible blocks collected from the Polish case-control study and build TMAs from non-invasive breast tissues including “normal” terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) collected from both invasive and “normal” blocks in the Polish study.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, it is the Government’s intent to award a sole source agreement for facility upgrades within a unique underground leased facility. The Office of Personnel Services (OPM), Centers for Federal Investigative Services (CFIS) is located in a lessor’s facility that is governed by mine safety regulatory statues. OPM, CFIS deems it appropriate to award a fixed price agreement on other than a full and open competitive basis to Iron Mountain Records Management, Inc. The basis for this award is that no other contractor can reasonably provide the services within this facility. The lessor regulates access and controls all renovation projects within the facility domain therefore use of another contractor would incur statutory liabilities and substantial additional/duplicated costs that the government could not reasonably expect to recover through competition. Furthermore, any delay in accomplishing the agency’s mission requirement would lead to detrimental degradation within the facility space. This is not a solicitation for proposals, an invitation for bids, or a request for quotations. Furthermore, it does not represent a commitment by the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement. This is not a solicitation for offers but rather a notice of OPM’s intent to award a sole source agreement. This notice is for information only, and may represent the only official notice.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No agreement will be awarded on the basis of quotations or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the purchase will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed agreement based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Detailed capabilities shall be submitted to OPM, CFIS; 1137 Branchton Road; Boyers, PA 16018-0618; ATTN: Bradley Holtzapple, by 12:00pm EST, September 16, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>DESC:  Section I.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.3 Research & Development as described below. Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines se t forth herein. This Research Announcement (RA) constitutes the total solicitation. There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding these requirements. INTRODUCTION: As the Army moves forwar d to upgrading the Current Force, significant improvements in efficiency and affordability of aviation platforms are needed.  To provide aviation platforms the increased range and payload capabilities required for the Future Force, advanced drive system te chnologies are necessary. The goals for the next generation aviation platforms are defined in the DOD's Rotary Wing Vehicle (RWV) Technology Development Approach (TDA). To ensure that aviation platforms are effective and affordable, the Army intends to dev elop and demonstrate critical technologies between FY06 and FY10 such that these technologies are available for transition into product improvement programs for existing air vehicle platforms that will be a part of the Army's Future Force.  The Government' s strategy to achieve this, is to conduct a Technology Demonstration (TD) at the component/subsystem level during the FY06-10 timeframe. The Enhanced Rotorcraft Drive System (ERDS) will develop and demonstrate critical drive system technologies necessary t o achieve the next phase of the RWV TDA goals at the component/ subsystem level by FY10. This TD will be executed as a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) preferably that is a Cooperative Agreement pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2358. This TD is focused on the de velopment and demonstration of the critical technologies needed to maximize the potential for technology transfer to the US Armys Current/Future Force aircraft. Therefore, it is the Government's desire to conduct Component/Subsystem Level Technology Demon strations using a Current Force (US Army) aircraft drive system as a baseline, to the maximum extent possible. The period of performance for this TD is approximately 54 months. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The ERDS program is focused upon developing critical per formance and affordability enhancing drive system technologies for the U.S. Army's Current/Future Force fleet of rotorcraft. The rotor drive systems of the U.S. Army's currently fielded rotorcraft are extremely heavy, consume a large portion of the vehicle s empty weight, and thus negatively impact the payload and range characteristics of the vehicles. The rotor drive system is an assembly of very high precision mechanical components with demanding manufacturing and quality requirements. Current systems have high parts count, making the total production costs high. Once fielded, the drive s ystems have proven to be a major source of operating and support costs due to less than desired component durability, susceptibility to corrosion and high cost of overhaul. The noise emitted by rotorcraft drive systems is extremely high and at a level dama ging to the human ear. Noise at this level (+100Db) also distorts voice communication, and accelerates fatigue of the crew and passengers. The ERDS program will consist of design, fabrication, and demonstration testing of critical drive system technologies  required to achieve the program goals for the Army's Current/Future Force fleet of rotorcraft. The ERDS program goals are a 40% increase in drive system transmitted horsepower-to-weight ratio, 15dB reduction in drive system generated noise, 30% reduction in drive system production cost, 30% reduction in drive system operating and support costs, and 75% automatic detection of critical mechanical component failures. Offerors will be expected to develop a methodology that justifies the selection of critical t echnologies to be pursued and estimates their contribution to the overall p rogram goals. Design, fabrication and testing of these critical component technologies shall be conducted to demonstrate the specific weight, durability, noise, production cost, and O&S cost attributes of the components. Offerors will also be required to d evelop a methodology for assessing and refining the accuracy of the analytical tools developed or utilized for the design, analysis, and manufacturing of the selected critical components.  The methodology shall be validated based upon the comparison of pre dicted performance and operating characteristics against those actually measured during component testing. Demonstration testing should be representative of the expected aircraft operating environment and be of sufficient scope to validate the weight, fati gue, durability, and noise characteristics of the technologies.  DELIVERABLES: All contracts awarded under this solicitation will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Management/Program Plan; (2) Design Review Briefing Charts; (3) Test Plans; (4) Test Reports; (5) Bi-monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports; and (6) Final Report.  All deliverable data may be in the format selected by the contractor.  Additionally, a final briefing at Fort Eustis, VA, shall be presented. Section II. Award Information:  ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Anticipated period of performance is 54 months total with 51 months for the technical effort and an additional 3 months for completion of the final report. The Government fun ding for the program is $14.9 million distributed by Government fiscal year as follows: FY06, 700K; FY07, 2M; FY08, 4.2M; FY09, 4.5M; FY10, 3.5M. Proposals must follow the guidelines described in this solicitation. TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  Due to the c ommercial application of this technology, the Government anticipates and award of a TIA (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  It is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  TIAs with, to the maximum extent practicable, cost participation of 50% a re anticipated because the technology has dual-use potential and performers of the program will benefit from commercialization.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance wi th the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link:  http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/ 32106r_041398/part34.pdf.  This RA will remain open until 4:00 p.m. Eastern time December 16, 2005. Awards under this announcement are anticipated to be made by March 31, 2006.  However, unless the offeror specifies a different expiration time, proposals w ill be considered valid for Government acceptance through 31 May 2006. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received. Further, the Government reserves the right to select for award only a portion of an offeror's proposal (i.e., certain tasks vs. total program). Multiple proposals from the same offeror that address different solutions or that address only part of the problem under the announcement will be accepted and evaluated independently. Section I II.  Eligibility Information:  Participation in the project announced in this RA is limited to U.S. firms as prime recipient.  The RA is not set aside for small businesses.  Section IV. Application and Submission Information:  This RA contains the total so licitation.  No special application kits/forms/materials are required.

<SUBJECT>30 -- Rectifier Transformers for the AGS Main Magnet Power Supply
<SOLNBR>AGSTXF1
<RESPDATE>091605
<ARCHDATE>10012005
<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>**********This Modification is being issued as notification that the closing date for the acceptance of bids has been extended from 4:00 PM, 09 September 2005 until 4:00 PM, 16 September 2005.***********

Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) operates a fully controlled 72 MW DC power supply, which energizes the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) Main Ring Magnet system.  The Magnet system represents a 0.75 Henry, 0.25 Ohm load.  The controlled rectifier assembly is feed from a 95 MVA Motor Generator Set through eight phase shifting / step-down rectifier transformers.  The secondaries of each of these transformers are bifilar wound, so that there are 16 secondary windings in total.   BNL will solicit bids to replace the existing rectifier transformers with new units.  It is critically important that the prospective Vendor have extensive experience with rectifier transformer of this size and service and a thorough understanding of how these transformers interact with the Motor Generator set.  The prospective Vendor shall insure that the new Transformers are completely compatible with the existing rectifier modules and the Motor Generator Set.  The Vendor shall build and thoroughly test and document the transformers.  BNL will install the transformers with engineering supervision by the Vendor.  The Vendor shall participate in the commissioning and turn on of the systems after the new transformers are installed.

Operating Parameters:
The Transformers will be operated 24 hours per day 7 days per weeks 10 months per year.  The operating cycle will drive the rectifiers to full rectify and then to full invert continuously with a repetition rate of from 1 cycle per second to 1 cycle in 10 seconds.  During each cycle power will flow from the transformers to the magnet load and then from the magnet load back through the transformers to the Motor Generator Set.  In one typical cycle the DC current will rise from 200 amperes to 6000 amperes in 500 milliseconds and then immediately return to 200 amperes in an additional 500 milliseconds.  This cycle will repeat every 1.1 seconds.  In another cycle the current will rise from 200 amperes to 4500 amperes in 500 milliseconds and stay at 4500 amperes for 6 seconds and then return to 200 amperes in 500 milliseconds.  This cycle will repeat every 9 seconds.  The transformers must be designed and braced to handle this service, including the harmonics generated by the rectifier modules.  The transformers must fit the footprint of the existing transformers.  Any modifications required to the existing transformer yard will be prohibitively expensive.   

Specific requirements for the transformer are:
1)  		Eight phase-shifting / rectifier transformers each with bifilar secondary windings.  These transformers will be housed in four tanks suitable for outdoor service.
2)		Four transformers shall be rated at 7500 volt (input), 431 volt (output), 2.65 MVA.  These shall have appropriate phase shifting for 24 pulse rectifier operation.
3)		Four transformers shall be rated at 7500 volt (input), 2288 volt (output), 11.5 MVA.   These shall have appropriate phase shifting for 24 pulse rectifier operation.
4)      Four transformers will be connected via cable and four will be connected via circular aluminum bus.
5)		The lower power rated transformers will have no load manually selectable taps at 100%, 90% and 80 %.  These will be full current taps. 
4)       Delivery of the transformers shall be within 10 months after receipt of order.

This Request for Proposals (RFP)will be a Best Value with trade-offs procurement based upon price and other factors.

<DESC>The current pre-solicitation notice and any resulting procurement actions resulting from it for the TIER II Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) System Concept Demonstration, synopsized on 05 August 2005, are hereby cancelled. Documents associated with the TIER II UAV acquisition strategy and resulting procurement considered to be source selection sensitive were made available outside the government.  It has been determined by the Contracting Officer that the release of this information, in its current form, could have a detrimental impact on conducting a fair, full and open competition for the stated requirements. While the requirements currently remain, all associated acquisition strategy documents will be reviewed; updated/revised and the requirement is anticipated to be re-solicited as a new UAV procurement in the future. Currently, no timetable is scheduled for the review of current documentation and the re-solicitation of Marine Corps UAV requirements.  To ensure a leve! l playing field for any future TIER II UAV procurement, the documents will be made available to interested parties from 12 September 2005 to 16 September 2005 at the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, 3255 Meyers Avenue, Quantico, VA 22134. Points of contact for an appointment to review the aforementioned documents are Ms Sandra K. Hughes at (703) 784-1124.

<CONTACT>Judy Bowers Program Analyst 2023661913     judy.bowers@dot.gov;
<DESC>The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking information from firms that have the capability to perform accounting services to MARAD, including: Development and maintenance of interface capability between MARAD's financial sub-systems and main accounting systems,  Advise and assist in preparing audited financial statement in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) requirements on Form & Contents, Federal Accounting Standard Advisory Board (FASAB) and General Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP), Provide professional accounting staff members to assist the office to carry out accounting functions, and  Defend MARAD's financial statement in order to receive an unqualified opinion from agencies' Office of Inspector General (OIG) or certified public auditors (CPAs).   Knowledge of the FREEBALANCE fund control system MARAD-wide (headquarters, regions and field offices) and understand the interface capability among FREEBALANCE obligation & payment, payroll labor distribution system, credit card system and MARAD's main accounting system DAFIS and DELPHI, and Electronic Invoicing system. Provide guidance and direction on Oracle.   Assist USDOT Office of the Secretary of Transportation  (OST) and Oracle in the development of a Federal Project Module for the future to handle federal reimbursable accounting and credit reform accounting module being developed by OST. Assist MARAD in using the labor distribution system in CASTLE to interface to DELPHI in FY 2006, and Assist MARAD to develop the mechanism in implementing DOT-wide Managerial Cost Accounting  in FY 2006. Provide professional accounting staff members to assist the office when carrying out accounting functions during the transition period of outsourcing accounting data entry functions to DOT Enterprise Service Center in Oklahoma (e.g., accounting operations function on accounts payable, Intra-governmental Payment and Collection - IPAC, etc.).  MARAD's needs for Continuing Enhancement on Financial  Management MARAD's Office of Accounting continues confronting a tremendous pressure & challenges from the OMB, Treasury and DOT, Office of Secretary, and requires assistance in the following areas: 1.	The requirements for agencies to achieve a "GREEN" status under the President's Management Agenda on financial management have imposed agencies to take aggressive actions to develop a managerial cost accounting system for measuring and evaluating financial and program performance. 2.	Furthermore, the OMB requires agencies government-wide to submit an annual audited financial statement to the OMB no later than November 15 of each year.  Therefore, DOT/MARAD has only 46 days (from October 1 to November 15) to: prepare to work with the OIG for resolving audit issues; and, to work with the OST to submit an audited consolidated DOT fiscal year financial statement to the OMB.  In conjunction with MARAD, develop strategies, mechanism and various supporting reconciliation and reports to facilitate and defend the preparation of MARAD's fiscal year audited financial statement according to the OST and the OIG's tight time frame.  3.	DOT, under government-wide initiative, is in the process of converting current DOT payroll system to the Department of Interior's (DOI's) payroll system.  MARAD completed Phase I of the conversion and will implement Phase II of the conversion during FY 2006 (i.e., conversion of the labor distribution system).  Implementation of Phase II is critical to DOT's meeting "Green" status of the President's Management Agenda.  For FY2006, OST has imposed a tighter timeframe for OAs to complete Phase II than in previous years.     4.	OST, B-30 (Office of Financial Management) and OAs are currently in the process of testing the development of an on-demand Financial Statement Solution (FSS) for preparing and supporting monthly financial statement.   The timely testing and implementation of FSS is very critical to convince and meet the OIG's audit requirements. 5.	One of the OIG's finding on DOT's weakness in the reconciliation and confirmation for eliminating the duplicated counting of "Intra-Departmental" and "Intra-Governmental" financial activities (e.g., revenue, expense, accounts payable and accounts receivable within Federal government should be eliminated).  This is one  the weakness that prevents DOT from achieving "Green" status of the President's Management Agenda.  MARAD has approximately 1,000 open intra-governmental agreements (including proving and receiving services).      6.	Under OST's initiative and plan, MARAD is required to sunset the current internal fund control system (FREEBALANCE) by the end of FY 2006 and implement the DELPHI's Budget Execution Module.  The sunset of FREEBALANCE will interrupt and impact the interface between EIS and DELPHI.  The implementation of Budget Execution Module fund control system will require efforts and knowledge for the conversion. 7.	Under DOT's initiatives, MARAD is required to implement IMAGING system for invoices.  This implementation will require restructuring of work flow and work force and will require research and study of the interface between IMAGE and DELPHI. 8.	Under DOT's initiative, continue to provide resources and expertise during the interim period for transferring accounting data entry function to DOT's Enterprise Services Center in Oklahoma City.   9.	Continue to provide training for new processes and new mechanisms where needed.  Interested firms are requested to provide the following information in response to this sources sought: 1.	A rough order of magnitude of cost estimate, labor-hour rates, and a capabilities statement. 2.	If on the GSA Schedule, provide contract number(s). 3.	Provide Socio-economic status. This request for information is not a request for proposals/quotes and will not result in a solicitation leading to a contract.  MARAD will not be responsible for any costs associated with information provided in response to this RFI.  Respondents are reminded to mark business sensitive information appropriately. Anticipated Period of Performance:  Five Years (one base year and 4 option years)

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302,the U.S. Census Bureau intends to issue a sole source follow-on contract to SeekData, Inc. 2715 Michigan Avenue, Kissimmee, FL 34744-1551 for the continued production of Puerto Rico Master Address file updates. 
The contractor shall provide address file deliveries to the Geography Division in support of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS).  The file deliveries must contain records representing newly constructed residential units (single-family housing, individual apts., townhouses etc.).  The address information provided with a record must conform to one of the following categories:

·	Posted house number and street name address used for mail delivery or an acceptable variations.  
·	Posted E-911 address and a mailing address (Rural Route, Highway Contract, and PO Box)
·	Posted E-911 address 
·	Rural Route and Highway Contract address, street name, and lat/long. GPS structure coordinates.
·	Name and GPS structure coordinates, but only in new residential developments with street networks that geographically isolate the developments from any surrounding residences.

All records must be geocoded to Census Bureau defined blocks. They must be standardized and parsed and each address must have a pre-defined mailing algorithm code.  Each scheduled delivery will include two files, each with the same universe of records, but in different file layouts.  One layout is for a MAF Update File and the other is for a MAF Work File.  Each address record must possess a unique identifier assign by the contractor.  For any given delivery, the identifiers must be included in both files and never repeated in subsequent deliveries. 

Four file deliveries are due on six-month intervals with the first and third deliveries due on the 15th of December in 2005 and 2006, respectively.  The second and fourth deliveries are due on the 15th of June in 2006 and 2007, respectively.  The address records must not duplicate any records previously delivered to the U.S. Census Bureau.  The Census Bureau’s expectation for the number of new address records is approximately 13,000 addresses in the first delivery and 6,500 addresses in each of the remaining three deliveries. 

During the term of the contract the contractor may be required to perform off-site processing of address records classified as Title 13 Census Confidential Data.    SeekData’s off-site facility currently meets all requirements necessary for full accreditation for a Census IT system.  
It is USCB belief that SeekData's previous experience and  exisiting infrastructure would mitigate risk of substaintial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements for file deliveries. 

Any responses to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.

In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau's needs.  The contractor should demonstrate its ability to bring their physical site and computing environment into Title 13 compliance at the time off-site processing is required   Detailed capabilities must be received at the U.S. Census Bureau by COB, September 9, 2005.     They will be provided via email to Natalie Y. Ellis (Contract Support) at natalie.y.ellis@census.gov    Ms Natalie Y. Ellis may also be contacted at 301/763-9045. 

This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.     No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.     No contract will be awarded on the basis of information received in response to this notice, but the information will be used to determine if acomparable sources are available.     If no affirmative written response is received by COB September 9, 2005, a contract may be issued to SeekData, Inc without further notice.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS) Project Office (G-AIS). This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the USCG to acquire any products or services.  The USCG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested.  Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary.  The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.  In compliance with the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) 2002, emerging maritime security requirements, and the need to improve vessel traffic services (VTS) and navigational safety, the USCG is developing an NAIS that will support Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) over the Nation’s navigable waters and adjacent sea areas.  MDA is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States.  AIS is an international protocol which adheres to the International Telecommunications Union Sector for Radiocommunications (ITU-R) Recommendation M.1371-1 standard for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore, and shore-to-ship communication of information, including vessel identity, position, speed, course, destination and other data of critical interest for navigation safety and maritime security.  AIS equipment is required domestically and internationally aboard many commercial vessels.  The information provided by NAIS will support most of the nation’s maritime interests, including the safety of vessels and waterways through collision avoidance and traffic management, safeguarding the nation through detection, identification, and classification of vessels from within national waters to thousands of miles offshore.  NAIS will complement other surveillance and intelligence systems that aid the essential process of identifying vessels requiring further investigation and action.  NAIS information will be displayed in command and control (C2) systems that receive USCG national maritime Common Operational Picture (COP) feeds, along with data and intelligence correlated as appropriate, with data from other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and federal agency sources.  NAIS information will also be available to federal, state, and local port partners in support of security and safety operations.   NAIS will consist of an integrated system of AIS equipment (e.g., receivers, transmitters, antennas, etc.), data storage, processing, and networking infrastructure.  The intention of the NAIS Project is to use existing infrastructure and interoperate with other systems, federal agencies, and entities, as much as possible.  External systems will be included in the context of NAIS services, e.g., command and control (C2) systems, law enforcement databases, vessel traffic services (VTS), and notice of arrival databases, for the purpose of sharing infrastructure, quickly implementing capabilities, and improving performance.  NAIS has the capability of sending and receiving AIS messages, via a Very High Frequency (VHF) Data Link (VDL), to and from AIS equipped vessels, Aids to Navigation (ATON), and Search and Rescue (SAR) aircraft.  NAIS may leverage several types of platforms to support AIS receive and transmit infrastructure (e.g., towers) or receive-only infrastructure (e.g., aircraft).  AIS message data shall be transported over a wide area network (WAN) utilizing diverse, remote site connectivity (e.g., leased T-1 circuits, microwave, fiber optics).  NAIS shall process (e.g., validate, filter) and store AIS-provided vessel track and static data.  External systems shall be enhanced to provide data processing functions (e.g., vessel tracking correlation, intelligence processing, and anomaly detection), user interfaces, and indirect access for some NAIS users (e.g., USCG Deepwater assets, public and port partners).  All solutions shall be certified and accredited for compliance with all U.S. Federal, DHS, and USCG information assurance policies.  Preliminary high-level functional requirements are outlined as follows.  RECEIVE/TRANSMIT:  NAIS shall provide the capability to receive and transmit AIS messages via the VDL to and from all AIS equipped vessels within ports, navigable waters, and coastal areas out to 24 nm.  The system shall also be able to receive some AIS messages out to 2000 nm of the baseline from which U.S. territorial waters are measured.  Receive and transmit capabilities shall operate on all AIS channels as defined in ITU-R M.1371-1.  The AIS network shall consist of AIS reception and transmission sites; these sites may be completely separate or combined.  Monitoring and management of message traffic, frequency usage and interference throughout the area of required coverage shall be provided.  Methods of detecting and locating an interferer with AIS messaging and frequencies; and mitigating spoofing and jamming will be incorporated.   NETWORK:  The network shall route and transport data between AIS base stations, user interfaces, data processing capabilities, and external users.  A plan for Spectrum authorization/management shall be provided (See NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management). INTEROPERABILITY: NAIS shall leverage USCG enterprise architecture components to provide interoperability among USCG and external entities’ networks, databases, and systems.  Users may access AIS-related capabilities via external systems.  DATA PROCESSING:  NAIS shall store, retrieve, archive, and recover vessel data received, created, modified, and transmitted.  NAIS may leverage an existing data warehouse.  NAIS shall automatically verify and validate AIS data (e.g., position reports) through comparison with other AIS received information (e.g. time difference of arrival) and with other available independent sensors and data sources.  USER INTERFACES:  NAIS shall provide user interfaces (to the extent possible incorporated with or as modules of existing and planned command and control, analysis and information retrieval systems) for data analysis, system administration, and AIS message management.  The data analysis user interface shall include a means for users to query historical data via the archive.  Existing systems shall support vessel identification & tracking, vessel inspection & target selection, vessel traffic management, vessel movement analysis, maritime incident investigations, ATON and SAR.  ADMINISTRATION: NAIS shall provide network administration, system diagnostics, and physical status monitoring and alarm capabilities.  Each installation shall monitor its own performance and condition.  System monitoring capabilities shall not interfere with or degrade normal system functions.  NAIS may leverage existing administration capabilities and facilities (e.g., network operations center).  Software and network administration shall include the capability to monitor the health of the centralized software and network that is receiving and processing the data transmitted from remote sites/platforms as well as the capability to monitor system security in order to preserve the integrity of the AIS data received (current and historical). The USCG invites industry to respond with information regarding existing and planned capabilities for technical solutions, components, and implementation strategies similar to requirements being considered and described in this RFI.  The USCG is also interested in the technical feasibility and state of the market for achieving such requirements. The Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI. Due to a variety of limitations, the USCG does not plan to entertain questions related to the substance of this RFI. Industry days, pre-solicitation, and/or pre-proposal conferences may be held, pending the level of interest. Industry is advised that Government support contractors will review non-proprietary information.  Responses to this RFI can be submitted no later than July 28, 2005 to Ms. Eleni Jernell (G-ACS-5D) via email at ejernell@comdt.uscg.mil or via mail at U.S. Coast Guard, 1900 Half Street SW, Washington, D.C., 20024, Attn: Ms. Eleni Jernell (G-ACS-5D).

The successful contractor should first seek coverage under the SAFETY Act through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Information about the application process may be obtained from the DHS website, www.safetyact.gov. The Secure Flight/Registered Traveler Program is currently working with DHS to streamline the application process for certain Secure Flight/Registered Traveler Program contracts.

<SOLNBR>W15P7T-05-I2WD-011
<RESPDATE>092305
<ARCHDATE>11222005
<CONTACT>Louise Huntley, 732-427-7101
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to request white papers for Spiral I of the Sensor Integrated Fusion Technology (SIFT), Army Technology Objective (ATO) Program.  Responses to this RFI will be reviewed by the Government and may result in an invita tion to submit proposals against the BAA for a 2QFY06 Spiral I award.  Award is not guaranteed and the Government does not intend to pay for information received.   The goal of SIFT is to develop technology to improve the utility of sensor system output to human operators.  SIFT is a four-year program which will demonstrate enhanced Brigade-level situational awareness by developing a flexible, semi-autonomous, multi-s ensor fusion and sensor management capability aboard an air (or ground) platform.  The system will provide the Warfighter with near real-time situational awareness (SA) as well as support rapid target development.  Specific program objectives include: (1) enhanced situational awareness, (2) high confidence (human derived & facilitated through cross-cueing) object ID, (3) flexible mission-oriented tailoring, (4) enhanced target prosecution rate, (5) robust extended track and hold capability, (6) reduced op erator workload, and (7) reduced communication bandwidth.   The SIFT program is comprised of three Spirals, the first of which is a two year effort to develop, integrate and flight test a closed-loop system to demonstrate incremental progress in achieving the above objectives.  During this Spiral the Government pla ns to team with a single industry partner.  The Government will provide a general architecture and preliminary ICDs to components which are external to the core fusion processes, such as sensor interface/selection, data-link, Man-Machine Interface, GPS ser vices, data dissemination, sensor-platform integration, and over-arching system control (initialization, tasking and status).  The Industry partner will provide a baseline collection of fusion services to fit within this framework.  Industry and the Govern ment are intended to work collaboratively to develop a lab-prototype (hosted in the Government SIL) within ten months, a fully functional lab system within 16 months, and an airborne configuration hosted within 19 months.  The Government expects an award o f ~$5M for this effort.   The Government is requesting information on approaches to the fusion complement (a collection of fusion services) that are realistically achievable within the approximate bounds of the cost and schedule constraints discussed above.  Fusion services (within  this document) shall refer to any process that enhances the information derived from available data sources; from initial sensor exploitation through dynamic sensor & route planning.  For the purposes of this RFI, fusion can occur at the pixel, feature, o bject, or report level.   Only those organizations or industry teams (encouraged) capable of providing the full complement of the objective capabilities should respond.   The objectives of the fusion complement, not listed in prioritized manner, are as follows: (1) Implement the fusion constructs and services necessary to support near-real-time autonomous wide-area detection and dynamic cross-cueing of high-fidelity narrow field-of-view (NFOV) assets to optimize the coverage, fidelity and accuracy of information available to the analyst.  The intent of cueing is generally, but not exclusively, to obtain ID-quality imagery for the analyst.   (2) Provide a mission-oriented and mission-tailorable framework such that an operators mission need(s), rather than specific collection tasks, form the basis for SIFT operation.  At a minimum the desired Spiral I solution should provide the ability to, in  low-density environments: Autonomously Detect (wide-area) and cue (NFOV) on moving vehicular threats; Autonomously Detect (wide-area) and cue (NFOV) on stationary vehicular threats; Engage operator-identified vehicular threats under persistent track for a t least  twelve minutes.   (3) Fusion Services should accept as inputs Raw data from co-located sensors such as: SIGINT, tactical SAR/GMTI, RF Tags and commercial EO/IR systems; external report-level feeds such as from counter-mortar radars; and IPB/IPE products such as land-cover  and elevation data.  Raw data refers to complex imagery, video, lines-of-bearing, and unfiltered MTI data streams.   (4) Fusion services should be implemented in such a manner that objects most likely to represent threats are prosecuted first to avoid wasting sensor/processing resources on non-threat-like objects.  The basis for object prioritization includes, but is  not limited to, sensor-derived object-features, object-level classifications and/or context within the battlespace.  Threat-like, for Spiral 1, will be defined as a vehicle of various types.   (5) Fusion services should provide temporally and spatially correlated and prioritized data products to a GFE database from which products can be disseminated.  Products include single and multi INT tracks/reports.   (6) Fusion services should generate and optimize collection plans (route and sensor scheduling) and dynamically update them throughout the mission as appropriate.  Optimization should consider sensor performance, sensor constraints, fusion performance, env ironmental limitations (shadowing, weather, etc.) and mission objectives.  Sensor tasks should be autonomously generated by the fusion services and executed by Government-provided sensor control services.  Platform routes should be generated by the fusion services, but approved/executed by the platform operator.   (7) All services and constructs are desired to be sufficiently flexible and scalable to accommodate new missions, new target sets, new sensors/modes (of the same general types indicated above) and alternative fusion services.  All services must be well def ined and self-contained.   (8) To increase modularity, portability, ease of evaluation and ease of integration throughout the evolution of this program, all inter-service (e.g. SIFT fusion services) communications should use middleware such as CORBA, JXTA or RMI, and a GFE database backbone for storage of all major inter-service data products such as fused/un-fused reports and tracks.  Linux is the preferred operating environment.  The collection of fusion services should be host-able on a compute platform containing no more than ten  CPUs.  It is preferred that Fusion services be compute-platform independent.   Responses to this RFI should be no more than 25 single sided pages of size 10 or 12 font.  The responses should describe the approach within the service-oriented architectural and programmatic constraints and objectives outlined above.   Responses are to be received by 10:00 EST, 23 SEP 2005.  All information must be in writing or via e-mail.  You may forward responses to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-BA (Mr. Fedorow) or the followin g e-mail address: Vincent.Fedorow@us.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  If you choose to submit proprietary information, mark it accordingly.  Classified information will be accepted by mail only, but please mark it accordingly and send  it via proper channels.  Classified information can be sent to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: Security Office.  The inner wrapping shall be addressed to: ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-BA (Mr. Fedorow). Questions regarding this information request are encouraged and can be directed to Mr. Fedorow VIA EMAIL ONLY.

More than three instances during a fiscal year of re-interview necessity will cancel this contract with the Contractor and the contract will be re-let for bids.  If at any time a court reporter provided is not deemed capable to perform the service by the Chair of the proceeding, the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System has the right to stop proceedings, notify the Contractor that the reporter assigned is not performing as needed, and request a replacement court reporter at no additional cost.

The contracting officer for this requirement is Christopher Burroughs chris.burroughs@va.gov. STATEMENT OF WORK General Information This Contract is to provide 1) subject indexing of materials related to the adjudication of claims; 2) regulatory history and Citator tracing by subject matter for portions of Title 38 CFR through various earlier VA regulations and documents; 3) attachment verification and quality check on all Board of Veterans’ Appeals (BVA) decisions, including verifying and associating all Vacated, Corrected and Reconsidered decisions with the earlier version, scanning unavailable decisions, preparing an electronic file of unavailable decisions, transmitting the electronic file, and providing an edit list of problems for correction by BVA; 4) maintain Infobases in a format that can be uploaded into Folio version 3.1; 5) Consulting and Programming support to be defined by task orders; and 6) secure storage of data in electronic and microform formats. The BVA Research Center contains a large archive of current and historical administrative materials.  These materials are not adequately retrieved by the usual bibliographic identification.  Basically it is of little use to know that there are 63 binders of VA forms when you need to obtain only one specific form.  VADEX allows you to identify and locate such specific record information. Invoices will be submitted quarterly and will be paid in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.   Progress meetings may be held, usually quarterly.  Efforts will be made to resolve all matters by e-mail or phone before having a meeting. Contractor is not expected to work in the BVA facility but access is provided when necessary to complete the work. Please identify the skills of key personnel and include the percentage of time those key personnel will be available for this Contract. Definitions BVA – Board of Veterans’ Appeals CO – Contracting Officer COR – Contracting Officer’s Representative VA – Department of Veterans Affairs VACOLS – Veterans Appeals Control and Locator System Government Furnished Property and Services The Government will provide containers suitable for the transportation of documents and computer disks or tapes.  The Government will provide access to VACOLS, Computer Assisted Legal Research, and appropriate research facilities.  VACOLS access will be on the VA Virtual Private Network.   Contractor Furnished Property and Services Contractor will provide all computers and related equipment to access the databases provided and to prepare the required files.  Contractor will provide pickup and delivery of physical materials.  Contractor will provide e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers.  Contractor will provide Broadband Access to the Internet.  Contactor personnel who have access to the VA computer systems will be required to complete annual Cyber Security training, which will take approximately one hour.  Contractor personnel who have access to decisions in any format must complete annual Privacy Awareness training, which will take approximately one hour.  Training will be available online, by videotape or at the BVA offices, as is most convenient to the Contractor personnel.  Contractor personnel must provide signed certification of completion to the CO during each year of the contract. Contractor must properly dispose of unredacted documents, using shredder or other document destruction device. Contractor will provide personnel capable of indexing using a controlled vocabulary in English; maintaining a controlled vocabulary in English; researching and documenting the history of a specific subject regulated by the VA in English; Contractor personnel who have access to VA computer systems will be the subject of a background investigation and must receive a favorable adjudication from the VA Office of Security and Law Enforcement prior to contract performance.  The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for their connectivity to the VA computer network and ensure that any connected computer equipment meets VA standards relating to security. The BVA reserves the right to make additional copies, or portions thereof, as it deems necessary and the Contractor shall have no claim for additional copies.  Specific Tasks Item 1 – Indexing (VADEX):  Provide infobase and print index to materials relevant to BVA adjudication; vocabulary control (specific subject matter); quarterly electronic updates; three copies of annual print edition of the controlled vocabulary, including all references, reciprocals, and logical categories; advance sheets showing the indexing completed for each document; sequentially numbered documents which are determined by the Research Center staff to be not relevant to adjudication are recorded in an Adjunct file to assure that all documents have been reviewed; quarterly listing of missing numbers for each series of sequentially numbered documents.  Expired items are deleted from the database.  Superseded items are indexed under their current reference. Item 2 – Citator (Regulatory History):  Provide quarterly electronic updates to infobase, microfiche and three copies of annual print Citator.  A special Project under Item 5 may involving providing a searchable electronic file hotlinked to image file, text file or website. . Also, as a special project under Item 5, temporarily maintain a complete paper file of any recreated regulatory history to be used to create an electronic legislative history.  Annual print Citator provides a shelf list for the microfiche regulatory histories. When preparing a regulatory history, it is preferred to use the image of the original document rather than a retyped or computer generated copy.  However, if the image of the original document is unavailable or not of a quality which will reproduce effectively, a retyped or computer generated copy may be substituted. Microfiche is currently created using updatable fiche jackets.  This is a continuous editing process sometimes resulting in the total revision of a recently completed history.  The current contractor maintains the updatable fiche jackets.  Any proposal should describe how the microfiche will be updated and how the masters will be maintained. The Research Center staff may develop some regulatory histories.  Those regulatory histories will be provided to Contractor for editing.  Since the specific question posted to the Research Center will have particular dates involved, it may be necessary for the Contractor to complete the tracing. Regulations are identified for tracing by three separate mechanisms:  (1) when a regulation is amended; (2) when the Research Center staff identifies a regulation as requiring an update; and (3) when there is an anticipated need for an untraced section to be traced.  The majority of regulations are identified as a result of an amendment made in the Federal Register. Workload for Item 2 is expected to be high due to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA’s) Regulation Rewrite project.   Item 3 – Attachment Verification:  Work includes providing an error list, electronic files for uploading, machine-readable decisions for archiving, and weekly pickup and delivery of physical documents in paper or electronic format.  Weekly turn around of materials is required, with no more than three deliveries during the year being delayed.  The purpose of this item is to have a more accurate database of BVA decisions. The contractor will be provided with a paper copy of the dispatched decision and access to the archived decision in VACOLS.  The contractor will perform an integrity check for purposes of verifying that the paper decision matches both the archived decision and the VACOLS record in the following respects: 1.	in text,  2.	the listed Regional Office, 3.	the listed service dates and file numbers, and 4.	the listed representation, if any. The decision will be reviewed for internal errors such as whether “Conclusions of Law” section matches the “Issue”, “Introduction,” and “Findings of Fact” sections of decisions.  The decision also will be reviewed to determine whether any Personal Identifiers, as defined by the Privacy Act, are included.   The contractor will generate a weekly error report listing problems found that BVA personnel will then use to make corrections to the archived decisions When a BVA decision must be scanned by the contractor for purposes of attaching to VACOLS, certain edit checks are run against the scanned text, prior to transmitting it.  The scanned decisions are batched and transferred electronically in a flat file format.  Scanned decisions will be reviewed for Personal Identifiers, which will be redacted.   Any discrepancies are to be referred to BVA for resolution. Vacated, Reconsidered and Corrected Decisions constitute approximately 2 percent of decisions issued by the BVA.  These items are associated with the earlier decision in the archive.  This allows users of the archive to be aware of the later decision when reviewing the earlier one.   Workload varies due to priorities and changes in the law.  During the first 11 months of calendar 2004, 30,000 decisions were reviewed.  Approximately 2 percent required scanning or other special processing.  The Workload for Item 3 depends upon the number of decisions issued by the BVA.  The following chart shows the number of Appeals Decided for each of the last five years, as well as projections for the next two years.   Fiscal Year		FY2000	FY2001	FY2002	FY2003	FY2004	FY2005	  FY2006 Appeals Decided		  34,038	  31,557    17,231	  31,397    38,371   33,126*    32,224* 	*Projected Item 4 – Maintain Infobases for Use in Folio 3.1 Format:  Infobases of Chairman’s Memorandums, GC Precedential Opinions, CAVC Precedent Decisions, Research Center Shelflist, and Veteran’s Benefit Law Index.  Datafiles must be in a format which can be imported into Folio 3.1.  Datafiles are to be updated quarterly, unless there have been no changes to a particular database in the last quarter.  The materials are provided by e-mail or in the weekly pick-up.  The databases are currently maintained in Access. Item 5  – Consulting and Programming Support – Task Orders: Task Orders will be issued for special projects.  Examples of projects that might be completed are migrating a database to new software, creating an electronic regulatory history using the master data, or training BVA Staff in the use of the products. Item 6 – Secure Data Storage for Data and Products:  Materials will be stored on CD or microform, as appropriate.  The specific items involved include VADEX and CITATOR Archive Files, BVA Vocabulary Master Files, Citator microfiche master updatable fiche jackets, master microfiche of Research Center subject files, and Research Center shelflist.  Regulatory history materials available in print that may be required for scanning and electronic database conversion will be retained until the work is completed, or for no more than 9 months.   Applicable Publications and Forms Technical Exhibits Data Requirements The computer environment for this work is Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP operating systems workstations, along with Oracle 8i database and SQL*Net software for VACOLS tracking system.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), Microbial Food Safety (MFS), intends to negotiate solely with Growth Curves USA, in Piscataway, NJ to purchase a Bioscreen C MBR, which includes software and warranty support.  Bioscreen C MBR is a unique, high?capacity system for automation of microbiology designed to speed up microbiology work.  It is a computer-controlled shaker/incubator/reader/analyzer equipped with 8 filters from 405 nm to 600 nm, including a wide-band filter.  The length of test performed can be set from a single measurement to one year.  The incubator system has a working range from 1 to 60 degrees C. in steps of 0.1 degree, which maintains accuracy within 0.1 degree of set temperature for a month or more.  EZExperiment software (provided with the system) presents OD values in matrix form, which can be easily used to draw growth curves using Microsoft Excel.  These experiments involve measuring the multiple effects of physical and environmental conditions on the bacterial behavior.  Specifically, we will measure the growth promoting/inhibiting effects of NaC1, pH and spoilage flora.  In order to accomplish these tasks, we require an instrument that will permit multi-well analyses.  Companies with the demonstrated capabilities of providing this instrument must submit a descriptive statement, including descriptive literature, specifically addressing the equipment=s component=s and availability.  The statement and literature must be submitted to the Contracting Office Address within 10 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.

The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between offerss that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional co
.0s that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

1.0 Background 

1.1 National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is an independent Federal agency that helps preserve our nation's history by overseeing the management of all Federal records.  NARA intends to implement an enterprise VTC capability that will enable any NARA employee, contractor, or researcher to have face-to-face meetings with colleagues by offering a bridging service using industry standard technology for interoperability, point-to-point and multi-point VTC requirements while being in different locations. Two sites (point-to-point) or multiple sites (multi-point) can participate in a conference.


1.2 NARA VTC Requirements
NARA's VTC requirements are increasing significantly and the technology landscape is rapidly changing.  NARA seeks to establish a video conferencing capability that will provide flexibility, reliability and a robust architecture for virtually any meeting room, classroom, or medium group environment. NARA seeks to use this VTC capability to reach teachers and students in classrooms across the nation and around the world with a wide variety of programs. These educational enrichment programs will provide audiences with the opportunity to learn more about the presidency and a broad range of other topics about the American experience.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Offerors are required to use the On-Line RFQ system to submit their quote.  The On-line RFQ system is linked above or it may be accessed at	   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=	   .  The information required by FAR Subpart 12.6 is included in the on-line RFQ. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. This acquisition is for brand name only, pursuant to FAR 11.105, for the acquisition of a particular brand name, product, or feature that is essential to the Government's requirements. Maximum competition is impractical for the following reasons:   1.	The items are components to be inserted on custom printed circuit boards used in the Space Shuttle Main Engine Controller (SSMEC) Hardware Simulation Laboratory (HSL). The new boards must match existing printed circuit boards. The functionality required is component pin function and physical form factor. Interface of another manufacturer's components to provide this functionality isn’t technically feasible within the cost and schedule constraints of the project because the existing circuit boards would have to be modified to interface with another manufacturer’s components. Market research performed through internet searches indicates that no other manufacturers parts fit the pin function and physical form necessary to be installed on this circuit board. 2.	Marshall Space Flight Center has a substantial investment in the design of this circuit board, prior builds of this board, and in the tools necessary to design, build and program boards with Altera FPGA parts, which is estimated to be at least $150,000. Questions regarding this acquisition must be submitted in writing (e-mail is preferred) no later than September 8, 2005.  It is the quoter's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of amendments (if any).

PLEASE CONTACT KEITH BLEVINS AT (301) 394-1088, OR EMAIL kblevins@arl.army.mil FOR AN ELECTRONIC OR FAXED COPY OF THE SPECIFICATIONS (COPIES OF THE SPECIFICAT IONS WILL NOT BE MAILED). Specifications C.1.0	Overview: One of the critical areas in utilizing power electronics is the packaging that supports these devices and allows them to operate in their intended environments.  This packaging can take many arbitrary forms depending on the electronic devices and systems b eing developed, and the environments can vary and include harsh temperatures and chemical environments.  In a Research and Development environment, these packages can go through many design cycles in an effort to determine a best fit solution.  Using typic al machining and fabrication methods for such low quantity orders can quickly become cost prohibitive, and turn around time often delays the development process.  To achieve better packaging capability, we will require a fabrication system that can quickly  produce environmentally robust parts of arbitrary, yet precise, shape.  For many years now the rapid prototyping industry has been advancing the field of direct fabrication of mechanical parts, and recently the ability to work with high-performance engine ering plastics in lower cost fabrication systems has been developed.  Such a system will allow the design engineers to quickly and reliably produce parts from standard computer design files that will be functional in test environments. C.2.0	Requirements and Specifications: C.2.1.	The contractor shall provide a 3D rapid prototyping system that meets the following requirements: C.2.1.1.	Capable of taking as input (either directly of through use of included conversion software) a standard STL computer file containing the CAD design of the part to be built. C.2.1.2.	Part build volume of 15,600 cubic cm or larger, with no dimension smaller than 25cm. C.2.1.3.	Part layer thicknesses of less than 0.010 inches (0.254mm) C.2.1.4.	Lateral dimension nominal accuracy of less than 0.010 inches (0.254mm) C.2.1.5.	Capable of producing parts with an environmentally robust material meeting the following criteria: C.2.1.5.1.	Heat deflection temperature greater than 150 degrees Celsius (302 degrees Fahrenheit) C.2.1.6.	No chemical breakdown when immersed in water, oil, or antifreeze at elevated temperatures (greater than 95°C). C.2.1.7.	System must also have the ability to work with other less expensive fabrication materials (in addition to the aforementi oned robust material). C.2.1.8.	System shall allow a trained user to interchange materials C.2.1.9.	System shall include any support equipment needed for part finishing or cleaning (not including personal computers, but system need for personal computer of clearly stated). C.2.2.

Security Requirements for Contractor Personnel: All unescorted Contractor personnel utilized under this award shall submit to a Government background investigation prior to performing work on-site at any CSOSA facility.  The intent and purpose of this investigation is to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful work completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior.  Contractor employees must be U.S. citizens, or be lawfully permitted to reside in the United States and possess a valid work permit.  Background Investigations: The Contractor shall ensure that a Contractor employee does not begin work until the appropriate background checks are conducted and approved by the CSOSA Office of Security. When a preliminary background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval to the Office of Procurement, who in turn will notify the Contractor.  Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility. Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual. When an individual is selected for contractual employment, the Contractor shall have the individual complete a background investigation package consisting of the items identified below.  The individual is generally provided 10 days to complete and return the forms to the Contracting Officer, or authorized representative.  The following forms will be provided and must be completed:  (1) CSOSA-SEC-0008, Agency Credit Release Form, (2) FD 258, FBI Fingerprint Card, (3) Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, (4) Contractor’s Preliminary Background Check Form.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor, in order to ensure complete coverage for the services specified herein, to maintain an adequate staff of individuals meeting all of the requirements of this contract.  To that end, the Contractor should submit the names of additional individuals, so that the requisite preliminary background checks can be conducted. CSOSA has the right to request any additional information necessary in order to adjudicate the completed background investigation.  If a Contractor employee fails to provide any of the above information, or to cooperate with CSOSA Office of Security, the individual will be removed immediately.  Contractor’s Responsibility: (1) The Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor employee commences performance prior to completion of the background investigation,  unless the Office of Security grants approval.  (2) Any individual who has been temporarily removed or resigned may be required to undergo another background investigation before resuming any position.  At the discretion of the COTR, the Contractor shall forward the required forms for a reinvestigation to the COTR.  Prior to forwarding the forms, the Contractor is responsible for reviewing the forms for completeness. The forms should be forwarded with a cover letter indicating that the forms are for reinvestigation of a current Contractor employee.  Government’s Responsibility: (1) The Government will conduct a background investigation on all individuals involved in the contract. Derogatory information developed from this investigation may be considered justification to reject the applicant.  The Government also reserves the right to reinvestigate all Contractor personnel working on this contract for any reason.  (2) Upon completion of the background investigation, the Office of Security will review the results to determine suitability for the individual. Primary concern in the review process is to decide if the individual's presence in Agency facilities poses a potential risk to CSOSA, the Government, or the general public.

<DESC>Solicitation Number:HSCEAM-05-R-00025 	Attachment 4
Amendment:002
This solicitation is amended as follows: 
1.  The Government confirms that this Job Task Analysis (JTA) does include both the technical preparation of a JTA as well as the development and justification of medical standards.  Any requirement for continued support of the screening system based on the JTA shall be handled separately from this procurement.  
Please delete the following paragraph from the SOW Attachment 1 Final Report:

“The consultants must be available, upon written notification to provide sworn testimony in administrative or legal proceedings with regard to the development and establishment of the JTA and job-related performance based medical and physical qualification requirements. 


2.  Question:  “The Job Task Analysis solicitation refers to the Place of Performance as Reston, VA along with a postal code.  I can find no other reference to requirements for on-site performance for the contract.  Could you clarify?  In other words, will the awarded contractor require all contract personnel to be on site for the duration of the contract, for part of the contract, for only some labor categories, etc.”

Government response:  “The primary place of performance could take place at various locations to include a contractor's worksite as well as various DHS offices per the vendor's technical approach and field office's selected for travel.  Any requirements for Government furnished office-space or equipment should be identified in the Offeror’s proposal.”

3.  Question:  “One additional question pertaining to the solicitation in the subject line. Attachment 1 section 5.0 (page 4 of 9) indicates that the technical approach should include signed non-disclosure statements from contract participants.  Would this be a DHS form or would it be something that the contractor would develop?”

Government response:  The contractor may use the DHS Non-Disclosure Agreement DHS Form 11000-6 (08-04.  Available on line, or contact the CO.


4.    Question:  “In Attachment 1, page 8, 6 lines from the top: what is meant by ‘Describes the level of difficulty in performing each job task’?  Please define difficulty in what sense.”

Government response:  Difficulty in performing a task refers to the time, effort, and assistance needed to achieve an acceptable level of performance proficiency, or to the difficulty of learning the task on the job without formal training.  The contractor should provide an estimate of task performance difficulty based on estimated training time required to achieve a minimum level of proficiency using the following scale:
None = no training is required 
Low = task requires 1 to 3 days to learn 
Moderate = task may be learned in 1 to 2 weeks 
High = task may require up to 1 month or more to learn 
5. Question:  “In Attachment 1, page 8, last bullet “A physical abilities test template for use during the selection process.”  Please define template?

Government response:  This template is like the practical exercise performance requirements or the list of activities that could be used to document the minimum level of proficiency required of an applicant that is necessary to perform the related job task 
 
6.  Question: “In Attachment 2, #4, paragraph 2, is there a specific format for the cost proposal desired?  What type of rationale for the estimated hours is desired?”

Government Response:  The Government does not have a prescribed format for the cost/price proposal.  It should be responsive to the requirements described in Attachment 2 of this solicitation and conform to the Offeror’s technical approach.


7.  Please note that the delivery date for the 1st deliverable has been extended from 90 days after date of award to 120 days after date of award.  The entire period of performance is extended 30 days from 150 to 180 days.


Please note the due date for proposals remains the same as amendment 001, Wednesday September 7, 2005 @ 4pm EST.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<SUBJECT>66--SCANNING PROBE/ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPE WITH HIGH RESOLUTION SCAN HEAD AND NANO-MANIPULATION ABILITY

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR SCANNING PROBE/ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPE WITH HIGH RESOLUTION SCAN HEAD AND NANO-MANIPULATION ABILITY.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received about the subject solicitation, as seen below. Question 1: Tapping Mode is a patented technique developed and trademarked by Veeco.  It was interesting to see it mentioned in the specifications. Answer 1: There are 3 common modes used in Atomic Force Microscopy, they are: contact mode, non contact mode, and tapping mode (also referred to as intermittent contact mode).  These are general terms and supported by most vendors.  The one-word term “Tapping Mode” may indeed be a trademark name by one of the vendors for their implementation.	We are NOT specifying the need for this trademarked implementation and this should not be in the solicitation.  We are specifying that we are purchasing an AFM that supports the 3 common scanning modes used in Atomic Force Microscopy.  The ability to scan using a tapping mode is a requirement. Question 2: Description of Scan Head range is not understandable: "2.Scan head shall have a range along the Z axis of 1.55?m or better."	What are the units?  Answer 2: The font may not have been adjusted or come across correctly in the solicitation.  The unit specified is micrometer. Question 3: In General:  What will this instrument be used for?  What are the research needs of the group? How many people will be using it?.	What materials will they be working with and what will they need? What form of materials characterization is necessary?  Are they mainly interested in imaging or do they wish to do force curve work as well? Answer 3: The initial use is for material studies, device development, and inspection.  This involves primarily topologic imaging. Question 4: Research needs vs. what is being asked for:  Why the request for an STM and what research needs are expected to be filled by this?	(STM in ambient surroundings will not in general obtain atomic resolution, no matter what is promised--one really needs a UHV-STM.)   Answer 4: The initial use is for material studies, device development, and inspection.  This would involve primarily topologic imaging.  Additional optional capabilities, features, or accessories should be listed separately from the base requirement for information only. Question 5: Has the research group considered a combined AFM/Inverted Optical or combined AFM/Confocal for their needs?  Answer 5: Yes.	The solicitation includes the base requirements.  Additional optional capabilities, features, or accessories should be listed separately from the base requirement for information only. Question 6: Why the dimensions of the materials quoted?  20 mm thickness is much thicker than most samples prepared for AFM.    Answer 6: The initial use is for material studies, device development, and inspection.  The solicitation includes the base requirements.  The minimal sample envelope specified can be met or exceeded by multiple vendors. Question 7: How will the biomaterials aspect be addressed?  As the system is described, there is no mention of working in fluid, temperature control, or environmental control.  Are any of these needed?   Answer 7: No.  Biosamples are not the intended use of the equipment.  The initial use is for material studies, device development, and inspections. Question 8: We have discovered that for many materials, there is no need for an automated approach.  We have designed both "hard approach" techniques and "soft approach" techniques which allow imaging without crashing the tip.  Why the requirement for an automated approach?  Answer 8: The solicitation requirement is for automatic cantilever head alignment.  However, many vendors typically provide an automated approach capability.  Additional optional capabilities, features, or accessories should be listed separately from the base requirement for information only. Question 9: What level of resolution will be required in the data?  What level of software processing and data manipulation will be needed?  Answer 9: A minimum of 16 bit data processing is required. Question 10: What is meant by "manipulate nano-matter with accuracy and precision"?  To what level of precision?  How far? Of what material and in what medium?  Answer 10: This is a general manipulation at the nano-level capability requirement.  Vendors should provide published results demonstrating repeatable manipulation capability at the nano-level.  Question 11: Are other materials characterization techniques needed, such as Conductive AFM, MFM, etc? Answer 11: The solicitation is for base requirements.  Additional optional capabilities, features, or accessories should be listed separately from the base requirement for information only. Question 12: If a variety of research needs exist, please rank them in order of importance.  Answer 12: The initial use is for material studies, device development, and inspection. Question 13: Should we include installation and/or training on our submission?	The solicitation does not specify, and we do not want to quote more than what is absolutely necessary since it seems this bid will be awarded solely on price.  The same comment could be made for accessories like monitors, keyboards, etc. Answer 13: Yes, installation and training should be included in the quote.  Vendors should describe the installation and training to be provided.  Additional optional capabilities, features, or accessories should be listed separately from the base requirement for information only. Question 14: The solicitation specifies that the "System shall demonstrate the capability of consistently, and repeatedly, manipulate nano-matter with accuracy and precision."  This specification seems very vague to us, and we are at a loss as to how NASA will determine which vendors meet this specification and how they will be ranked.  Furthermore, we are at a loss as to what information we need to supply that will show we meet the specification.  Typically, solicitors will specify several items that could include: showing previously published results of this technique using their equipment, lists of manipulation functions, feature sizes to be moved or manipulated, etc.  The "accuracy and precision" part is a little disconcerting since we have no idea what NASA considers as accurate or precise.  Also, since our equipment is versatile, there is more than one way to perform this technique.  Our nanomanipulation option is the most user-friendly and comprehensive (and we assume this is what NASA would want), but we could also quote the system without this option and still be able to meet the specification (although the end-user would have a large amount of custom work to be performed on his end).	Again, since the lowest priced vendor that meets the specifications will win the solicitation, it put us in the position of making a difficult choice between quoting a system that is actually productive vs. quoting a system that could win the solicitation. Answer 14: This is a general nano-level manipulation capability requirement.  Vendors should provide published results demonstrating repeatable manipulation capability at the nano-level. Question 15: The solicitation specifies a Z axis resolution, but what we think the requestor is really looking for is to specify both a Z axis resolution and a Z axis noise floor.	It makes little difference for the Z axis to have 0.05nm resolution if the system's Z axis noise floor is above that level.  It is a "weakest link in the chain" issue that governs the ultimate resolution of an AFM in the Z axis.  Answer 15: The resolution in Z includes the noise level. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on August 22, 2005.

3.0	MISSION

In an era characterized by social, technological developments and changes, it is essential that organizations have able leaders, at many levels and in many places.

Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  USTDA would like to re-emphasize the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Toward this goal, the Agency is collecting more detailed information regarding the impact of its activities on the economic development of the host country.

What does USTDA mean by Development Impact?
USTDA’s activities impact host country economic development in a variety of ways.  There are four primary categories that are tracked and measured.  However, the Agency recognizes that there are additional ways that activities can benefit the host country.  Therefore, study contractors are encouraged to address any significant benefits. 

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure	USTDA funds feasibility studies of and technical assistance for many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reform	Many USTDA activities have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the Agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The Agency’s projects result in the introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses that improve processes and/or systems , resulting in greater economic productivity or more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories - examples include enhanced government revenue, increased good governance or spin-off projects.






 
How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development Impact?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project.  For example:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential Development Impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the host country.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

·	Infrastructure: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

·	Market-Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

·	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

·	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%).

·	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA?  

·	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country Development Impact of the FS or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.

<DESC>6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The purpose of this DM is twofold:  to identify projects and delegates for an India Refineries Orientation Visit, and to evaluate projects in the refinery sector in India and Pakistan that meet USTDA funding criteria.

The refinery sector is undergoing major changes in both India and Pakistan, due to increasingly stringent environmental regulations as well as changing demands in the refined products market.  In India, refineries are faced with a need to both quantitatively and qualitatively upgrade their production.  The Government of India has supported a number of initiatives to promote cleaner fuels, including more stringent environmental standards, such as the reduction of sulfur content in fuels.  In addition, the market for petroleum products is changing quickly; with demand for petroleum products growing at a steady rate of 7% per annum, petroleum product production is predicted to increase from present 110MMTPA to 368MMTPA over the next 20 years.  India is experienced in the efficient operation of petroleum refineries, but the huge capital and technological requirements for major expansions will require foreign expertise.  U.S. companies are particularly competitive in this sector, and it is expected that the downstream sector in India will require investments of at least $10 billion over the next five years. 


	To take advantage of these changes in the Indian refinery sector, USTDA approved funding for an India Refineries Modernization Orientation Visit (OV) in March 2005.  This OV will introduce delegates to U.S. companies with appropriate technologies and services for substantial refinery upgrades intended to increase supply of value added products, improve efficiency and meet new specifications for cleaner fuel.  This is an active and promising sector in India, and we believe the OV’s impact would be strengthened by additional project definition.  For this reason, the DM Contractor will be expected to research the Indian sector thoroughly and meet with promising project sponsors for inclusion in the OV.  The information gathered by the DM Contractor will be given to the OV Contractor to plan an effective and focused Orientation Visit.  Specifically, the DM Contractor will be expected to gather detailed information on 6-8 projects and recommend appropriate delegates for the OV.  The DM Contractor will not be expected to provide a Terms of Reference or budget for the projects in India relating to the OV.  Instead, the Contractor will be asked to provide a summary of each project, a list of recommended delegates, and a list of potential site visits and meetings to be included in the OV itinerary.  These projects must be described and assessed in detail along USTDA guidelines (see Section 3 of this contract for relevant criteria).  The DM Contractor shall also provide detailed information on which U.S. companies are already involved in this sector in India.  In general, the DM Contractor will be expected to liaise with the OV Contractor upon award of the DM contract, and throughout the duration of the DM contract, as needed.  In identifying projects and individuals to be included in the OV, the DM Contractor will be expected to meet and work closely with the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), each of which has bilateral programs for cleaner fuels in India.  

In Pakistan, energy consumption has nearly tripled in the last 20 years to an annual consumption of approximately 17.5 million tons of petroleum products.  Pakistan is experiencing a rapid growth in consumption of petroleum products, at a rate of about 5-7% per annum.  Imports of crude and petroleum products have escalated in recent years, fueling concerns over energy security and national debt.  Pakistan’s natural gas reserves are estimated at about 27 trillion cubic feet, which places the country fourth in Asia, behind Malaysia, Indonesia and China.  The energy policy of Pakistan is to focus on the development of indigenous resources including hydropower, coal, and natural gas in order to avoid petroleum imports.  Pakistan has also implemented stricter environmental regulations, and the government is encouraging refineries to meet and/or exceed the standards that have been established.  These increasingly stringent environmental regulations, coupled with decreased demand for fuel furnace oil, are forcing refineries in Pakistan to undergo substantial upgrades to stay in operation and to meet future petroleum product specifications.  USTDA has provided funding for feasibility studies for upgrades at two of Pakistan’s refineries, which are progressing well.  The DM Contractor would be expected to provide updates on these two projects and identify further projects for USTDA funding in Pakistan.

The DM Contractor will be expected to travel to the region to meet with relevant government officials, project sponsors, U.S. companies, U.S. Embassy officials and financial institutions.  The DM Contractor must be able to mobilize and travel shortly after the contract award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; pr oposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05. This solicitation is issued as a request for pr o posal (RFP) as a small business set-aside from C-E LCMC Acquisition Center, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703, AMESL AC-CA-RT-P, and the number assigned to it is W15P7T-05-R-D212. The proposed action is for a four (4) month, Firm-Fixed Price type contract. The Co nt ractor will perform contract closeouts on 435 contracts for the period of 30 September 2005 through 31 January 2006. The contracts will be closed out in accordance with all Federal and Defense Rules and Regulations, and CE-LCMC Policies and Procedures. T h e contractor can invoice monthly, and will be paid for each contract closed out during subject calendar month at a rate of the total proposed cost divided by 435. Army Working Capitol Funds, Army appropriations will be utilized for this effort. The Gove rn ment will provide office space, computers, phones, fax, email, supplies and access to applicable areas and databases for contract closeout for up to three personnel. Travel is not anticipated but will be in compliance with the Joint Travel Regulation (J TR ). Contractor employees will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement. Offerors are required to complete and submit a copy of the FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; this provision is to be sent as a s eparate electronic attachment. Proposals must be submitted by 15 September 2 005 at 1600. The anticipated award date is on or around 23 September 2005. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541611 with the small business size standard being under $6M. Ple ase contact Mark Junda, mark.junda@mail1.monmouth.army.mil, 732-532-8344, with any questions or concerns. The US Army CECOM has established the IBOP website as part of the Armys Single Face to Industry, to allow electronic posting of Solicitation for Requ est for Proposals (RFPs), Request for Quotations (RFQs), and Invitations for Bids (IFBs) from C-E LCMC to industry. All parties interested in doing business with C-E LCMC are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the IBOP at http ://abop.monmouth.army.mil See Numbered Notes 1. FAR 52.212-2 The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. Price 2. Past Performance 3. Technical Capability (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within t he time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the of fers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are nego tiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The following clauses are incorporated by reference: 52.222-3 Convict Labor. 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting. 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities  52.222-26 Equal Opportunity 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Vet erans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Pu rchases 52.212-4 Contract Terms and ConditionsComm ercial Items 52.232-29 Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Items 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds TransferCentral Contractor Registration 52.237-3 Continuity of Services ***ANSWERS TO SUBMITTED QUESTIONS*** Q1.  Are these all Firm Fixed Price with evidence of physical completion?  If not can you give an approximate mix of PO/DO, fixed price contracts, labor hour, IDIQ, and cost reimbursable contracts? A1.  A mix of all types of contracts including cost will be supplied. Coordination with ACOs and DCAA will be required. We have both DCMA and DCAA liaisons in house.  No approximate mix can be given at this time. Q2.  Does this include IDIQ contracts with delivery orders that are not part of the 435 count, and if so are we required to document closeout of individual delivery orders before closing the contract? A2.  Individual DOs must be closed out. A DO is considered as a closed out contract in the 435 count. Q3.  Are the physical files in good order, and/or will the contractor be required to reconstruct missing award/modification or other significant documents? A3.  Most files are in good order, however reconstruction of files and transferred work from other buying activities will exist. Q4.  Will we have a single CO/KO as point of contact for signing off on closeouts, or will we be working with various COs/KOs? A4.  A CO/KO is designated as a team leader. However coordination with the CO/KO of records may be required. Q5.  Will contracts be considered closed when payment is authorized, or do the records have to be closed in DFAS?  A5.  Closeouts are considered complete for the 435 count when brought to a point inherently governmental remaining. If a de-obligation is required the amount is to be noted by the closeout contractor but does not need to be cleared through DFAS to count fo r the 435 count, provided the work submitted was in accordance with the standards in the PWS.  Q6.  Am I to understand you correctly, that at each contract close out that times the rate per contract (contract x rate = billing dollars amount). A6.  The contractor will be paid a rate per contract closed out.  ie: If the contractor performs 30 contract closeouts in a month, and the rate per contract is $2, they will bill as follows: (# of contracts closed out) x (amt per contract closed out) 30 x $2 = $60 Q7.  Will a proposal be required or can a contractor submit a GSA Schedule? A7.  This acquisition is not being procured through a GSA Schedule.  Therefore a proposal should be submitted in accordance with the synopsis posted to the ASFI/FedBizOpps website on 31 August 2005. Q8.  Would the Government consider a different NAICS code for this procurement? A8.  The current NAICS code, 541611, best reflects the type of effort described in the PWS.  No waivers will be granted.
