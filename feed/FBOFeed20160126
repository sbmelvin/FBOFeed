<RESPDATE>022516
<CONTACT>Craig H. Cunningham, Phone 4073845263, Email craig.h.cunningham.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT: Market Research is being conducted to verify that no other sources can meet the requirement to develop, integrate, and install the Field Modification 2 (FM2) concurrency upgrades on the Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS and manufacture, produce, and install mobile Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS systems. Interested sources are invited to provide their company's capability statement to support this program as described in this Sources Sought program description, acquisition approach, and delivery schedule as described herein.
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training (LM MST) has been the sole source, prime contractor since the inception of the Abrams AGTS program competitively awarded in 1994, and for all subsequent upgrades and improvements to the Abrams AGTS and its derivatives. The Abrams AGTS upgrades and improvements are based on a proprietary system design developed at private expense by LM MST and 10 U.S.C. 2320(a)(2)(F)(i) precludes the Department of Defense from making release or sale of proprietary technical data a condition of contracting with the Government. The Government possesses only Limited Purpose Data Rights, with Restricted Data Rights on some software components. The Manufacturing Technical Data Package (TDP), which includes manufacturing drawings, hardware technical data, crew station molds, and runtime software, is not owned by the Government.</p>
<p>Product Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (PdM GCTT) has a requirement to upgrade the Abrams AGTS training devices to be concurrent with changes made to the Abrams Tank under the FM2 effort to ensure that the AGTS system trains Soldiers with the exact same functionality that crews will encounter in the tactical vehicle. The contractor will develop the hardware and software modifications and then deliver and install the upgrade kits at all Abrams AGTS sites. In total, the contractor shall provide hardware and software upgrade kits (including documentation updates) for fifty-two (52) M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS systems.</p>
<p>PdM GCTT has a requirement to produce and deliver two mobile M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS systems to Ft. Bliss, Texas. The contractor will produce two new mobile M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS and spares based on the existing designs for already-fielded systems, conduct production testing with Government personnel, and deliver them to the site. Once on-site, the contractor will setup the system and conduct on-site acceptance testing with Government personnel to ensure full functionality of the system.</p>
<p>PdM GCTT has a requirement to produce and deliver two mobile M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS systems to Camp Buehring, Kuwait. Upon the exercise of the option for two mobile M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS systems, the contractor will produce two new mobile M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS systems and spares based on the existing designs for already-fielded systems, conduct production testing with Government personnel, and deliver them to the site. Once on-site, the contractor will setup the system and conduct on-site acceptance testing with Government personnel to ensure full functionality of the system.</p>
<p>ACQUISITION APPROACH: PEO STRI Acquisition Center intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Subpart 16.505 (b) (2) (i) (B). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to award a new Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Order (DO) under STOC II, W900KK-09-D-0314 to LM MST with a Time and Material (T&amp;M) contract line item number. Execution of the contract is projected for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2017 (FY17). The total contract period of performance will not exceed 30 September 2019, to include all options.</p>
<p>LM MST alone possesses the required system technical data and knowledge needed to integrate subsystems effectively to meet user performance criteria. Consequently, the proprietary designs of AGTS as described are unique to LM MST. Since upgrades and improvements will use the existing AGTS as a basis for the upgraded components, knowledge of the existing system is imperative in order to ensure a smooth transition between the current AGTS and the improved AGTS configuration.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED ACQUISITION DOLLAR VALUE: Approximately $7M</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE/DELIVERY: Production, delivery, installation, and testing of the Abrams FM2 concurrency upgrades is due 12 months after contract award. Production, delivery, installation, and testing of the two new mobile M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS systems for Ft. Bliss, TX is due one year and six months after contract award. Production, delivery, installation, and testing of the two new mobile M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS systems for Camp Buehring, Kuwait is due one year and six months after the option is exercised.</p>

Responses shall provide a description of the offeror's ability to meet the Abrams AGTS program description, acquisition approach, and delivery schedule. See attached Statement of Work. The response shall include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate for the requirement on an FFP basis. The offeror's capability statement may not include any new or non-recurring design effort.</p>

<p>Responses shall be submitted electronically by email to Craig.Cunningham.civ@mail.mil no later than 1500 EST on 25 February 2016.</p>
<p>NOTICE: This notice of intent to award sole source is being provided to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement given only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition. Contractors are advised that a determination by the Government not to compete this effort based on any responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government IAW FAR Part 6.</p>

<SUBJECT>Personal Dust Monitors - Notice of Sole Source
<SOLNBR>2016-Q-64659
<RESPDATE>021016
<CONTACT>Katie L. Oyler, Phone 4123864450, Email ycy4@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / National Institute Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to award a sole source contract to Thermo Environmental Instruments, Inc. for the procurement of ten (10) PDM 3700 personal dust monitors. One of the goals of the Dust, Ventilation, and Toxic Substances Branch is to reduce coal mine workers' exposure to respirable coal mine dust. As part of this research, it is necessary to quantify the respirable dust exposure of these workers and identify major sources of dust liberation in the mines. Mass based sampling instruments provide the most accurate measurement of these exposures. If these exposures can be monitored and recorded on a time basis, it allows researchers to identify the highest sources of dust exposure. Consequently, it is necessary to use respirable dust sampling instrumentation that is person-wearable, mass-based, records real time data, and is approved for use in underground mines. The PDM 3700 dust monitor is the only instrument that can perform the needed functions and is certified by both Mine Safety and health Administration (MSHA) and NIOSH for use in underground mining environments.<br /><br />This contract action is for commercial services and/or supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responses received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government whether or not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response should be emailed to Kate Oyler at ycy4@cdc.gov by 3:00 PM EST on February 10, 2016.

<DESC>In accordance with Section 3.2.2.4 of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS), the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.  The FAA intends to enter into negotiations on a single source basis with Hoh Aeronautics, Inc., Lomita, CA.

The FAA has a requirement for advanced flight control expertise via technical support and services during simulation testing of Advanced Flight Controls (AdFC) on rotorcraft using the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS). The FAA needs the data that will be generated by NASA Ames VMS to validate the guidance developed by Hoh Aeronautics, Inc. under an existing FAA Aviation Research Grant to develop the rulemaking to support AdFC use on rotorcraft. Knowledge of that work is imperative to support the simulation being done by NASA. That knowledge will be used to develop the test plan and execute the simulation work at NASA. This knowledge resides with Hoh Aeronautics, Inc. as a result of the work under our grant.

A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement.  If your firm does not agree with the single source determination, please provide evidence of your firms capabilities and experience in providing the aforementioned services and the FAA will evaluate accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to William Bleda, William.Bleda@faa.gov no later than 5pm EDT on January 29, 2016.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve quality of life.
<p>The Civil Rights and Diversity Office (CRDO) promotes accessibility for employees and visitors. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, require the Government to provide reasonable accommodation to employees, applicants and visitors. Reasonable accommodation can include, but is not limited to, providing sign language services. Sign language services are provided so that manually communicating employees or visitors who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can participate equally in all facets of their employment or visit at NIST.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four deaf employees who require sign language services on a regular basis for meetings, trainings, and other events. Additionally, NIST hosts a variety of events (such as tours, colloquium talks, conferences and meetings) which are open to the public and may require sign language services. NIST plans to utilize Contractors to provide sign language services on an "as needed" basis to meet requirements, which may vary widely.</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to provide expressive and receptive sign language services for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Services may be required at NIST campuses located in Gaithersburg, MD, Boulder, Colorado, and/or Charleston, SC. It is anticipated that the majority of services will be provided on-site at the Gaithersburg, MD campus. Services may also be required at venues other than the NIST campus.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990 with a small business size standard of <br />$15.0 million. Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized under the authority <br />of FAR Parts 12 and 13. This requirement is 100% set-aside for women-owned small business. Award of multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements are anticipated.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-15-RQ-0544.</p>
<p>Potential quoters shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential quoter to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately four (4) days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

<SUBJECT>Respiratory Illness Live Virus Fill / Finish Services 
<SOLNBR>16-100-SOL-00011
<CONTACT>Matthew A. McCord, Phone 2022600689, Email matthew.mccord@hhs.gov - Quintin K. Hackshaw, Phone 2022600453, Email quintin.hackshaw@hhs.gov
<DESC>The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), seeks to establish Medical Countermeasure Fill / Finish capabilities to facilitate Live Virus/ Vectored Vaccine Medical Countermeasure (MCM) product development towards licensure. BARDA has a specific need to create core services to support cGMP and non-GMP filling and finishing of a variety of Medical Countermeasure products; small molecule, large molecule, live virus, lyophilized, pre-clinical, clinical, at pilot and commercial scale.  BARDA needs Live Virus/ Vectored Vaccine Medical Countermeasure Fill / Finish core services for BARDA-sponsored product developers and manufacturers that may not have the appropriate or adequate manufacturing facilities or expertise.  Additionally, during a public health medical emergency, Medical Countermeasure Fill / Finish services beyond current Government capacities may be needed to provide finished products rapidly to address the medical emergency.  Through a set of contractual agreements, BARDA will establish Fill / Finish Manufacturing capabilities and capacities in order to provide a wide-array of live virus/ vectored vaccine product services to meet BARDA requirements. BARDA will coordinate the activities as they are awarded under this IDIQ contract.
<p>As directed by Task Order(s), contractors shall provide fill and finish services to support the development of live virus/ vectored vaccine Medical Countermeasure candidates and/or other MCMs as identified.  Once the contractor is established as a live virus/vectored vaccine fill and finish service provider, other services may be requested via task order.  Examples of other products which could potentially be requested are small molecule sterile injectables, large molecule sterile injectables, monoclonal antibodies, pre-clinical, clinical, and FDA approved MCMs.  Fill / Finish services can also be requested for rapid response during a public health emergency.  Expectations of Fill / Finish services and timelines will be specified in the Task Order (e.g. routine or urgent).  Contractors will provide a wide range of fill and finish services, relevant to BARDA's vision to create a nation with the capability to respond quickly and effectively to natural and emerging threats by providing a range of fill and finish services, which can be used by BARDA and BARDA's development partners.</p>
<p>The two objectives of the requirement are as follows:<br /> <br />Objective 1: Fill / Finish Services: Contractors shall provide technology transfer and fill and finish services of live virus/ vectored vaccine and other types of MCM products that include the capability to process clinical investigational lots, engineering lots, process validation lots, and commercial-scale lots. Services may include, but are not limited to: technology transfer, lyophilization development, analytical testing, process optimization, process validation, formulation, filling, labeling, packaging, and distribution.</p>
<p>Services may be provided to support the fill and finish of pharmaceuticals including parenteral drug products, monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, antitoxins, and vaccines. As per the USG requirement, these liquid, lyophilized, or powder drug products may be filled and finished as prefilled syringes or sprayers, cartridges, auto-injectors, single dose or multi-dose vials.</p>
<p>Objective 2: Rapid MCM Response Readiness: Contractors shall augment the existing US-based vaccine fill and finish infrastructure surge capacity for medical countermeasures, emerging infectious diseases, and other threats of known and unknown origin during a public health emergency, as described in Objective I. Once a public health emergency has been declared, the Contractor shall provide fill and finish services in response to a USG T/DOR. The T/DOR will outline a target timeline for completion of services to address the ongoing public health emergency.</p>
<p>The USG anticipates that there may be other life-saving products being produced for commercial needs at the selected contractors' facilities. The delivery schedule for medical countermeasures will be negotiated between the USG and the contractors on a case by case basis to ensure supply of all priority life-saving products is maintained at appropriate levels.<br />The Government intends to have a full &amp; open competition for this requirement in the form of an RFP. This synopsis is not the RFP. The RFP itself is anticipated to be posted in, or after, February 10, 2016. The Government expects to make 1 or more awards, subject to the availability of funds. The due dates for proposals will be specified in the RFP itself.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The St Elizabeths site is approximately 176 acres and is a National Historic Landmark (NHL) site containing primarily office space and parking structures with some special buildings for conferences and food service. The site, located one mile east of DC on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, is the former St. Elizabeths Hospital site in Anacostia, Washington, DC. Three phases are planned in total, with a phasing summary as follows: Phase 1 - new construction for the U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters (USCG) (1,179,500 gsf) [awarded September 2009] Adaptive reuse of historic buildings for DHS at 179,250 gsf; Phase 2 - The Center Building for DHS, Central Utility Plant and DHS Operations Center, a mix of new construction and adaptive reuse projects along with FEMA Headquarters at 1.7 million gsf and Phase 3 - a combination adaptive reuse and new construction for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and DHS (1,398,150 gsf).</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Central Utility Plant Expansion (CUP2) project at St. Elizabeths is a follow-up project to work completed during Phase 1 development of the campus. The Phase 1 Central Utility Plant, constructed to support the US Coast Guard Headquarters (Munro Building), is an existing two story below grade structure with an above grade "head house" utilized for equipment and personnel access. The upper (LL1) level is dedicated to electrical systems, consisting of emergency generators and switch gear, the lower (LL2) level contains boilers, chillers, and fuel storage for the emergency generators, as well as office space for operations personnel. The CUP1 and a temporary Modular Utility Plant (MUP) are sized to accommodate only the portions of campus built out during Phase 1- the Douglas A. Munro USCG Headquarters, portions of the Departmental Operations Center A (DOC A), and Buildings 31, 33, 40, 41, 48, and 49. In order for the next phase (Phase 2A) of campus construction to be brought on line, the Central Utility Plant must be expanded to accommodate this additional area. These next phases include the Center Building Complex, the West Addition, and additional build-out space within DOC A. Ideally, the CUP2 would be operational not only in time for occupancy of these buildings, but in time to condition these building sites for interior construction, thereby saving costs for temporary air handling units. The CUP2 building is planned to accommodate the remaining equipment needed for the campus build out.</span></p>

<strong> </strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Miami, FL that will be expiring August 21, 2015. The Government intends to negotiate a succeeding lease for 10,630 ANSI BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet and 28 surface parking spaces based on economic, mission, and other factors.  The Government will consider alternative space only if economical and other factors are supportive. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, occupancy schedule, and quality of space.</p>

<DESC>The Architect Engineer (AE) firm shall provide architectural and design services necessary to furnish: Schematics, Design Development, Construction Documents, Technical Specifications, Construction Period Services, Site Visits, Cost Estimates, As-Built Documentation, and all other related information for the Project 506-330, Expand 8th Floor Mental Health AE Design at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System in Ann Arbor, MI as described below:
 
Scope of project:
 
1.	The consultant shall provide all necessary architectural and engineering (A-E) design services as required to prepare complete contract drawings, specifications, technical reports, and cost estimates, including services throughout construction for Expanding the 8th Floor Mental Health/Services,  Project # 506-330 at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. Work shall include all site work, utility connections, communication wiring and connection as well as any disruptions to existing systems.  

a.	This project will involve the removal of the existing audiology booths, wet laboratory space and the renovation of approximately 15,000 square feet of office, restroom, and approximately 5,000 square feet of corridor spaces on the Eighth floor.

b.	In addition, the project will include the demolition of the decommissioned ambulance garage and the construction of 4,500 square feet of new space encompassing three floors and a connection to the lower floor via an open stairwell. The adjoining first floor area will be renovated to provide a lobby area and an extension of the exterior healing garden.

c.	Work shall include all site work, utility connections, communication wiring and connection as well as any disruptions to existing systems.  

2.	  The selected firm will be required to fully evaluate the existing and present conditions.  They will be required to review any background documents, asbestos survey and lead assessments of the existing area, original drawings, and other information in the VA engineering office for information related to their design.  The firm is welcome to make copies at the engineering office of any documents and drawings.  The engineering section will transfer any electronic documents to a FTP type site the AE has set up.  Many times drawing files are too large to transfer via email.  It is the intent of the Department of Veterans Affairs to have the A-E survey the existing conditions and not rely solely on old background drawings for their design.  The VA makes no guarantee to the accuracy of background drawings, as most of the drawings are copies of original construction drawings and not "As Built" in nature.  The VA does complete regular asbestos and lead assessments and believes these to be accurate.  The AE will have full access to these surveys. 

Note: A/E shall be responsible for conducting site visits for the purpose of data gathering, investigation and documentation of all existing conditions.  Perform such investigations as required to accurately verify all existing conditions.  Do not rely solely upon "as built" drawings.  VA personnel will provide assistance with investigating the project site where prior experience with equipment and utilities will produce an appreciable advantage.

In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of the resulting construction price range is estimated to be between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.
 
Prospective firms are required to address all selection criteria within submitted SF330 packages using additional pages as required. Selection criteria shall be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.602-1 and VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Part 836.602-1 as follows:

1.	 Professional Qualifications: the qualifications of the individuals which will be used for these services will be examined for experience and education and their record of working together as a team. The specific disciplines which will be evaluated are Architects, Engineers, Estimators, CAD operators and Project Managers.

2.	Specialized Experience and Technical Competence:  specific experience and technical skill in the type and scope of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.

3.	Capacity to Accomplish the Work: the general work load and staffing capacity of the design office which will be responsible for the majority of the design and the ability to accomplish the work in the required time will be evaluated. 

4.	Past Performance: the past performance of the firm on contracts relevant in scope to the advertised project that were accomplished with the Department of Veterans Affairs, other Government agencies, and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules will be examined. Project past performance references older than 5 years will receive a lesser score than those references for projects accomplished within the past 5 years. 

5.	Location of Design Firm: the geographic proximity of each firm to the location of the VA Medical Center will be evaluated. This criterion will apply to the office from which the majority of the design services will be performed.  Firms within 250 miles of the medical center will receive a maximum score. Firms more distant than 250 miles will receive a zero score for this criterion.

6.	Claims and Terminations: record of significant claims against the firm or terminated contracts because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services will be examined.

7.	Reputation in A-E Community: reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.


FAILURE TO CLEARLY ADRESS ALL SEVEN LISTED EVALUATION CRITERIA AND INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF SF330.

The NAICS Codes for this procurement is 541310 Engineering Services. Award of a Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.  Anticipate award of contract with successful AE firm is June 2, 2016.  Anticipated time for completion of design is approximately 259 calendar days including time for VA reviews.

As a potential supplier of this (these) item (s), we are asking that you fill out this market survey to the best of your knowledge so that we can generate a realistic and beneficial solicitation.  Should any of the survey questions not apply (Cost or Pricing Data, First Article Testing, etc.) please skip over that section.<br /><br />&nbsp;Feel free to contact the sender of this survey if you have any questions.    Request that you return the survey within 7 business days of receipt.  We sincerely appreciate your time, and thank you for providing this information.    * <br /><br />Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC):  These contracts are intended for use with items for which recurring demands are anticipated, and as a means of reducing the time and expense required to solicit and make repetitive individual awards.<br /><br />&nbsp;Establishment of an IQ Contract (called a &ldquo;Basic Contract&rdquo;) will permit future Purchase Requests to be awarded by issuing a delivery order against the basic contract.  All terms, conditions, and pricing are negotiated/awarded up front with the basic, allowing the delivery order to be issued quickly.  Most contract terms will be for a one (1) up to a three (3) year base with the possibility of two (2), up to four (4) option years.  The items on the contract will be ordered on each delivery order (DO) within stated minimum and maximum quantities, and on an as needed basis.

COST OR PRICING DATA: <br /><br />The following pertain to the requirement for certified Cost or Pricing Data.  For contracts estimated over $700,000.00*, certified Cost or Pricing Data &ldquo;may&rdquo; be required.  FAR 15.408, Table 15-2 contains the guidelines for submitting this data.  <br />A sample format can be found at http://www.dcaa.mil.  At this website, go to &ldquo;Publications&rdquo; and click on &ldquo;Information for Contractors.&rdquo;  Navigate to Chapter 3 for guidance on pricing proposals. <br /> You can also view a Checklist on this website which highlights common inadequacies found in certified data.  This checklist is called &ldquo;Criteria for Adequate Contract Pricing Proposals&rdquo; on the DCAA website.  See provision FAR 52.215-20. <br /> Questions regarding cost or pricing data can be addressed to the Contract Specialist, your cognizant DCAA or DCMA office or the DLA Land &amp; Maritime Business Counseling Center (BCC) at 1-800-262-3272 or email: DSCC.BCC@dla.mil.   <br />*Note:  The value of the contract is based on the Contract Maximum dollar value that is in the Contract Limitations clause of a solicitation.  This Contract Maximum is based on the estimated combined value of all items on the solicitation, inclusive of all contract years combined (base year plus option years) and is then inflated to allow for a possible increase in annual demands over the life of the contract.     <br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: Cost or pricing data is not required for commercial items.  However, it is the contracting officer&rsquo;s authority to determine an item(s) commercial or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;COMMERCIAL QUESTIONS:<br />&nbsp;1.	Are any of these items Commercial Items per FAR 2.101(b)?&nbsp; Yes&nbsp; No  NOTE:  If yes, please indicate on the attached spreadsheet which specific NSNs are commercial.  If you state items are commercial, then please send with survey &ldquo;Un-Redacted Commercial Invoices&rdquo; for the exact items. <br /><br /> Please Note: Your Un-Redacted Invoices can be marked &ldquo;Proprietary and Confidential&rdquo; as we will only use them for determination for Price reasonableness.  They will also be Source Selection Information per FAR 2.101 and 3.104 and will only be used for the Solicitation which will be the result of this Market Research, and will not be published or made public.     <br /><br />&nbsp;The Government, and the Government only, must determine not only if an item is commercial but also if the commercial prices are Fair and Reasonable.  This is usually accomplished through proof that commercial market forces have driven the setting of the commercial price.  Such proof would describe the commercial market acceptance of the price or, more plainly, invoices proving that the item has been sold commercially at like prices, for like quantities.<br /><br />&nbsp;Is your company willing and able to provide such proof, if the government determines it is needed to verify price reasonableness:&nbsp; Yes &nbsp;&nbsp; No<br />&nbsp;NOTE:  Without proof of commerciality the LTC project cannot be processed as a commercial procurement (FAR Part 12), but will rather be processed using non-commercial procurement procedures (FAR Part 15).<br /><br />&nbsp;VI.	FOB POINT and PACKAGING QUESTIONS: <br /> 1.	The Government prefers that contractors offer on an FOB Origin, Destination Inspection basis. This is based on the First Destination Transportation Initiative.  The solicitation will also incorporate DLA&rsquo;s new packaging approach called First Destination Packaging Initiative (FDPI) in an effort to reduce material costs.  Past procurements have utilized Military Standard Packaging (MIL-STD-2073-1D).  This acquisition will substitute the Standard Commercial Packaging equivalent (ASTM D-3951) where applicable.  <br /><br />There are exceptions to FDT, for example Specific NSN&rsquo;s, FMS, Hazardous, etc.  Which will still need to be shipped FOB Destination these will be noted on the accompanying spreadsheet. Please note that there are exceptions to FDPI, those NSN(s) will be also noted on the accompanying spreadsheet.  a.	For those items which require FOB Destination basis. Your price would include transportation charges to any location in the United States. Is FOB Destination acceptable?&nbsp; YES&nbsp; NO<br />&nbsp;b.	Does your price typically include FOB Destination?&nbsp; YES&nbsp; NO.<br /><br />&nbsp;c.	If this solicitation is FOB Destination, would the government incur savings if unit prices were based on various shipping destinations (zones) within the US?&nbsp; YES&nbsp; NO  <br /><br />d.&nbsp; Is the NSN on this project will significantly impact Shipping Prices (Example: size or weight ) ? YES&nbsp;&nbsp; NO  <br /><br />e.	Would you typically provide the same price for anywhere in the US?&nbsp; YES&nbsp; NO <br /> 2.	Will the Government see any savings in the transport cost?  0 Yes   0 No    a.	If yes, advise a percentage or dollar amount of that reduction in the transportation cost?        3.	Can you provide STD-COM PKG with MIL-STD-129 Markings?&nbsp; Yes&nbsp; No<br /><br />&nbsp;VII.	DELIVERY QUESTIONS: <br />1.	Would you require phased delivery for quantities up to the QFD quantity? Yes No.<br />&nbsp;If so, what would the phased delivery be?        	  <br /><br />2.	Is there a Maximum Quantity that you could deliver for the item(s)? &nbsp; Yes&nbsp; No.  	<br />If yes, please list on the attached spreadsheet the applicable maximum monthly quantity for each item. <br /><br /> 3.	Would a minimum delivery order quantity and/or dollar value apply to these NSNs?&nbsp; Yes &nbsp; No.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;If yes, please annotate on the attached spreadsheet and list the applicable minimum for each item. <br /> 4.	Please complete the estimated delivery schedule per item above. <br /><br />VIII.	MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS:  <br />1.Technical Requirements of the item(s);&nbsp; Production Lot Testing is be required. Is your company willing to submit to the specific testing for this project? &nbsp; Yes &nbsp;&nbsp; No <br /><br /> 2.	The Government typically establishes a Guaranteed Minimum amount for each contract, ranging anywhere from 1% to 10% of the forecasted Annual Demand Quantity/Value. <br /><br /> a.	Would a higher guaranteed minimum percentage affect your pricing? Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />No  Please explain: <br /><br /> IX.	FINAL COMMENTS:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, a market survey for information to be used for preliminary planning purposes.

The intent of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to identify potential qualified Small Businesses, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Businesses, SBA certified HUBZone Small Businesses, Economically Disadvantaged WomenOwned Small Businesses, and/or ServiceDisabled VeteranOwned Small Businesses.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is one facet in the Governments overall market research in regards to whether the proposed solicitation will be issued as a competitive setaside or as full and open (unrestricted).
 No procurement strategy will be determined based solely on the information received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any followup information requests. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this market research.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest is seeking Small Business, SBA certified 8(a) Business, SBA certified HUBZone Small Business, Economically Disadvantaged WomenOwned Small Business, and/or ServiceDisabled VeteranOwned Small Business sources with current and relevant experience, personnel, and capability to selfperform a multiple award construction contract for new construction, repair, and renovation of Natural Gas and Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) fuel systems projects.
  

The term selfperform refers to performing relevant major trade work inhouse without subcontractors. This does not include administrative or management functions. Relevant major trade work is that which is the same or similar to the work that may be ordered under the proposed contract.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237120 (Oil and Gas Pipeline and Related Structures Construction) with a Small Business Size Standard of $36.5 million.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. 

The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information and capabilities for planning purposes and to determine appropriate strategies to meet the Agency's requirements. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quote (RFQ) or a commitment for an RFP/ RFQ in the future.

Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to the Sources Sought Notice. Information received from this Sources Sought Notice may be utilized in preparing potential solicitation documentation. It is the contractor's responsibility to identify proprietary information in response to this notice. 

The purpose of this announcement is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification. NAICS Code 541690 applies.
The Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System (SAVAHCS) is seeking potential sources capable of providing service to upgrade, re-build, program and maintain the Honeywell Energy Management System, document system configuration, provide monthly on-site software performance and data validation service, quarterly system training, and software maintenance/annual upgrade.
Background: Through a previous contract, SAVAHCS installed a Honeywell Energy Manager system as a 'front-end' to monitor energy information from four separate SAVAHCS systems.  The four systems are as follows: 1) JCI Metasys system (which contains more than 60,000 points); 2) Alerton system (which contains less than 5,000 point); 3) Advanced Metering System (which contains about 50 advanced meters); and 4) Solar PV system (which is comprised of 1 ground-mount array and 12 carport structure PV arrays).  The hardware of the Energy Management System is comprised of: 1) Honeywell Enterprise Building Integrator (EBI) server/software located in the USRO office; 2) Honeywell Energy Manager server/software located in USRO office; 3) JACE box located in USRO office; 4) Five Energy Management workstations with large screen monitors (two in Building 5, two in Building 2, and one in Building 38); and 5) One additional large screen monitor located in Building 2.  The Energy Management System also contains several specially-developed screens for monitoring data from the four systems.  One of the purposes Energy Management System is to gather and transmit 2-second data to Tucson Electric Power (TEP).  Due to IT concerns, the method for internal transmission of solar data and Advanced Metering data was dismantled and re-built differently, resulting in the JCI Metasys system and Alerton system to no longer being monitored or captured. IT has determined that utilizing Site-to-Site VPN for the transmission of the solar data to TEP will alleviate IT security concerns and will allow the Energy Management System to be re-built.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is F1M3B25345AW01. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, intends to award a sole source contract for AT&amp;T- Owned Telecommunications Maintenance Service for Joint Base Charleston Weapons Station.</p>
<p>The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Bellsouth Telecommunications, Inc. dba AT&amp;T, 2180 Lake Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319-6004. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c)(15), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii). This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals; however responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to provide outside plant operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) services for telecommunications voice and data circuits beyond the AT&amp;T established demarcation site to Building Entrance Terminals at end user building on Joint Base Charleston (JB CHS) Weapons Station, Goose Creek, SC.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) One source is capable of providing the service because AT&amp;T will not permit another company to have any accesses or rights to their cable.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: The infrastructure (wiring and equipment) specified under this requirement is owned by AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T is the only vendor authorized to provide outside plant O&amp;M services on AT&amp;T-owned infrastructure located on JB Charleston Weapons Station.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: IAW FAR 5.102(a) (2), this notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov), but retained in the contract file to document the rationale for a sole source award.</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon previous awards made for the same service.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: A search of other service providers in the areas revealed that they are not authorized to perform this service Joint Base Charleston.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: The infrastructure (wiring and equipment) is owned by AT&amp;T. It would not be economical to replace the present infrastructure with another company's infrastructure.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: Several companies were found who provide this service, however none are authorized to service and maintain AT&amp;T owned infrastructure.</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: <br />None at this time.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>

9. Project Information:  Legionella As-Built Drawings

a. Background:

Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) issued Directive 1061 on August 13, 2014. This Directive addresses the prevention of healthcare associated Legionella Disease and Scald Injury from potable water distribution systems in VHA-owned buildings in which patients, residents, or visitors stay overnight. 

In order to comply with the Legionella Directive, Edward Hines Jr. Veterans Affairs Hospital is required to implement water treatment and controls upon the existing water distribution system. The new system will include measures to monitor temperature, PH and oxidant levels in each building's potable water distribution systems(s) and scald prevention.   

Buildings directly impacted by these new requirements are:

"	Bldg. #5
"	Bldg. #100
"	Bldg. #217
"	Bldg. #221
 
For Building #5 hot and cold water treatment only. For buildings 100, 217 and 221, new monitors for sample testing need to be installed in order to comply with the above mentioned Directive.  

Research of existing records identified incomplete As-Builts, insufficient for establishing a basis for the intended design. As-Built drawings are critical for identifying the existing conditions and in developing the required water treatment and controls.

A complete set of As-Builts for each one of the buildings and site (utilities) is necessary in order to have the most updated data including campus water service and hot water distribution system. This information is essential for the accurate development of improvement and/or new construction designs and proposals.

<p>(m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall-</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. Send protests (other than protests to the Contracting Officer) to:</p>
<p>Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command<br />Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road<br />Rm: A6SE040.001<br />Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000<br />Phone: (256) 450-8165<br />Fax: (256) 450-8840<br />E-mail: amcprotests@conus.army.mil</p>

<p>5152.233-4000  AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM (FEB 2014) (LOCAL<br />CLAUSE)</p>
<p>Prior to submitting an agency protest, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve your concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is<br />to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.</p>
<p>Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command<br />Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel<br />4400 Martin Road<br />Rm: A6SE040.001<br />Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000</p>

<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p><br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:</p>
<p><br />This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS).  For an offer's submission to be determined "Technically Acceptable" and receive consideration for award based upon lowest price submitted, the offer must receive a rating of "Acceptable" for each technical acceptability standard and past performance factor.  The Government will award the contract to the offer that meets all the evaluation criteria with an "Acceptability" rating. Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors are not permitted.</p>
<p>A price analysis of the offer received will be in accordance with the techniques of FAR Part 15.404.  As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the offeror's final option period prices to the offeror's total price.  Thus, the offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period, first option period, second option period, and one-half of the second period.  Offerors are required to only price the base and two options.  Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential one-half year extension of services period.</p>
<p>In the event of an unacceptable past performance evaluation rating for an otherwise technically acceptable low price offeror, the Small Business Administration (SBA) will be contacted for a Certificate of Competency (COC) determination in accordance with procedures in FAR 19.601.  In the event an offeror receives a rating of "unacceptable" for both the Technical Acceptability Factor and Past Performance Factor, a COC determination will not be requested as the offeror would remain "Unacceptable" based on the evaluation of the Technical Acceptability Factor.</p>
<p>Discussions or Negotiations:  The offeror's initial offer should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  Discussions, if any, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.602 and final offers will be evaluated in accordance with factors as were initial offers.</p>
<p>Award for All of the Work:  The Government intends to award one contract as a result of this solicitation.  Offers received with less than the stated number of items listed in the Bid Schedule will be considered non- responsive.</p>
<p>a.  Evaluation Criteria.</p>
<p>(1)  Evaluation criteria consist of factors and elements as listed below.  The offers will be evaluated under three (3) evaluation factors:</p>
<p>Factor I:   Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>Acceptability Standard 1: Experience<br /> Acceptability Standard 2: Capability</p>
<p>Factor II:  Past Performance</p>
<p>Within the Past Performance (Quality of Products/ Services, Timeliness of Performance, and Business Relations will be evaluated).</p>
<p>Factor III:  Price</p>
<p>(2)  Factor I -Technical Acceptability:  The Technical Acceptability Factor evaluation provides an assessment of the offeror's capability to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptability Standard 1:  Experience:  The offeror demonstrates experience in performing work comparable to the magnitude  identified in the PWS.  The offeror shall submit a list of recent (within the past 3 years) and relevant contracts/subcontracts that demonstrate an ability to perform the work described in the solicitation.  Specifically, the orders/contracts should demonstrate three years' experience in grounds maintenance and landscaping.  Key Personnel, as identified in paragraph 2.1.12.1, qualifications will be evaluated to ensure the ability of the offeror to produce candidates who meet or exceed position requirements outlined in the PWS.</p>
<p>Acceptability Standard 2: Capability:  Offeror shall provide official documentation to support and confirm qualifications/experience as outlined in the PWS, paragraph 6.1.1.17.  This standard will be evaluated by assessing the offeror's proposal and its ability to demonstrate the following: offeror's ability to schedule the work, ensure adequate staffing, and supplies/materials to execute the work, ensure inspection services to ensure grounds maintenance standards are met, and procedures to ensure proper handling of hazardous materials, herbicides and pesticides.<br />The Technical Acceptability Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below.  The individual standards will not receive an adjectival rating.</p>
<p>Table 1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating	Description<br />Acceptable	Offer clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable	Offer does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(3)  Factor II - Past Performance:  The offeror shall submit a list of recent and relevant past contracts/subcontracts as defined below.  The past performance evaluation will assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  Past Performance is assessed at the factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror's recent past performance and focusing on past performance that is relevant to the services being procured under this solicitation. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's submission and data obtained from other sources, such as the Contractor Past Performance Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists.  Past performance areas of evaluation include:</p>
<p>- Business Relations<br />- Quality of Service<br />- Schedule<br />- Customer Satisfaction</p>
<p>Each offeror will receive a past performance rating of acceptable or unacceptable based on the Offeror's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements.</p>
<p>(a)  Recency Assessment:  An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>(b)  Relevancy Assessment:  To be relevant, the effort must be similar in nature of work, size, and complexity.  The Government will conduct an in depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine if it is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services being procured under this solicitation.  A relevancy determination of the offeror's (including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s)) past performance will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to what aspects of an offeror's contract history would give the most confidence that the offeror will satisfy the current procurement.  The past performance information provided in the offer and obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance.</p>
<p>The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to past performance rating.</p>
<p>Assigning Ratings.  The Past Performance Factor will be assigned one (1) of the rating defined below.</p>
<p>Table 2: Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating	Description<br />Acceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br /> Unacceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered acceptable.</p>
<p>(4)  Factor III: Price:  The Price factor will not be scored or rated.  Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more price analysis techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b). Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced.</p>
<p>(a)  Options.  Pricing submitted for the Offeror Schedule, will be evaluated for price reasonableness.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's total price, to include the base period, first option period, second option period, and one-half of the final option period, using price analysis techniques (See FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the offeror's final option period price to the offeror's total price..  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for an offeror to be considered for award.  Those offerors not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.  The Government will award a single contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are equally as important as cost or price.</p>
<p>(b)  Unbalanced Pricing.  Unbalanced pricing may be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), as applicable, to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.</p>

Length of<br />service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR<br />4.173)<br />HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin<br />Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with<br />pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR<br />4174)<br />THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE<br />FOLLOWING:<br />1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage<br />determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide<br />executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.<br />Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at<br />a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than<br />$455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29<br />C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all<br />occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may<br />not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the<br />survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or<br />exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt<br />employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs<br />duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer<br />Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage<br />rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this<br />wage<br />determination.<br />Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the<br />computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer<br />employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures,<br />including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing<br />or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on<br />and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of<br />computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<br />2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY:<br />If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night<br />differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm<br />and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a<br />Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not<br />overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).<br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to<br />employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working<br />with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of<br />sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black<br />powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or<br />explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance<br />operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<br />A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position<br />that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary<br />materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of<br />the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and<br />the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being<br />used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance,<br />explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These<br />differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the<br />agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br />If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this<br />contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the<br />state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne<br />by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with<br />the<br />following standards as compliance:<br />The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is<br />made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective<br />bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such<br />cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).<br />However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments,<br />and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or<br />commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by<br />the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of<br />the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance<br />costs.<br />The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<br />Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.<br />REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE<br />{Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}<br />Conformance Process:<br />The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee<br />which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such<br />unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.<br />Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<br />initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted<br />class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe<br />benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6<br />(C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF<br />1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.<br />The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<br />1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<br />2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<br />wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<br />authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to<br />the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of<br />employees<br />performs any contract work.<br />3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to<br />the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<br />Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<br />4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies,<br />or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process<br />the request.<br />5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.<br />6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<br />Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<br />paper.<br />When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to<br />insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />nformal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br /><br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI conducts programming in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and targeted areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, as well as in Karachi and southern Punjab.</p>
<p>In FATA/KP, the Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) program supports the Government of Pakistan's (GoP) development efforts to better integrate FATA into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan. PTI engages the Government of Pakistan's FATA Secretariat, Political Agents, as well as the FATA's tribes in participatory processes to identify community priorities and address some of the region's most immediate needs. The FS and its representative Agency structures, and the KP provincial and district government constitute the key interlocutors within the GoP for this program.</p>
<p>PTI works to counter violent extremism in targeted neighborhoods of Karachi and select districts of Southern Punjab that have been identified as Mission priorities. These activities fall under the wider Pakistan Expanded Regional Stabilization Initiative (PERSI), which aims to promote security and stability; counter violent extremism; and help build a foundation for longer-term economic, political and social development.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), manages an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities range across numerous sectors, including but not limited to irrigation and drinking water supply schemes, repairs to schools, roads, and flood walls, and agricultural terraces. Sociocultural and livelihood activities are also undertaken where they have the support of the community and will benefit the community as a whole. In addition, the program undertakes media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak) Regional Team and is based in Islamabad, Pakistan as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Pakistan country program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other bilateral donors, international organizations, and local government officials. The Country Representative will oversee a team of at least four USPSCs, several national staff, and a significant number of implementing partner staff in at least seven different locations across the country, including Islamabad, Peshawar, Karachi, and Lahore.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm. Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>I. GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. SOLICITATION NO.: SOL-OTI-16-000014</p>
<p>2. ISSUANCE DATE: January 26, 2016</p>
<p>3. CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: February 9, 2016, 5:00 pm Eastern Time</p>
<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Operations Advisor</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a "tandem" position that, depending on the qualifications of the candidate, can be filled at either the GS-11 ($51,811- $67,354 per annum) or GS-12 ($62,101- $80,731 per annum) equivalent level. Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value of the GS-11 or GS-12 level depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background. Salaries over and above the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated. Candidates who live outside the Washington, D.C. area will be considered for employment but no relocation expenses will be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Note: Applicants who submit an application for the GS-12 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as outlined in this solicitation and as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Committee, will not be considered for the GS-11 positions if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-11 level. Similarly, applicants who apply for the GS-11 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-12 position will not be considered for the higher graded position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-12 position. Applicants who are unsure of which grade level they meet the minimum qualifications for should submit separate applications for the GS-11 and the GS-12 positions. The application will be considered for the lower grade level if the applicant does not specify the grade level in the submission.</p>
<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year, with four one-year option periods.</p>
<p>The Personal Services Contractor hired under this contract will provide up to a maximum of 250 workdays of services on an annual basis. The specific projects, as well as dates, number of days and locations to be worked, will be determined by mutual agreement between the contract employee and his/her OTI supervisor according to the programmatic needs of OTI. There is no obligation by OTI to provide assignments for a minimum number of days, and the contractor is free to provide "blackout" dates during which he or she will not be available to accept assignments.</p>
<p>This recruitment is for an intermittent USPSC. Therefore, if a candidate is selected at the GS-11 grade, they do not have the opportunity for advancement to the GS-12 grade. However, once the candidate reaches the minimum qualifications of the GS-12 grade, he/she may apply for a GS-12 position if re-solicited by DCHA/OTI in the future. Extension of the contract is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>START DATE: Within 45 days of receiving notification that required security and medical clearance(s) have been obtained.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. SECURITY LEVEL REQUIRED: Secret</p>
<p>9. STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Operations Advisor is a key position in a busy office that responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. To achieve this, OTI relies on Operations Advisors who have the capacity to work well within a team environment, provide necessary support to a team, and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit. A common characteristic among OTI staff is that they are operationally-minded, enjoy working in a fast-paced environment, and seek innovative ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness of operations support and programs.</p>
<p>The Operations Advisor is experienced in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations for OTI programs, and provides services that require professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy and operational expertise in administrative support. This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation. While most of the work will be performed in Washington, there may be requirements for field travel. OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Operations Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Operations Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.<br /><br />Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Operations and Management Division (OMD) Chief or his/her designee, the Operations Advisor will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>At the GS-11 level:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide general administrative support for the supervisor and program-funded staff such as: scheduling and facilitating meetings, drafting meeting minutes, tracking and ensuring action items are followed up, scheduling and meeting logistics preparation, filing, correspondence control, and other administrative services as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare Acquisition and Assistance requests, security clearances/transfers, badge revalidation requests, Global Acquisition and Assistance System (GLAAS) requests, and other time-sensitive tasks;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the management and administration of procurement in support of OTI country program activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Respond to requests for information and tasks regarding OTI programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Fill ad hoc critical administrative/operations support staffing needs in Washington, DC and the field, in support of program funded staff and program operations, in areas such as administrative support (e.g. records management, correspondence control, logistics assistance, other general administrative support), personnel and human resources support (e.g. payroll, awards, drafting personnel memos, etc.), information and technology, and travel and finance support;</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm. Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.<br />Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />SEE ADDENDUM FOR FURTHER INFORMATION<br />[Contracting Officer shall insert the significant evaluation factors, such as<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;<br />(ii) price;<br />(iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304);<br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are __________ [Contracting Officer state, in accordance with FAR 15.304, the relative importance of all other evaluation factors, when combined, when compared to price.]<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p>52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.<br />Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Addendum)</p>
<p>B. BASIS OF AWARD-EVALUATION</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br />1. Award will be made to one (1) quoter deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements, and whose quote, judged by an overall assessment of the evaluation criteria and other considerations specified in this solicitation, represents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable with acceptable past performance.</p>
<p><br />2. Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors are not permitted. Unreasonably high/unrealistically low, unbalanced, inaccurate or incomplete price quotes may be the grounds for eliminating a quote from competition.</p>
<p>3. The Government will evaluate quoted prices for reasonableness using price analysis techniques. Quoted prices evaluated as unreasonable may be grounds for eliminating a quote from competition. The Government may use one or more price analysis techniques to evaluate price. Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced. Unreasonably high or low quoted prices may be grounds for eliminating a quote from competition either on the basis that the quoter does not understand the requirement or the quoter has made an unreasonable quote.</p>
<p><br />4. Award for All of the Work. The Government intends to award one (1) Firm Fixed Price contract as a result of this solicitation. Quotes received for less than the stated number of items listed in the Schedule may be considered ineligible for award. The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award one (1) contract without discussions with quoters. Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a cost or price, past performance and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>1. The quotes will be evaluated under three (3) evaluation factors: Technical Acceptability, Past Performance, and Price.<br /><br />Factor 1: Technical Acceptability<br />Factor 2: Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Price</p>
<p>2. Factor 1: Technical Quote</p>
<p>A technical quote is required from all quoters and shall be provided with the quote. The contents of the technical quote shall be directly aligned with the qualifications enumerated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Quoters shall use the PWS/Technical Quote Alignment Table provided in Appendix A or a similar format that directly aligns technical quotes with the measurable qualifications listed in the PWS.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p><br />Factor 1 -Technical. Technical capability of the product/services quoted to meet the Government's requirement aligned with the measurable qualifications in the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>Assigning Ratings. The Technical Acceptability Factor will be assigned one of the ratings defined below. Note: Failure to meet any one (1) of the specified technical factors will result in the quote being deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Technical Quote Acceptability<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>3. Factor 2 - Past Performance. The Past Performance evaluation will assess the quoter's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements as indicated by that quoter's record of past performance. Past Performance is assessed at the factor level after evaluating aspects of the quoter's recent past performance and focusing on performance that is relevant to the services being procured under this solicitation. Quoters are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the quoter's quote and data obtained from other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists. Three past performance references for similar services performed within the last three (3) years to either Government and/or private industry contracts are required to be submitted by the quoter. References shall include name(s) of Government agency(s) or commercial firm(s), customer Point of Contact (POC), telephone number, contract number and dollar amount. Past performance areas of evaluation include:</p>
<p>- Business Relations<br />- Quality of Service<br />- Schedule<br />- Customer Satisfaction</p>
<p>(a) Each quoter will receive a performance rating of "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" based on the Quoter's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the Contract requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Recency Assessment. An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>(c) Relevancy Assessment. To be relevant, the effort must be similar in nature of work, size, and complexity. The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine if it is the same or similar in nature of work, size, and complexity to the services/products being procured under this solicitation. Recent past performance is defined as not more than three (3) years from the RFP release date; relevant in terms of similar nature of work, size and complexity.</p>
<p>Assigning Ratings. The Past Performance Factor will be assigned one of the ratings defined below.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown.<br />Unacceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>(a) Note. In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably, or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote electronically furnished to the successful quoter within the time for <br />acceptance specified in the quote shall result in a binding contract <br />without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified <br />expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a <br />quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a <br />written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p><br />4. Factor 3 - Price. Price will not be scored or rated. Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more price analysis techniques. Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced.</p>
<p>(a) Unbalanced Pricing may be evaluated to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions.</p>
<p>Reasonableness. A price is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business.<br />Appendix A<br />PWS/Technical Quote Alignment Table</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>-Q1: In regards to [stated] request, according to the dates, you do NOT need any lodging on the night of the 17th, correct?</p>
<p>--ANSWER: That is not correct. The 25 double rooms would be needed the night of the 17 FEB. <br /><br />-Q2: [Deleted] Would you consider using two hotel venues if they were within walking distance of each other?</p>
<p>--ANSWER: We will consider hotels that are within walking distance of each other up to, but not exceeding 200 yards.</p>
<p>-Q3: We have the availability but we only have [#] double rooms. The remaining rooms would need to be king w/sofa beds. [Will] this automatically disqualifies us.</p>
<p>--ANSWER: Sofa beds are not acceptable substitutes and this offer will be considered technically unacceptable and will not be considered.<br /><br />-Q4: Please confirm that the total number of room nights required is 945 as calculated below<br /><br />Feb 5 - 90<br />Feb 6 - 105<br />Feb 7 - 105<br />Feb 8 - 105<br />Feb 9 - 25<br />Feb 10 - 25<br />Feb 11 - 25<br />Feb 12 - 25<br />Feb 13 - 25<br />Feb 14 - 25<br />Feb 15 - 25<br />Feb 16 - 25<br />Feb 17 - 25<br />Feb 18 - 105<br />Feb 19 - 105<br />Feb 20 - 105<br />Feb 21 - Check out</p>
<p>--ANSWER: The numbers of rooms are correct. Total is 945</p>
<p>-Q5: Regarding the 3 Star Rating criteria...Which travel rating system will you be using to determine if a property is 3 Star or not? Expedia and AAA are the primary directories, and both use a 5 point scale, but there are many differences. For example, the Fairfield Inn Wichita is rated 2 Stars by Expedia, but 3 Diamonds by AAA.</p>

However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or email usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http:// www.amc.army.mil/amc/commandcounsel.html.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction and Overview</strong></p>
<p>The intent of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to secure a contractor that will provide administrative services for the NIH Child Care Subsidy Program.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">2.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations to administer Agency's child care tuition assistance program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On November 12, 2001, President George W. Bush signed H.R. 2590 into Public Law 107-67 which includes permanent legislation authorizing the use of appropriated funds by executive agencies to provide child care services for Federal civilian employees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This legislation permits Federal agencies to administer a program to assist their lower income Federal employees with the costs of child care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will administer the program on behalf of the agency for the period of April 1, 2016 through December 31, 2021, with four (one year) extensions.</p>
<p>In FY2014, 142 NIH Federal Employees were served with 180 children to receive the tuition assistance from the NIH Child Care Subsidy program.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">3.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scope</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to assist lower income Federal employees with the cost of licensed child care services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tuition assistance can reduce the amount of tuition parents pay for child care by providing subsidies, directly to the licensed child care provider.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By providing assistance with child care cost, the employee can obtain quality dependable child care.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">4.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires a contractor to demonstrate it has the ability to effectively manage the NIH Child Care Subsidy program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In responding to this request, a contractor must demonstrate its ability to perform the following services:</p>

<p>The selection will be based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. One (1) A-E firm will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The contract is procured as 100% Small Business set aside.</p>
<p>The number one ranked firm will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The length of this contract is a maximum of 60 months and will not include optional time periods. The total capacity of this contract will not exceed $9,500,000. Task orders will be issued by negotiated firm fixed price task orders and will be negotiated and issued under the terms and conditions of this Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC). The Government shall be under no obligation to issue any particular number or types of orders and no liability to the contractor shall be incurred in the event that a certain number or types of orders are not issued; however, the Government guarantees a minimum ordering obligation of $35,000 for the basic contract via the first task order in concurrence with the IDC award.

The selected small business A-E firm will need to demonstrate capability to perform at least 51% of the contract work listed below in accordance with EP 715-1, Chapter 3-8c which can be found at: http://www.publications.usace.army.mil/Portals/76/Publications/EngineerPamph-1-7.pdf. In particular, in order to be awarded a small business contract the concern will perform at least 51 percent of the cost of the contract incurred from personnel with its own employees.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a minimum ordering obligation: NOT a minimum payment.

The following applies: "Any subcontractors and outside associates or consultants required by the Contractor (prime A-E firm) in connection with the services covered by the contract will be limited to individuals or firms that were specifically identified and agreed to during negotiations. The Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's written consent before making any substitution for these subcontractors, associates, or consultants." If a substitution is necessitated by illness, death, or termination of employment for whatever reason, the selected A-E firm shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 15 calendar days after the occurrence of any of these events and provide the following information to the Contracting Officer: required information for substitutions necessitated by illness, death, or termination of employment for whatever reason. The contractor shall provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitutions, complete resumes for the proposed substitutes, and any additional information requested by the Contracting Officer. Proposed substitutes should have comparable qualifications or better qualifications to those of the persons being replaced. The Contracting Officer will notify the contractor within 15 calendar days after receipt of all required information of the decision on substitutions. The prime A-E firm must obtain the contracting officer's consent to change any subcontractors that were identified during selection and negotiation. The contracting officer should refer the qualifications of any new subcontractor to the original selection board (to the extent that these individuals are available) for evaluation. Approval of these substitutions may result in a price credit to the Government.</p>
<p>Approximately award date: February 2016. The wages and benefits of services employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employee's office location (not of the location of the work).</p>

<DESC>RE: VA786-16-R-0078

Questions and Answers

Question 1: Is removal or blowing of trim grass also expected?
Answer: Removal of the grass edging / clippings is a requirement.

Question 2: Who is the incumbent? What was the previous award amount?
Answer: The incumbent is AvKARE, Inc. Total estimate contract value for base + 4 options was $615,000.00

Question 3: What is the approx. acreage of the national Cemetery that includes the flag stones to be maintained.
Answer: 135 acres

Question 4: What are the working hours and days permitted?
Answer: 8:00-4:30 Monday through Friday. Contractor may work on Saturday after receiving approval from the COR.   

Question 5: Do you provide transportation to utilize around the grounds during site visits? If not, are we permitted to bring our own? What types of vehicles are not permitted to transport around the site?
Answer: Transportation is not provided during a visit. Contractor may take a vehicle along paved roadways as they are located throughout the cemetery. No vehicles are permitted in individual burial sections.

Question 6: Are all of the flagstones in a row, grouped together, or are all 45000 scattered?
Answer: Flat markers are in various burial sections in rows.  

Question 7: What is the coverage area of these 45,000 flag stones?
Answer: See answer for question 6.

Question 8: After trimming the flagstones, is there a mandatory procedure required to finish the job (wiped off, brushed, blown, etc)? If so, please describe.
Answer: Yes, it is listed in the Statement Of Work (SOW). Please take the time to read it.  

Question 9: When is the approx. date of award announcement?
Answer: The Government cannot give a date. It can be between a 2 weeks to four month or even longer.

Question 10: Is a site map available displaying locations of flag stones
Answer: See cemetery map below.

Question 11: This bid is due next Monday, but since the snow storm that dropped 14 inches of snow at this cemetery, it's hard to get out there a look at the facility.  Is it possible to move the due date back a few days so our contractor gets out there?
Answer: No, the due date will stay the same. Contractors have had enough time to do a visit before the storm. However, a cemetery map and few pictures are included in this amendment to help get an idea of the site. Although site visit was recommended. See below.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Submit information requested above via email to 424.SCMS.AFMC.RFI.Responses@tinker.af.mil. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Technical questions regarding this sources sought may also be submitted to this email address. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In the subject line of the e-mail please include "B-2 Weapons Bay Door" so that individual responses can be sorted and responses quickly provided. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Phone calls will not be accepted.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Q&amp;A:<br /></strong><br />1. What are the quality requirements? <br />Answer: AS9100 or equivalent</span></p>
<p>2. Does the government have the tooling and or tooling specifications for the Weapons Bay Door? <br />Answer: The government has a portion of the tooling and we have a tooling list. We also have the complete tooling of the other three (3) doors that can be viewed by any contractor, but not taken or removed from Hill AFB. Viewing of tooling in Salt Lake City, UT possible during week of Aug 24-28. Notify 424.SCMS.AFMC.RFI.Responses@tinker.af.mil if interested. The 424SCMS, managing this project, does not own the partial tooling available on this particular item (CMXG at Hill AFB owns the tooling). As such, it is not clear if this tooling would be available as government furnished materiel.</p>
<p>3. To what extent must the Bay Door be tested? <br />Answer: It must pass Form Fit Function requirement, demonstrated by test fit on B-2 Aircraft.</p>
<p>4. The Contractor would like to know, since this is a prototype this is going to be produced, can they use cheaper material for prototype production to save time? Answer: Yes you may for preliminary FFF testing to reduce production risk, but the final accepted version must use approved original specified materials, and prove Form/Fit/Function at Edwards AFB.</p>
<p>5. How many planes are expected to be surveyed? <br />Answer: Government will do any surveying if necessary, and contractor involvement can be discussed. Additionally, loft data for aircraft surfaces is available.</p>
<p>6. Is the contractor allowed to repair the prototype door as necessary? <br />Answer: The prototype stage is considered past Critical Design Review (CDR). As such, a MRB action would need government approval. Depending on many factors, the flight suitability of a door would be assessed based on the MRB's against it.</p>
<p>7. Is there any potential for follow-on work? <br />Answer: Possibly. There are currently no spares, and the requirement is 1 to 3. A vendor successful with this project would be a future source of supply for this item should any future requirements arise.</p>
<p>8. Are there any Time Compliance Tech Orders (TCTO's) on the door? <br />Answer: none known.</p>
<p>9. Are rigging instructions available, which may show additional clearance tolerance for fit? <br />Answer: <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Rigging instructions will be released with full Tech Data Package prior to Request For Proposal</span></p>
<p>10. Dimensions? <br />Answer: 24ft long, 4ft wide. Tooling would push envelope out roughly a foot in each direction.</p>
<p>11. Will you release process specifications? <br />Answer: <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Most process specifications are proprietary to OEM and cannot be released</span></p>
<p>12. Are the doors a co-cured GR/Ep composite originally with auto-clave cure at 350F? What more can you share as to structural details and material?<br />Answer: <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Yes, Most all is BMS8-256, Type IV, Class 2, Style 3K-70-PW prepreg. 350 cure. Also random carbon fiber mat BMS8-302 grade 1. Core : BMS8-124, class 1, type 1 grade varies.<br /></span><br />13. In repair of such large structure, out-of-autoclave vacuum repairs is proposed where applicable. Is that an acceptable approach for the door?<br />Answer: No, we would not want to qualify another material for this application (Nuclear Capable Bomber).</p>
<p>14. The sources sought mentioned a cure temperature of up to 700F. Those cure temperatures are associated with polyimides or thermoplastics. A Peek resin graphite composite would be a reasonable approach for new construction but not to repair current production doors. I don't see a polyimide composite as needed here.<br />Answer: Up to 700F is listed in the qualification requirement, please list your qualifications and equipment in your RFI response so the USAF can assess capability to produce this item. Materials we expect to encounter are listed above.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve quality of life.
<p>The Civil Rights and Diversity Office (CRDO) promotes accessibility for employees and visitors. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, require the Government to provide reasonable accommodation to employees, applicants and visitors. Reasonable accommodation can include, but is not limited to, providing sign language services. Sign language services are provided so that manually communicating employees or visitors who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can participate equally in all facets of their employment or visit at NIST.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four deaf employees who require sign language services on a regular basis for meetings, trainings, and other events. Additionally, NIST hosts a variety of events (such as tours, colloquium talks, conferences and meetings) which are open to the public and may require sign language services. NIST plans to utilize Contractors to provide sign language services on an "as needed" basis to meet requirements, which may vary widely.</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to provide expressive and receptive sign language services for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

<DESC>Due to the closure of Federal offices in the Washington, DC, area based on weather conditions, GSA is extending the deadline for responses for solicitation 15DOLFPB.   Responses are due by 5:00 EST on the first business day the Government reopens.<br /><br />REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST<br />(REOI)<br />December 21, 2015<br />The General Services Administration (GSA) requests Expressions of Interest for a site to be used for the development of a new Department of Labor (DOL) Headquarters Building under a contemplated exchange. GSA is issuing this REOI as part of an exploratory process to determine if the United States Government will pursue the exchange of the existing Frances Perkins Building (FPB) and underlying land located at 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC in return for a new DOL Headquarters Building to be built by an exchange partner elsewhere within the District of Columbia (DC).  The exchange partner would be solicited in a subsequent two stage process: Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Request for Proposals (RFP). <br />This REOI is seeking to receive proposals for potential sites to accommodate the exchange for a new DOL Headquarters Building. As GSA explores the potential of an exchange transaction, GSA will consider (i) donated sites, (ii) sites to be sold to GSA through a no-cost, assignable purchase option (if exercised, allows for site acquisition at an agreed-upon price and is assignable to an exchange partner), or (iii) privately held sites on which the landowner wishes to retain exclusive development rights in the possible future exchange.  Donated sites are preferred.  Further description is provided below in the Developer Competition section. In addition to the sites submitted in response to this REOI, GSA will consider Federally-owned sites. <br />This site evaluation is being conducted pursuant to 40 U.S.C. &sect; 3304. GSA will review submitted sites against the minimum requirements set forth in this REOI and eliminate from further consideration those sites which do not meet, or are not readily capable of meeting, such requirements. GSA reserves the right to eliminate from consideration any remaining sites based on the additional criteria stated in this REOI, among others, and to select the site(s) (including sites other than those offered in response to this REOI) that GSA believes are the most advantageous to the Government, all factors considered, without regard to 41 U.S.C. &sect; 3101 et seq.
<p>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: <br />Delineated Area: Washington, DC<br />Size: Capacity for office and related space, between approximately 850 thousand rentable square feet (RSF) and approximately 1.4 million RSF, plus parking as required by local code, and accommodating physical requirements of Interagency Security Committee (ISC) Level III Security, applicable zoning, and other restrictions imposed by law or regulation.   <br />Access to Transportation: The closest boundary line of the site offered shall be within 2,640 walkable linear feet from a Metrorail station entrance.<br />Utilities: Site must be capable of providing adequate public utilities, including but not limited to two distinct feeds of electrical power or a reasonable equivalent, to ensure continuity in operations.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL CRITERIA: <br />The Government will select the site(s), if any, which meet the minimum requirements set forth above and which are considered to be most advantageous to the United States for development of a new DOL Headquarters Building.  Additional criteria that the Government will consider are listed below. <br />Site Development Flexibility: Among those sites that meet the minimum requirements stated above, preference will be given to:<br />&bull;	Larger sites;<br />&bull;	Those providing greater development flexibility (site shape and topography); and<br />&bull;	Sites whereby the owner is willing to subdivide so that GSA only obtains the amount of land needed for the project.</p>
<p>Proximity to Hazards: Sites that are within close proximity to continuous or infrequent hazards will be evaluated less favorably, and, depending on the nature and severity of the hazard, may be eliminated from consideration. Hazards include but are not limited to: <br />&bull;	Facilities involved in hazardous material generation, handling, storage, processing or disposal; <br />&bull;	Facilities presenting dangers that cannot reasonably be mitigated, including:<br />&#9675;	Biological research facilities; <br />&#9675;	Bulk gas facilities; and<br />&#9675;	Pharmaceutical production and research facilities.<br />&bull;	Railroads.</p>
<p>Environmental Impacts: Sites on which the development of a new DOL Headquarters Building would significantly disturb natural resources (e.g. wetlands) or would otherwise have significant impacts on the quality of the human and natural environment in ways that could not reasonably be mitigated will be evaluated less favorably, and, depending on the nature and severity of the impact(s), may be eliminated from further consideration. <br />Floodplain: Sites that are not within a 100- and 500-year floodplain are preferred.<br />Zoning, Land Use, and Schedule: Sites on which the development of a new DOL Headquarters Building would be contrary to current zoning or local land use plans, and/or which would not now be capable of obtaining site development permits, will be evaluated less favorably. <br />Acquisition and Development Cost: Sites that, in the Government's estimation, provide opportunities to lower overall costs (acquisition and development) for the Government are preferred.  <br />Historic Resource Impacts:  Sites on which the development of a new DOL Headquarters Building would significantly disturb historic or archeological resources (e.g. buildings, grave sites, etc.) or otherwise have significant impacts on adjacent historic properties or resources that could not reasonably be mitigated will be evaluated less favorably, and, depending on the nature and severity of the impact(s), may be eliminated from further consideration.<br />In addition to these additional criteria, the Government may consider other attributes of a site. No one criterion listed above is considered to be more important than any other, as a general matter. However, in the context of its evaluation of an individual site, with each site having unique attributes, the Government may treat some criteria as being more important than others.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF SITE AVAILABILITY: <br />Site offerors should be prepared to make their sites available via assignable purchase option or donation option through April 2018; as well, the Government would possess extension rights for an additional six-month period. As noted above, the Government reserves the right to obtain purchase option or donation option rights to one or more (or none) of the offered sites.</p>
<p>FUTURE DEVELOPER COMPETITION INVOLVING SITE(S) SOLICITED BY REOI: <br />If GSA decides to move forward with an exchange transaction, GSA anticipates that successful REOI proposed sites, in addition to Federally-owned sites (if appropriate), will be identified and specified in a future RFQ and RFP for the development of a new DOL Headquarters Building.  Entities submitting sites for consideration in response to this REOI would, if identified, be required to enter into a site donation or assignable purchase option agreement with GSA (privately held sites on which the landowner wishes to retain exclusive development rights must respond to this REOI but would not be required to enter into a purchase option agreement).</p>
<p>Exchange Transaction: Once the exchange partner has completed construction of a new DOL Headquarters Building upon the selected site and the Government has accepted the new DOL Headquarters Building, GSA will convey title for FPB to the exchange partner via quitclaim deed.</p>
<p>GSA OBLIGATION: <br />GSA reserves the right, at its sole discretion, without any liability, to accept or reject any or all of the REOI responses. This REOI shall not be construed in any manner to create an obligation on the part of GSA to enter into any agreement, nor to implement any of the actions contemplated herein, nor to serve as the basis for any claim whatsoever for reimbursement of costs for efforts expended in preparing a response or participating in the selection process.</p>
<p><br />SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: <br />Expressions of Interest may be submitted by site owners or their agents. In the case of an agent, the EOI must be accompanied by documentary evidence of the agent's authority to make a site offer on behalf of the owner. <br />EOIs should be submitted in letter form. <br />EOIs must provide, at a minimum, site address or location, contact information and e-mail address of the Owner of the Site and Owner's Representative, and include an accurate description and sketch of the site offered. EOIs should also provide as much of the following documentation as is available: <br />&bull;	Proof of ownership and ability to transfer the site to the Government; <br />&bull;	Any available documentation which demonstrates that the site meets the minimum requirements set forth above and which addresses the Additional Criteria set forth above; <br />&bull;	Any available documentation which describes any site or off-site infrastructure required for development of the site; <br />&bull;	Any available documentation of any existing or currently planned site or off-site infrastructure that may benefit development of the site;<br />&bull;	Available surveys,  topographic maps, or other documents that identify, describe, or provide concise, salient detail related to the site, including legal descriptions, title reports, easements, encumbrances and environmental conditions;<br />&bull;	Information on underground storage tanks or utilities locations; or any zoning, public use or land use approvals secured; and<br />&bull;	Statement of the consideration, if any, required by the owner for the conveyance of the site.</p>
<p>EOIs must be received on or before January 27, 2016 by 5:00 pm (EST). Electronic submissions are acceptable to email addresses stated below. If providing hard copy responses, please submit three copies to: <br /><br />Sara Towner, Asset Manager<br />Richard Sedwick, Asset Manager <br />General Services Administration <br />301 7th Street SW<br />Room 7600<br />Washington, DC 20407 <br /><br />sara.towner@gsa.gov <br />richard.sedwick@gsa.gov</p>

Deadling to Reply and Register: 12 February 2016<br /><br />The TSA invites interested Transportation Security Equipment (TSE) manufacturers, TSA employees, and potential TSA approved 3rd Party Test Organizations to attend this Industry Day. Due to building logistics and space, the TSA will only be able to accommodate a limited number of people from each organization. Advance registration is mandatory.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For consideration</span>, please review the attached document, "Third Party Testing RFI," and submit the following required information to ThirdPartyTesting@tsa.dhs.gov:<br /><br />1. Full Name<br />2. Title/Position<br />3. Organization/Company Name<br />4. Email Address<br />5. Phone Number<br />6. Current TSA Contractor (Yes/No)<br />7. Response to quesitons and information requested in the attached document, "Third Party Testing RFI."<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose of this Posting</span>: The purpose of this amendment to RFI HSTS04-14-OSC-3rd_Party_Testing_Model is to communicate information regarding the planned TSA Industry Day on 25 February 2016 to discuss the TSA 3rd Party Test Program and to solicit questions and capability statements from Industry.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose of the TSA 3rd Party Test Program</span>: The TSA supports the use of Third Party Testing (TPT) to gain efficiencies and cost savings in the acquisition Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) process as outlined in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acquisition Directive (AD) 102, DHS Management Directive (MD) 26-06, and this TSA Office of Security Capabilities (OSC) T&amp;E Policy. Failures during Qualification Testing (QT) and Operational Testing (OT) have resulted in an iterative cycle of test, fix, and re-test that extends acquisition timelines and drives up the cost of T&amp;E. TSA believes TPT is a key element in streamlining the acquisition process by ensuring system maturity before entering formal T&amp;E. The efficiencies gained by TPT can accelerate implementation schedules, reduce procurement delays, and reduce time-to-deploy. Overall, TSA expects TPT to decrease development and testing costs, and will allow TSA to better allocate constrained resources. The interim strategy will facilitate TSA's goal to standardize and streamline the T&amp;E processing using TPT.</p>

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)



Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA248-16-AP-2923 EMERGENCY CT Imaging tube

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 08, Bay Pines VA Healthcare System, Biomedical Engineering.  Request other than full and open competition, sole source procurement, due to inoperable CT scanner.  This request is of unusual and compelling urgency (FAR 6.302-2).  Purchase Request # 516-16-1-207-0015.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Procurement of (1) General Electric Computer Tomography Tube.  GE Medical Performix HD CT tube, part D3703T is required to repair down CT Scanner. This part is designed to work with our current system.
3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The X-Ray tube has to comply with the following:  The manufacturer of the tube must warranty the imaging tube. The Radiographic tube must pass the physicist inspection and FDA compliance criteria.
The tube must comply with radiation product standards 21 CFR Subchapter J.  A new contract is requested for this replacement part and the contract will be a firm fixed price for a commodity replacement part.

Housing, Model 5195800-5, DESC: Performix HD (Housing Maximum Potential Anode to Cathode: 140 KV, Housing Minimum Filtration 3.91mm, Aluminum equivalent at 070 KV)
Insert, Model: 5195900, DESC: Performix HD Insert (Tube Insert Maximum Potential Anode to Cathode: 140 KV, Tube Insert Minimum Filtration 0.04mm, and Aluminum equivalent at 070 KV)
Focal Spots: 2.0 x 1.2    1.6 x 1.2    1.0 x 0.7
The estimated cost of this part is $223,400.00, this product is not on contract; however, GE is providing the VA a 20% discount.  Delivery date is immediately as this is an unusual and compelling requirement; there is no period of performance for this request, it is a one-time purchase.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

       (  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): GE is the sole provider of this part. This part is a proprietary part that is supplied by General Electric Company - see supporting sole source documentation in file.  Only GE can provide, install and warrant this CT scanner to meet regulatory compliance mentioned in #3 above. The part is not interchangeable and no other company can provide this part and provide the installation and warranty.  A separate request was submitted for the labor portion of this requirement.  Without this machine, the Government could incur serious injury and impact patient care.  This machine is used on a daily basis for patient care. While the machine is out of operation it will require that a large number of emergent and scheduled veterans be re-scheduled (approximately 60 per day).  This machine is in operation during business hours and off tours and is used to obtain detailed diagnostic images for diagnosis and treatment planning.  Patients are currently being re-scheduled and will continue to be until this machine is back in operation. Re-scheduling patients for critical diagnostic testing will result in delay of diagnosis and/or treatment. Delay of diagnosis has the potential to be life threatening.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: This acquisition has unusual and compelling urgency that does not allow time to solicit for competition.  IAW FAR 5.202(a)(2) the Contracting Officer need not submit the notice to the Government wide Point of Entry (GPE) when the proposed contract actions is made under the conditions described in FAR 6.302-2 and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in FAR 5.203.  Competing this acquisition would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements, lead to increased costs of care, and adversely impact Veteran care and the fulfillment of the VA mission. 
There is a local VA contract # VA248-15-F-2800 which was based off of GEHC's master contract vehicle V797P-6019B, However, tube coverage is excluded from this contract but GE is providing the VA 20% parts and labor discount which has been applied for the tube purchase.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.   On 10/23/14, this part was previously purchased as an emergency under PO# A50043 in the amount of $237,650.00.  The current list price for this part is $279,000.00 for the general public.  GE is providing the VA a 20% discount of $55,800.00.  The cost will be $223,200.00 with $200 shipping and handling; a total cost of $223,400.00.  See documentation in file reflecting this discount.  In comparison with the independent government estimate of $279,000.00, a previous purchase of $237,650.00, and a 20% discount of $55,800.00, the price to be paid is considered fair and reasonable to the government.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  No other source is able to provide the warranty for tube to work with the General Electric CT Scanner.  Due to the emergent need for this equipment market research was limited to an examination of the acquisition history and experience with the marketplace under previous acquisitions for similar items.   

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None.


10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: General Electric Company, also see Section 6 above.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  No actions can be taken to overcome competition barriers in the future.  The breakdown of this machine was not anticipated.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
