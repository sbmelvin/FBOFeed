(a)	This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103.  An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed.  A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA.
(b)	An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following:
(1)	A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)	The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)	An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4)	A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.(c)	Voluntary Automatic Stay.  This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4).(1)	In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest.  This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay).  However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden.  This is known as an automatic stay override.<BR><BR>ACRONYM (MEANING): FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation), DFARS (DoD FAR supplement), CLIN (Contract Line Item Number), SUB-CLIN or SLIN (Contract Subline Item Number), OSHA (Occupational Safety Health Act), FOB (Free-on-Board), PCO (Procuring Contracting Officer), CFR (Code of Federal Regulations), LSA (Labor Surplus Area), SF (Standard Form), DD/DOD (Department of Defense), NSP (Not Separately)Priced<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a cost reimbursement type contract to conduct testing for National HIV Incidence Surveillance and other CDC HIV surveillance activities using the BED assay and remnant samples (serum, plasma, dried fluid spots) from newly diagnosed individuals from sites funded for HIV incidence surveillance and report the results to these sites.  The Serologic Testing Algorithm for Recent HIV Seroconversion (STARHS) is the currently accepted method used for the estimation of HIV incidence.  With STARHS, confirmed HIV-positive samples are analyzed using the Calypte HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA (BED assay).  The BED assay is a quantitative assay that indirectly measures the proportion of HIV-1 specific IgG antibodies with respect to total IgG.  Samples from recently infected patients have a lower proportion of HIV-1 specific IgG antibodies than samples from patients with long term infection and therefore can be classified as recently infected using this assay.   Quantitative values from this assay are evaluated against control values and cut-off points to estimate the likelihood that the sample being tested is from a newly infected individual or someone with a long term infection.  Results from the BED assay are used with clinical, demographic, and testing history information to estimate the incidence of a population.
The major tasks to be completed under this contract include, 1) National Incidence Surveillance Testing/BED Assay, 2) Shipping Requirements, 3) Data Management and 4) STARHS Lab Briefings.  The CDC anticipates a period of performance from, January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, with four additional option years.  The estimated volume of tests per year is 150,000.

This is not a Request for Proposal.  The intention of this notice is to notify potential offerors that Solicitation No. 2008-N-09691 will be available for download on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov on or before November 13, 2007.  This will be a full and open competition.  Additionally, all amendments and responses to questions will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date.  All questions must be submitted in writing to Dyad Searcy at dsearcy@cdc.gov or Betty Vannoy at bbv9@cdc.gov.  All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) website at www.ccr.gov.  No telephone calls will be accepted.

Additionally, the SLA will be reviewed to determine that support around software issues will be reviewed in a timely manner and that a 24 hour a day help desk will be made available.  Furthermore, the issue escalation path that is implemented when issues are not resolved by the initial support representative should be outlined in the SLA.  Lastly, a description of the type of software upgrades, and support for the upgrades, should be defined within the SLA.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM/OPS/SIO).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for the acquisition of the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition ETL software product and support identified in Paragraph (3). 
Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6 (4) for limited source acquisition and approval, because of upcoming administration changes and to support the increase in congressional inquiries it is critical that the acquisition of the Informatica PowerCenter ETL tool be procured using the cited authority. The Departments Bureau of Information Resource Management requires the purchase of licenses for the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition and first year support that are listed in paragraph (3).  These licenses and support are required to design, develop, and implement a pilot for the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) by November 2008.  The EDW will be used to support questions and analysis that occur during an administration change and congressional inquiries.  This J&A supports the purchase of the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition on the basis of a Brand name only acquisition.
The Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) is one of eight management reform initiatives reported to the Secretary that the U.S. Department of State (DoS) is currently executing.  The goal of EDW is to greatly diminish many of the challenges currently impacting the use of the Departments historical data, and to provide greater analytical ability to the end users.  This will first be accomplished by giving authorized users of the system desktop access to near real-time data.  This data will be pulled from various source systems and used to populate the EDW through an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool.  The data warehouse will also have a Business Intelligence (BI) component integrated with it.  The BI component will present capability to run standard and ad hoc reports and will also provide tools to perform cross-cutting data analysis along with embedded user-friendly display ability.  By providing these capabilities, the EDW will turn raw data into shared knowledge thereby promoting information sharing throughout the Department.  This knowledge will in turn enhance the decision-making process, boost operating efficiency, and lower operating costs.  In essence EDW will increase the value of the Departments data set and allow the Department to have a forward and backward view of their data so that they may know what has happened, what is happening, and what is likely to happen.<BR><BR>The ETL products and support listed below are required by IRM/OPS/SIO and are developed by Informatica.  These ETL products/support are available for purchase from Informatica and Informatica resellers.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the software/support identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Government's existing investment.  The Informatica ETL tool is essential for meeting the aggressive schedule of this critical Department initiative.  A/LM/AQM intends to compete IRMs requirements among Informatica resellers possessing a GSA FSS No. 70 contract. The Enterprise Data Warehouse will be used to address queries and conduct analysis to support executive level decisions and to support congressional inquiries.  An ETL tool is the primary means of continuously populating data into a data warehouse.  The Informatica tool is required to perform concurrent data integration and metadata management, to ensure data integrity and to achieve an automated, reusable process implementation for the EDW project. The Informatica tool facilitates rapid processing of vast amounts of data, which is inherently needed to support the kinds of analysis required to assist executive decisions and congressional inquiries.  This speed is supported by targeting multiple data structures simultaneously without having to stage any data.  The Informatica tool will conduct self auditing analysis by capturing metrics around the data integration effort to ensure proper performance is achieved and alert administrators of potential data inconsistencies.  Additionally, the tool has an integrated ability to profile data.  This capability is useful to determine the datas quality and suitability for usage, which is vital to the success of a project dependent on multiple, disparate source systems.  In short the Informatica ETL tool will provide EDW the capability to pull data from disparate source systems in a compressed format with assured delivery of data, assured integrity of data, and checkpoint/restart capability, for recovery of transmissions in the event of a network drop.  These attributes come together to produce an ETL tool which is both flexible and possesses robust reliability.  The requirement will be competed among Informatica resellers that have GSA Schedule No. 70 contracts.  GSA has already determined the schedule prices to be fair and reasonable.  However, the Government intends to competitively award a delivery order to the offeror that represents the overall the best value to the Department.  Although the requirement is justified on a limited source basis, AQM will post the requirement on FedBid and will include the brand name justification with the posting as required by FAR 8.405-6(d).  The requirement will be competed on FedBid among Federal Supply Schedule No. 70 contractors in compliance with FAR 8.405-6 and AQM Memorandum 08-05.  The Department is prepared to provide the RFQ to additional firms that request copies (reference FAR 8.405-2(c)(4)).<BR><BR>

This requirement will be set aside 100% to small business.  The NAICS code is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, and the small business size standard is $6.5 million [average annual revenue for three preceding fiscal years].  Award of a firm-fixed-price purchase order, using simplified acquisition procedures is anticipated.  The award will be made based on Best Value to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors set forth herein and in the Request for Quotation (RFQ) package.  The Request for Quotation package (RFQ) will only be available on the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

The goal of this requirement is to encourage and support the expansion of hazard, disaster and emergency management related education in colleges and universities across the United States so that in the future more emergency management and related personnel in government and the private sector will come to the job not only with a college education, but with a course of study, if not a degree, in emergency management as well.  Because emergency management is a multidisciplinary field of study, this helps contribute to the professionalization of emergency management and the expansion of emergency management knowledge and principles into other professions and disciplines as well--all of which contributes to building disaster resistant and resilient communities of tomorrow.  Toward that end, EMI, located at the NETC in Emmitsburg, Maryland, developed the Higher Education Project, the primary purpose of which is to encourage and support the development of hazard, disaster and emergency management bachelor and graduate degree programs within United States colleges and universities.  Each Emergency Management Higher Education Project course shall be developed within the philosophical context of (1) building disaster resistant and resilient communities, and (2) seeking balance between the technocratic and the social vulnerability reduction approaches to emergency management.  Please refer to the Higher Education Project Slide Presentation at the following website address:  http://training.fema.gov/EMIweb/edu/highedbrief_course2.ppt.  A listing of the completed Emergency Management Higher Education Project courses can be found at the following website: http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/highedbief_course2ppt.  Additional information concerning the Emergency Management Higher Education Project can be accessed at:  http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/aem_courses.htm.  
Offerors shall be able to provide demonstration of the following:  1) academic inter-disciplinary course development team work; 2) international course development team work representing more than a single country; 3) experience teaching hazard, disaster and/or emergency management-related courses at the upper division or graduate college level at an accredited university within the past five years and be able to provide course titles, dates, and  copies of most relevant course syllabi; 4) knowledge of and background in the subject matter of “comprehensive emergency management; 5) background, credentials and expertise in the subject matter of international and comparative emergency management, preferably by the provision of a copy of a college course syllabus for an emergency management course taught by the offeror or by one of the proposed course development team members that relates to comparative emergency management from an international perspective; 6) familiarity with emergency management-related social science literature; 7) familiarity with international emergency management literature; 8) familiarity with emergency management-related governmental material, particularly that of a doctrinal nature.  9) Additionally, at least one principal course development team member shall provide evidence of holding a doctoral degree from an accredited college or university.  The offeror shall submit resumes with their quotation package for all individuals identified as “Key Personnel,” in order to clearly demonstrate that all qualifications set forth are met.  For example, some of the tasks of the contractor will be to develop a work plan, attend course development/focus group meetings at NETC, develop a course outline/syllabus, develop draft course material, attend course-review comment meetings at EMI/NETC, and attend the annual Higher Education Project Summer Conference and give a presentation(s), develop final course materials, etc.

<DESC>The Military Sealift Command (MSC) vessels are built to commercial standards and comply with the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and United States Coast Guard (USCG) regulations.   MSC also voluntarily complies with International Maritime Organization (IMO) and Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) rules and regulations.   In order to operate with the combatant fleet, MSC is required to use military unique data with unique software requirements not found with commercial navigation software.  MSC must ensure that any military features added to commercial navigation software do not violate established certifications.

In September 2007, MSC issued Military Sealift Command’s Guidance for Implementing and Testing of ECDIS with DNC® and TOD0 Capabilities, which established guidelines to meet MSC’s military and commercial navigation requirements. ECDIS currently accesses and displays Electronic Nautical Charts (ENC) and Raster Nautical Charts (RNC); MSC requires the added capability to read and display Digital Nautical Charts (DNC®) developed by the National Geospatial Agency (NGA). These charts contain additional data layers which MSC needs to access the Tactical Ocean Data Level 0 (TOD0). Part of MSC’s self certification process will require coordinating NGA data with commercial industry.

Currently, the NGA paper chart is MSC’s primary means to navigate its vessels.  NGA is in the process of phasing out support for the paper chart in favor of digital chart data starting no later than 2012.   Before then, MSC must have certified ECDIS compatible with DNC® products onboard.

The purpose of this Contract is to provide Contractor services to:  (1) Assist MSC in updating its Military Sealift Command’s Guidance for Implementing and Testing of ECDIS with DNC® and TOD0 Capabilities; (2) Provide ECDIS subject matter expert (SME) service to verify independent lab findings concerning Maker’s ECDIS; and (3) Provide ECDIS SME service to assist MSC’s side-by-side comparison testing of Maker’s ECDIS with required DNC and TOD0 capabilities.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) National Highway, Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) intend to award an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC), on a Time and Materials contract for a base period of two (2) years. The contract will also include a provision by which up to one (1) option three years period can be exercised resulting in total of possible period of performance of five (5) years. The National Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (an operating administration within the United States Department of Transportation) is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on the highways resulting from vehicle crashes. In support of this mission NHTSA is requiring the services for the effort entitled, Engineering Special Studies for New Car Assessment Program. New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) provides national leadership in planning, developing and initiating new and innovative consumer information programs that are based upon laboratory or full-scale crash tests.  These programs generate market forces, which encourage the production of improved passenger motor vehicles and/or occupant protection systems.  The NCAP and Crashworthiness Standards conduct a variety of research projects, demonstration programs, technical analyses, and engineering studies to assess the crashworthiness of new vehicles to fulfill the provision of Title II of the Motor Vehicle Information Cost Savings Act.  The engineering test procedures, crash data, and test results also are used to develop and disseminate information mandated by the Consumer Information Regulations of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.  The primary objective of the Group is to develop and coordinate in the dissemination of consumer information on any aspect of motor vehicle and occupant protection systems that may induce market forces to enhance occupant protection through the production of improved motor vehicles and associated equipment. NCAP formulates, develops, and executes studies to achieve agency requirements in the areas of human impact tolerance, human crash kinematics, and anthropomorphic dummy development.  The studies include interpreting the results of vehicle crashes to assess the risk of human injury.  The studies are used for (1) defining, developing, and implementing improvement in existing programs of consumer information and (2) realistically assessing the results of new vehicle crashes for consumer information. NCAP often conduct special studies for analyzing vehicle testing results. This is an 8(a) Competitive Set-aside requirement. NAICS code for this contract is 541380. An Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC), on a Time and Materials contract is planned for a base period of two years and one three year option.

(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

This requirement is for a 980 nm Band Tunable Diode Laser System to be used in experiments such as transmission/reflection spectroscopy of nanophotonic devices and resonant optical pumping of nanocavity-based light emitters at room and cryogenic temperatures.

Sole source determination is due to the necessity for compatibility with existing experimental systems.  In particular, for each of the different types of experiments planned, a large amount of customized control software has already been written, for use with NIST’s two existing New Focus lasers in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology laboratory, and would be readily applicable to the New Focus 980 nm Band Tunable Diode Laser System.  This customized control software not only calibrates and controls the different functions of this laser system, but also integrates it with other pieces of existing lab equipment including a waveform generator, motorized stages, photodetectors, optical attenuator, and sample temperature controller.

New Focus is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required 980 nm Band Tunable Diode Laser System.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, anticipates awarding a contract on a sole source basis to Panavision Federal Systems, Woodland Hills, CA for Research and Development to develop and build a 360 degree module for use with the Digital Periscope.   The basic requirement will require the design and fabrication of the imaging module pressure housing along with associated data.  Options will be included for a 360 degree Imaging Module Transition study, an imaging module and imaging sensor module design, imaging sensor Engineering Development Model, inboard processing unit, production drawings, provisioned item ordering and 1,000 hours of engineering services.  The contract type will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee.  The sole source is based on the fact that the Optical Sensor Package (Digital Periscope) is a preproduction unit for which neither a sufficient data package exists nor has a physical configuration audit been performed.  Award to another vendor would represent a duplication of costs as the new vendor would have to become familiarized with the system which would also cause unacceptable delays to the program.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and past performance. NOTE - The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.

The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters. The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:robin.turner@us.army.mil">US Army C-E LCMC Acquisition Center - DAAB07</a>
<DESC>The Government has identified a requirement to increase the ceiling on the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) Omnibus Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J101 to meet backorders and support increased demands as a result of Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) operations and other Army modernization efforts. This notice attempts to identify additional sources to meet current and future SINCGARS sustainment requirements. Contract number W15P7T-05-D-J101 was awarded on a competitive basis to ITT Industries, Aerospace-Communications Division (ITT), 1919 W. Cook Road, Ft Wayne, IN 46801 on November 30, 2004 for the manufacture and support of the ITT designed SINCGARS assemblies, including the Integrated Communications Security(ICOM)RT-1523, RT-1523B, RT-1476, RT-1477, RT-1478, System Improvement Program (SIP) RT-1523C, and Advanced System Improvement Program (ASIP) RT-1523E and RT-1478D, and ASIP-Enhanced RT-1523F. This contract is a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and Time and Material (T&M), Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract, with a five-year base period and two option years to produce SINCGARS, spare parts and sustainment support for the ITT family of SINCGARS products. Also included in this contract are the following ancillary devices that were independently researched and developed by ITT: ASIP-E 19 PIN Connector, GPS Fan-Out Box, Vehicle Remote Control Unit (VRCU) and Cables, Single ASIP Radio Mount (SARM) and Cables, Radio Based Combat Identification (RBCI) Responder Box, Control Display Unit (CDU) and Ethernet Fan-Out Box. ITT has Data Rights on items that were independently researched and developed. Any interested source must negotiate directly with ITT on Technical Data Rights issue on the above mentioned ancillaries. The Government is seeking interest from alternate sources capable of producing a build to print version of these configurations at a rate of up to 6000 equivalent Line Replacement Units (LRUs) (including spare parts and CCAs) per month. The contract includes configuration management responsibility (including obsolescence management) to address major obsolescence issues. To maximize the flexibility in modernization of the older assemblies, configuration control of the SINCGARS configurations under this contract has been reassigned to ITT to support this ongoing redesign effort resulting in new drawings that have not been delivered to the Government. Consequently, the Technical Data Package (TDP) which supports the manufacture of these assemblies has become unstable because the redesigns are ongoing and drawings are not yet delivered to the Government for these redesigned configurations. The Government is also interested in identifying sources with the capability to produce the radio and associated LRUs, spare parts and CCAs over the next 3-6 years. Interested sources must demonstrate that they have the plant capacity to meet monthly demands of up to 6000 equivalent SINCGARS LRUs (including spare parts and CCAs) per month. In addition, interested sources must possess the necessary security clearance to process Communications Security COMSEC equipment.  Deliveries must begin within 9 months of contract award to include completion of First Article Testing (FAT) to satisfy Army fielding and sustainment requirements. FAT will be required for all sources other than ITT, that are interested in the proposed action. Contract Number W15P7T-05-J101 also includes requirements for services, to include the repair of all hardware and ancillary items listed under the contract and hardware procured under the contract. Engineering support services are required to be performed throughout the length of the contract for efforts related to supportability analysis, development, manufacturing, testing and fielding of SINCGARS items delivered under this contract. Selected engineering tasks include, but are not limited to: 1) The evaluation of the maintenance concept to ensure the most cost-effective sparing options are maintained on elected models or assemblies affected by obsolete components 2) The update of field maintenance procedures as required, to include organizational level as well as the AN-GRM-122 software and technical documentation support, are required to be performed. Contractor Field Service Representative (CFSR) support of all system installations, training and field support of all SINCGARS equipment is also required to be performed under this contract. SINCGARS training support services and material are required to be provided. The CFSR support will include the responsibility to conduct in-country site surveys, installation kit development and spare parts packages and engineering support to resolve field identified technical issues with the SINCGARS radio system. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to meet the Governments requirements.  Sources capable of providing these items in accordance with the Governments requirements, to include the required delivery schedule, shall respond in writing.  The response shall include a short introductory description (unclassified) outlining a viable approach that meets the above needs and should address production capabilities.  Responses from interested sources shall address their capability to act as a single provider for the SINCGARS, spares, and services. Submit one electronic copy of the submission to the following: Project Manager, Command Post, ATTN: SFAE-C3T-CP-TRC (James Bowden), Bldg 427, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703, Telephone: 732-427-3062, Email: James.Bowden@us.army.mil<BR>Submit one electronic copy of the submission to the following: CECOM LCMC, Logistics and Readiness Center, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-COM-R-SR (Denis Chan), Building 1202W, Fort Monmouth, NJ  07703, Telephone: 732-532-1894, <BR>Email: Denis.Chan@us.army.mil<BR>

The scanner should be able to accurately scan the aircraft even if the aircraft is moving.  The scanner can not be unwieldy to operate and should not weigh more then 10lbs.  Accuracy of the scanner should be at least 60 microns and the resolution should be at least 80 microns.  Z Corporation's scanner is the only one we have found that will accomplish the above requirements.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO) intends to issue a sole source contract to ThermoFisher Scientific, Franklin, MA for the following equipment:Miran SapphlRe XL Ambient Air Analyzer with gas filter and particulate filter; 85 each #205B-XL1A3N; 85 each #CR015BE Miran Sapphire Accessories Kit includes carrying case, leak detection proble, spare particulate and zero gas filter; 85 each #CALIBRATION Standard MultiComponent Calibration Set #5, Indoor Air Quality; 85 each #CALIBRATION Standard MultiComponent Calibration Set #7, Medical Air International; 85 CALIBRATION Standard MultiComponent Calibration Set #7, Medical Air International; and 85 each #TRAIN-IH Training at VA Facilities by local Regional Sales Manager upon request of VA.This notice of intent is not a request for quotes.  The Government intends to acquire the supplies via FAR 6.302-1 and FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit descriptive literature containing sufficient literature to the extent necessary to allow the government to determine the technical acceptability of specification.  The aforementioned information should be submitted in writing to the Contract Specialist (email: Priscilla.Lee@va.gov) not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on July 1, 2008.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.    Please referenc RFQ #VA-101-08-RQ-0211.  The NAICS #334516.  Below is the Justification for the aforementioned supplies, in accordance with FAR 11.105:JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOROTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONUpon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.1.  Identification of AgencyDepartment of Veterans AffairsOffice of Acquisition and LogisticsCenter for Acquisition Innovation (049A1)810 Vermont Avenue, NWWashington, DC  204202.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  This justification and approval set for the facts and requests approval for the issuance of a sole source contract with ThermoFisher Scientific, Franklin, MA for MIRAN SapphIRe XL Ambient Air Analyzers to support medical facilities within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  The proposed cost is $1,663,535.3.  Description of Service and Supplies:  The equipment has follows:Miran SapphlRe XL Ambient Air Analyzer with gas filter and particulate filter; 85 each #205B-XL1A3N; 85 each #CR015BE Miran Sapphire Accessories Kit includes carrying case, leak detection proble, spare particulate and zero gas filter; 85 each #CALIBRATION Standard MultiComponent Calibration Set #5, Indoor Air Quality; 85 each #CALIBRATION Standard MultiComponent Calibration Set #7, Medical Air International; 85 CALIBRATION Standard MultiComponent Calibration Set #7, Medical Air International; and 85 each #TRAIN-IH Training at VA Facilities by local Regional Sales Manager upon request of VA.4.   Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority for this justification is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) or 41 U.S.C. c(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.5.  Justification Rationale:  The Miran SapphIRe filter-based, single beam spectrophotometer (IRs) is the sole source provider of multi-gas detection system with the ability to measure at user selectable wavelengths in single or multiple gas mode while compensating for interfering gases with similar absorption bandwidths.   It is a unique product in that it is field portable weighing less than 40 pounds, whereas traditional infrared spectrophotometers of this capability are bench mounted for stationary use in the lab at 3-5X the weight with full computer screens.  It provides a charcoal clean air purge cycle to ensure accurate readings, whereas traditional IRs models require single canister gases and manual calculation of calibration curves.  The MIRAN IR unit has the calibration curves on pre-loaded internal software and simultaneously checks pathway beam length performance during the analysis process to verify that the software curve is valid.  Most importantly, the MIRAN IR has 120 library-based chemical calibration curves pre-loaded to allow selection of the chemical to be analyzed by the user.  These 120 standard library curves are not available in any IR unit on the market, much less a field portable one.  Additionally, Foxboro recognizes the special needs of healthcare facilities by including all the major U.S. and European Anesthetic gases combinations as an option.  This anesthetic gas option is also not available as a standard package by any other manufacturer.  These rather complex attributes packaged in a touch screen user interface have resulted in wide acceptance by Federal Agencies, including DOD.  The MIRAN IR Foxboro units are already widely selected by VHA facilities to meet on station response.  Most Networks only have 1-2 MIRAN IRs.  Laboratory equipment trade and manufacturer publications (mostly Rimbach Publications) have been reviewed, and lab and pollution control equipment websites and websearches have been conducted to find comparable IR units.  No other IR product incorporates such a large internal library, with adjustable beampath capability and a user touch screen in a portable field package at any price.   Portable IRs are available , but possess  limited chemical (<10) analysis and are typically small benchtop systems specific to the analysis of single chemical class, such as biofuels, fatty acids, halogenated alkanes or cyclical compounds.

<DESC><p>SCOPE This purpose of this notice is to identify interested sources to provide in-theater depot maintenance services to support United States Air Force A/OA-10 aircraft stationed at Osan Air Base, Republic of South Korea. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This notice is for planning purposes only and DOES NOT COMMIT the U.S. Government to provide compensation for information requested nor does it commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This notice does not provide any direction nor does it change any contractual obligations to sources currently under contract with the U.S. Government. BACKGROUND The A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II, commonly known as the Warthog, is a highly maneuverable, low-altitude, close air support aircraft built around a 30mm seven-barrel Gatling gun and powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofans. The aircraft is designed for combat survivability and can employ a variety of free-fall and precision guided munitions as well as a full compliment of self-protection chaff and flares. The first production Fairchild Republic A-10A was delivered to the United States Air Force (USAF) in October 1975 and achieved Initial Operating Capability in 1977. In 2006, the USAF began modifying A-10A aircraft with the Precision Engagement (PE) modification which adds upgraded cockpit displays, digital stores management, advanced targeting pod integration, and other improvements. Precision engagement modified aircraft are designated as the A-10C. The A-10C has surpassed its original design life but has been tasked to remain in service with the USAF until at least 2028. However, as result of the 30+ years of operational service, the aircraft is yielding to the effects of fatigue and corrosion. To extend the life of the aircraft, the USAF has implemented depot-level maintenance inspection/repair programs for the wing, fuselage, nacelle, and other fatigue-critical components. These inspection/repair programs are designated as the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and Scheduled Structure Inspection (SSI). SLEP is a once-per aircraft procedure that began in Fiscal Year 2002 (FY02) and is scheduled to be completed on all aircraft by Fiscal Year 2013 (FY13). Once an aircraft has undergone SLEP, an SSI will be accomplished every 2000 flying hours or 1600 landings, or 8 years (whichever comes first) until the end of its service life. Since 1993, the United States Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) has operated a squadron of approximately 27 A/OA-10 aircraft. These aircraft are operated, maintained, and employed by the 51st Fighter Wing, Osan Air Base, Republic of South Korea. To reduce the costs and issues associated with ferrying aircraft from Osan AB to the Continental United States for depot level maintenance, PACAF requested the establishment of a contractor depot facility within the Korean theater. In 2001, the A/OA-10 System Program Office (SPO) awarded a contract through fair and open competition to establish an in-theater depot facility to support PACAF A-10 aircraft. The period of performance on the existing depot-services contract is nearing conclusion. As required by U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations, the A/OA-10 SPO is pursuing a follow-on competition to select a contractor to perform the requested in-theater depot services beginning in FY10. CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS The A/OA-10 System Program Office is seeking interested sources to provide in-theater depot maintenance support for the 27 PACAF A/OA-10 aircraft. Depot-level maintenance is defined as that materiel maintenance requiring major overhaul or a complete rebuilding of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and end items, including the manufacture of parts, modifications, testing, and reclamation as required. Depot maintenance serves to support lower categories of maintenance by providing technical assistance and performing that maintenance beyond the responsibility or capability of lower levels of maintenance. The following work activities are to be accomplished: 1. A-10 ground support operations for receiving/delivery of aircraft to depot facility 2. Installation of Precision Engagement avionics/electrical aircraft modification package 3. SSI aircraft inspection, repair, and structural modification procedures 4. Aircraft Paint and Plastic Media Blast 5. Non-Destructive Inspections (NDI) 6. Accomplishment of battle/crash damage repair on a negotiated drop-in basis 7. Deployment of Contract Field Teams to aircraft field locations to accomplish depot-level tasks and provide on-site technical support 8. Installation of future aircraft modifications as required In order to be considered as a candidate for selection, interested sources must be able to meet the following requirements: 1. Prior experience with aircraft major overhaul and repair 2. Knowledge of and proficiency with USAF Technical Order and Time Compliant Technical Order system and requirements 3. Supply all facilities, equipment, and manpower necessary to accomplish all work activities. Note: Some equipment specific to the A/OA-10 may be available to the contractor as U.S. Government Furnished Equipment. Facility must be located within the Korean theater and be capable of receiving and supporting A-10 flight operations. 4. Access to a skilled and qualified work force 5. In-house manufacturing capability for basic aircraft components including manufacturing engineering support The U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and CFT deployments as necessary. Installation of the Precision Engagement modification for all 27 aircraft is forecasted to be accomplished over the first two years of the contract period (FY10-11). INSRUCTIONS FOR INTERESTED SOURCES This Sources Sought synopsis is an invitation for all qualified sources for this requirement to identify themselves to the U.S. government as a potential offeror. All interested sources should submit a response to the U.S. Government Contracting Officer listed below. Please include a statement of interest and a brief company profile highlighting relevant experience and qualifications relating to the capability to accomplish the specified work requirements. Please also note any prior experience with U.S. Government contracts. Please limit responses to no more than 10 pages. Any information provided to the U.S. government in response to this synopsis is for planning purposes only and will not be used as a selection consideration factor in this or any other U.S. Government contract competition. Should the U.S. Government elect to pursue the subject requirement, an official Request for Proposal will be released at a later date. Please direct all questions related to this synopsis to the U.S. Government points of contact.</p>

<DESC>The objective of this notice is to seek out small business contractors interested in providing the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) with technical assistance support services.  FTA's Office of Planning and Environment (TPE) assesses New Starts projects to verify that requirements for eligibility for New Starts funding have been met.  Reviews of past New Starts projects have documented that rider ship forecasts have frequently varied significantly from rider ship experienced after those projects have been opened for service.  In addition, increasing numbers of project sponsors are seeking New Starts funding, yet cannot demonstrate that adequate information has been produced during alternative analysis.  To support development of accurate information on New Starts projects seeking New Starts funding, the Office of Planning and Environment provides guidance, technical assistance and oversight of the planning and project development process.  The results of this procurement will help ensure that alternatives analyses produce reliable information that can support the identification of projects that merit federal investment.  FTA anticipates that the required services will focus on the following functional areas: 

1 - Collection of data on transit rider ship patterns, 
2 - Urban travel models, 
3 - Forecasting for New Starts and Small Starts projects, and 
4 - Refinement of methods for FTA oversight of New / Small Starts travel forecasts.  

All small business concerns that are able to provide the services describe above, are encouraged to forward their capability statement (not to exceed 5 pages) to the point of contact (POC) identified below.  Capability statements are to be submitted electronically, no later than July 14, 2008 to the Primary Point of Contact (POC) below.  All sources will be added to the solicitation mailing list and notified when the agency synopsizes the requirement in the Government Point of Entry (GPE).  The GPE may be accessed via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

For the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI), the mission of the RDAs would be comprised of the technologies, operational concepts, infrastructure and other detection and interdiction strategies that focus on how to detect, interdict, deter and contain nuclear and radiological threats for the Southeast Asia geographic region.  The definition of a RDA would consider the individual and collective detection and interdiction capabilities of the countries in the region, and the needs or “gaps” in present capabilities.  The concept would also consider the security, political, technological, and economic context in which such capabilities exist, or potentially could exist.  This includes, for example, the willingness of countries in the region to work together on such issues and the willingness of the countries to work with the United States or work with multilateral organizations to address such problems. The research and analysis would address two task areas: Strategic Analysis of National and Regional Factors for Southeast Asia and Regional Architectures for Southeast Asia. 

Under the Strategic Analysis of National and Regional Factor for Southeast Asia, the goal would be to examine and characterize the Southeast Asia region with respect to all issues of significant relevance to regional detection architecture strategies. The examination of issues such as planned and existing civil and military nuclear programs, border protection capabilities, general cooperative security behavior of the country (regionally and internationally), and commercial trade analysis and commercial transport pathways transiting the region. 

Under the Regional Architecture for Southeast Asia, the goal would be to perform research and analysis on options for strengthening detection capabilities as part of a regional architecture for Southeast Asia.   

In response to this RFI, the Government requests that responders address the following tasks as it relates to this RFI: 1). Strategic Analysis of National and Regional Factors for Southeast Asia; and 2) Regional Architectures for Southeast Asia. In addition the responder is asked to answer the following questions: A). Does your organization have internationally recognized expertise on SE Asia? B). Does your organization have nationally or internationally recognized expertise on nuclear detection architecture? C). Does your organization have internationally recognized expertise on terrorism: D). Does your organization have individuals in all categories 1-3 that currently old clearances at the TOP SECRET/SPECIAL COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION (TS/SCI) level and E).How do you characterize your organization’s ability to provide security experts with the ability to read and speak languages relevant to this study? 

Responses should be no more than ten (10) pages, Microsoft Office 2000 compatible, and should be sent to Tracy.C.Miller@dhs.gov.  Hard copy responses will not be accepted. .  

Note that this is not a formal request for proposal. DHS will not reimburse any preparation costs associated with responses to this RFI.  The Government is not committed to issuing a Request For Proposal (RFP) as a result of responses received for this RFI. It is the Respondent’s responsibility to periodically revisit this website for notices, amendments, updates, questions, answers and changes to the posted information.  No classified submissions will be accepted.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SPADAC Inc, 7921 Jones Branch Dr. Ste. 600, Mc Lean, VA  22102-3399 for Annual EarthWhere Server Maintenance.
This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition:
The USGS Rocky Mountain Geographic Science Center in Denver, Colorado seeks to obtain maintenance, upgrades, and support on EarthWhere software produced by SPADAC Inc in McLean, VA, USA.
The RMGSC conducts geographic and cartographic research and applications, and systems development in support of the program goals of the Geography Discipline of the USGS. RMGSC works on various projects which include the application of GIS and remote sensing to natural resource management and environmental issues, and the development and implementation of new techniques and procedures associated with digital and graphic geospatial data.
Over many years, the USGS RMGSC (formerly known as the Research, Technology, and Applications (RTA) branch of the USGS Rocky Mountain Mapping Center (RMMC)) has acquired licenses to use EarthWhere software tools from SPADAC Inc. to support the geospatial data processing requirements of projects. SPADAC Inc. continues to enhance these tools and resolve technical problems (bug fixes). Many of these enhancements and bug fixes are required to support changes in data formats and processes of the continually evolving GIS and Mapping community. 
The USGS and RMGSC is a leader in the GIS and Mapping community which requires us to work with these new data formats and processes which requires us to stay up to date on enhancements, bug fixes, and technical support on the EarthWhere software tools produced by SPADAC Inc Software tools developed by SPADAC Inc. are proprietary to and copyrighted by SPADAC Inc. 
To the best of our knowledge, there are no other companies that have access to the source code to these software tools that would allow another company to enhance the software, provide bug fixes, and provide detailed technical support for EarthWhere software tools.
Firms that believe they can provide the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS). Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 511210 which is $23.0 Million per year averaged over last 3 years.

Established in 1985, the NHP has also conducted numerous assessments and provided tools and technical assistance to State and local agencies in developing hurricane evacuation plans.<BR><BR>Traditionally, the main product produced by the NHP is the Hurricane Evacuation Study (HES), which provides national standard, state-of-the-art the decision-making tools for protecting the public when a hurricane threatens an area.  These studies help State and local communities establish evacuation plans by completing a suite of analyses that include:<BR><BR>Hazards Analysis: quantifying wind speeds, surge heights that could be produced by a combination of hurricane intensities, approach speeds, approach directions, and tracks that have a reasonable meteorological probability of occurrence within the study area;<BR><BR>Vulnerability Analysis:  identifying the areas, populations, and facilities that are potentially vulnerable to flooding and extraordinary wind damage under various hurricane threats;<BR><BR>Behavioral Analysis: setting out assumptions about how the population in and around the vulnerable area will react to threats of hurricanes;<BR><BR>Shelter Analysis: identifying shelter locations, capacities, demand, and vulnerability; and <BR><BR>Transportation Analysis: calculates evacuation times for a range of hurricane threats, helps define the evacuation roadway network and evaluates traffic control measures or highway improvements needed for improved traffic flow.<BR><BR>The culmination of the above five analyses through the HES is the development of a Technical Data Report that includes a description of the methodology used for each analysis and the data and maps produced.<BR><BR>With the exception of the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) into the HES process, for the past decade the general methodology for conducting HESs and the studys end products has not significantly changed.<BR><BR>HESs have been conducted and/or are currently being completed for every coastal state from Texas to Maine and the Caribbean and Pacific Islands that are threatened by Tropical Storms and Hurricanes. Some of these HESs are 2nd and 3rd generation studies that have been updated due new and improved storm surge data, significant population changes, or by lessons learned from actual hurricane evacuations. As a result, the need to conduct the comprehensive HES analyses will continue in the future; however, the need to modernize and improve the analyses methodologies and products needs to be addressed. Additionally, the NHP has recognized the need through years of coordination with state and local emergency managers and the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA) that additional data and products are needed to assist the development of hurricane evacuation plans.<BR>  <BR>Consequently, the NHP is proposing to augment the HES process with an expanded Comprehensive Hurricane Emergency Management Studies (CHEMS) suite of products and services.  The CHEMS would include the suite of HES analyses and products, but would also offer data and products associated with Community Storm Impact; Business Mitigation & Recovery Analysis; Re-Entry Analysis; Communication Assessment; Technology Analysis; and Training. The purpose would be to allow the state and local emergency managers to choose those products and tools that are best suited to meet their evacuation planning needs, and to incorporate federal level support from outside the traditional HES process as well.<BR><BR>The objective of this request for information (RFI) is to seek information from organizations with proven emergency management expertise that would support and define the methodologies and products associated with the CHEMS process.<BR><BR>The premise of this RFI is that there are emergency management experts outside of the traditional National Hurricane Program (NHP)/HES community who have ideas and potential tools for assisting in the NHP mission and expanding its service offerings. The purpose of this RFI is to create a forum for introducing and/or proposing new ideas and suggestions for contracted services to be funded by and provided through the NHP. The NHP is, therefore, requesting information to support the development of the CHEMS and its associated analyses and tools. If applicable, the following information being requested includes (but is not limited to) the following:<BR><BR>1. Storm Surge GIS Mapping Tools. <BR>2. Vulnerability Assessment Tools.<BR>3. Hurricane Evacuation Zones Development Tools.<BR>4. Transportation Analysis Models and Tools.<BR>5. Community Storm Impact Tools and Analyses (i.e., Societal Analysis, Special Consideration Area Analysis, etc&)<BR>6. Business Mitigation & Recovery Tools and Analyses (i.e., Debris Management Planning, Post Storm Redevelopment Planning, Long-term Sheltering Planning Tools).<BR>7. Re-Entry Tools and Analyses (i.e., Decision Making and Transportation Tools).<BR>8. Communication Assessment Tools and Analyses, including public information and emergency communication strategy development.  <BR>9. Evacuation Technology Tools and Analyses (i.e., GIS Applications Assessment / Enhanced Decision Assistance Tools).<BR>10. Evacuation Training Tools for HURREVAC, SLOSH, HAZUS MH, and general hurricane planning and preparedness.<BR>11. Comprehensive Interactive Planning Tool for CHEMS Data and Products<BR><BR>It is not the NHPs intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as 'Proprietary' or 'Confidential' will be kept confidential.<BR><BR>Additionally, this is not a Request for Proposal nor is it to be construed to be a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses to this notice will not be considered offers, nor will any award be made as a result of this notice. <BR><BR>The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. The Government is conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources, particularly, firmscapable of providing the services listed above.<BR><BR>Responses should include their current business structures: (a) name of Company-include contact persons name, company address, telephone numbers (voice and fax), e-mail address and (b) Company size (i.e. large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc).   <BR><BR>Also, the submission should include proposed methodologies and products to support the development of the CHEMS process and any other analyses or products that would assist the future development of the NHP for the above listed target areas. A description of the companies past performance in hurricane preparedness planning and the use of any proposed tools or methodologies to support hurricane preparedness planning.<BR><BR>Responses to this announcement will not be returned. All submissions will be reviewed based on recent and past performance regarding hurricane preparedness planning and relevancy of the tools and methodologies proposed to support the development and implementation of a Comprehensive Hurricane Evacuation Management Study. Based on the Governments review, the Government may contact respondents for additional information or ask the respondent to present or demonstrate their proposed methodologies or capabilities to the NHP.<BR><BR>The Technical POC for this RFI is Mr. Michael Schuster: 410-962-8160 or michael.j.schuster@usace.army.mil

<DESC>There is no solicitation.  The United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services Division in Portland, OR has plans to award using other than full and open competition to Praqua Supplies Limited of Nanaimo BC for the following items:  1) Vaki Micro counter single channel system which counts fish from 0.2 g up to 200 g in size with 4 inch pipe fittings; and 2) Vaki Optional Size Estimation software package. This equipment safely moves fish exclusively in water without exposing them to air (in some cases, extreme weather), thus reducing diseases causing stress on the fish and also reducing repetitive lifting and bending by staff to inventory and move large numbers of fish.  The single channel counter has the capacity to count up to 500,000 - 1g fish per hour and uses a line scanning video camera to detect and count fish.  It also records an image of each fish that has been counted making later count verification possible.  Praqua is the sole North American supplier of the Vaki fish counter.  The Service intends to award Sole Source to Praqua Supplies limited.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and is not a request for competitive proposals.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition<br /></span></strong>The Susquehanna River Basin Commission is the one and only responsible source that is able to coordinate the Susquehanna Flood Forecast and Warning System due to their role in the Susquehanna River Basin as defined by Congress. The Susquehanna's River is the nation's sixteenth largest river as well as the largest river lying entirely in the United States that flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The Susquehanna and its hundreds of tributaries drain 27,510 square miles, an area nearly the size of South Carolina, spread over parts of the states of New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. The river meanders 444 miles from its origin at Otesgo Lake near Cooperstown, NY, until it empties into the Chesapeake Bay at Havre de Grace, MD. The river basin borders the major population centers of the east coast, and although relatively undeveloped, has experienced problems of water pollution and over usage. Because the Susquehanna River flows through three states and is classified as a navigable waterway by the federal government, there are state, regional, and national interests involved. SRBC is uniquely qualified because the need for coordinated efforts and establishing a management system to oversee the use of the water and related natural resources of the Susquehanna. These needs led to the drafting of the Susquehanna River Basin Compact, which was signed into law on December 24, 1970. The Compact, as adopted by the Congress of the United States, and the legislatures of New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, provides the mechanism to guide the conservation, development, and administration of the water resources of the vast river basin. The Compact established the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC) as the agency to coordinate the water resource efforts of the three states and the federal government. Each member is represented by a commissioner who serves as the spokesperson for the government that he or she represents. In the case of the federal government, the commissioner and his alternate are appointed by the President of the United States. For the three states the commissioners are the governors or their designees. The governors also appoint alternate commissioners. Under the leadership of an Executive Director, technical, administrative, and clerical personnel support the daily operations of the Commission. The mission of the SRBC, which is defined in the Compact, is to enhance welfare through comprehensive planning, water supply allocation, and management of the water resources of the Susquehanna River Basin. To accomplish this mission, the SRBC works to reduce damages caused by floods, provide for the reasonable and sustained development and use of surface and ground water for municipal, agricultural, recreational, commercial, and industrial purposes; protect and restore fisheries, wetlands, and aquatic habitat; protect water quality and in stream uses; and ensure future availability of flows to the Chesapeake Bay. The SRBC is uniquely qualified to carry out this mission. As a federal-interstate compact commission, its focus is defined by the natural boundaries of the river basin rather than the political boundaries of the member states. As such, the SRBC serves as a forum to provide coordinated management, promote communication among the members, and resolve water resource issues and controversies within the basin.</p>

Accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  

            This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are being 
requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The North 
American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541611.  This is a small 
business set-aside.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS RESTRICTED AND ONLY

Performance Work Statement (PWS):
.


--BEGINNING OF THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT-----

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT for P.R. NB200000-8-04411

1. Background Information: 
For the past six months, the NIST, Office of the US Measurement System (USMS) has focused on creating a solid foundation for the next phase in the USMS' evolution. One of the major thrusts has been related to communications planning and implementation with key stakeholder audiences. 

A basic communications strategy, plan and implementation schedule have been created, and initial or pilot mechanisms launched (e.g., talks, presentations, visual aids, key conversation strategies, etc.). With early interest and support for USMS established, the need now is to deepen, expand and sustain this momentum. 

2. Purpose: 
The purpose of this requirement is to support the NIST USMS Chief in efforts to continue work related to the communications strategy, planning, tactics and execution. 
Deepen and sustain the core message for the USMS office with key internal stakeholders (e.g., National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) Operating Unit (OU) Directors and the NIST Director's Office). Help align and narrow the information gap 
between senior management and the bench end users (e.g., via OU Deputy Directors, Division Chiefs and Group Leaders).  Create written and online mechanisms to reinforce and expand communications with all key audiences.  Continue to strengthen the NIST,
USMS ability to effectively communicate with a range of audiences, both internal and outside of NIST. Ensure that the NIST, USMS beta/hub reflects and is aligned with the USMS communications strategy and "offline" tactics. 

3. Contractor Requirements Specific Tasks: 

Task 1: USMS Strategic Plan Review and Input

         Review and provide input as needed on The NIST USMS strategic plan, to ensure that the communications plan fulfills the goal of reaching all internal audiences and begins to permeate NIST strategic planning practices. USMS goals are provided on http://usms.nist.gov; and the USMS strategic plan will be provided separately.  Each section will be reviewed for strategic communications needs, and the communications plan will be adjusted accordingly.  At least three of the recommended communications mechanisms will be tested as part of a defined pilot program.  This program will be defined by NIST following the strategic plan review. Provide written and verbal input 
as needed. 


Task 2. Written Communications Mechanisms 

Create and help launch written communications mechanisms, including a monthly 
e-newsletter, website content and end-user support toolkit.  These communications mechanisms will be assessed in relation to the strategic plan above E-newsletter: Provide
support services to create appropriate editorial tone, content, topics and format to meet goals; develop implementation strategy and opt-in automation system; coordinate with other USMS team members as needed for successful launch; provide monthly topic ideas, content and coordination to ensure sustained implementation. Website content: work closely with website development team to provide written content (e.g., case studies, stories, compelling WIIFM-oriented descriptions, etc.); work with USMS beta hub usability team on testing and integration between "offline" communications efforts and supporting online mechanisms. End-user Toolkit: work closely with Toolkit development team as needed to help create structure and content; provide suggestions on packaging to support and enhance the Toolkit's impact and effectiveness. 


Task 3: Verbal/spoken Communications Mechanisms 
	 
Refresh and refine (i.e., update) talks and presentations to leverage 
messaging developed as part of this effort. Presentation/talk coaching to help prepare 
for and practice new or revised approaches. This work will include practice sessions with members of the USMS team, followed by feedback and suggestions for refinement of the 
presentation.  This process will continue until there is mutual agreement on the quality and relevancy of the presentation.  A minimum of two general presentations, for two audience types (e.g. internal technical; external semi-technical) will be developed in this fashion. Input an guidance on visual aids (e.g., slide decks, figures, images) that support and reinforce the overall communications strategy.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protestor’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address:  Commandant (CG-913), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC.   20593, Telephone:  (209) 372-3692 or Fax:  (202) 475-3904.

Proposals must be received by close of business Wednesday, 09 July 2008.  Proposals received after the date and time specified will not be considered.  Offerors may email their proposals to jay.s.mcreynolds@uscg.mil.  Contractors may contact either contact below for further details of this Solicitation.

The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

Offerors may propose early or a staggered delivery schedule for large quantity orders based on plant capacity which will be considered during the quote evaluation. The offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 7 July 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 3 July 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer potential offeror questions which were due no later than June 23, 2008 at 2:00 PM EST.  Also, we revised the Statement of Work language, in the Scope and Key Personnel Element sections
 
Question #1: Will all EMC personnel be required to be expert level engineers?

Answer #1:   No. 
 
Question #2: What track of expert level engineers will they be trained?

Answer #2:  The track required to perform the work detailed in the SOW.  In this SOW, DMX and Centera implementations are described, so EMC Proven Professional Experts in "Storage Administration" or "Technology Architect" tracks must be available.
 
The second paragraph in the Scope was changed to read “Successful completion of these tasks will require direct access to EMC engineering and existing IRS configuration information held by EMC, and full unfettered access to IRS facilities and personnel.”

The Key Personnel Element was changed to read “It is the reasoned judgment of IRS Tier II Enterprise Operations that only EMC personnel can provide the required level of expertise, experience with the IRS, and knowledge and understanding of IRS integration and operational standards”.






Please submit your proposal electronically by Wednesday, July 2, 2008 at 12:00 NOON.  Any questions regarding this RFQ shall be submitted by email NTL Monday, June 23, 2008 at 2:00 PM EST to Craig.M.James@irs.gov.

<DESC>T-1A Trainer Aircraft Modification to Add Combat Systems Officer (CSO) Training Capability
This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements to modify twenty-one T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include an on-board Combat Systems Officer training station for use by United States Air Force (USAF) personnel and generate the associated technical data. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined.

2.	If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your companys capability in meeting these requirements.  Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)
3.	Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research.  Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

<DESC><p>QUESTION</p>
<p>Part I - The Schedule, Section B, states that the PDPs can be ordered in various colors. According to Drawing 8642400, when the PDPs are specified as green, the deadfront panels are painted with semi-gloss enamel. However, when tan is specified, the 25KW PDP is to be painted with lusterless CARC paint (section 5.6 of the drawing). There is a cost difference between semi-gloss enamel and CARC. Is there some way of getting at least an estimate of how many 25KW PDPs will be ordered with each color?</p>
<p>ANSWER</p>
<p>The government will waive the requirement for CARC paint for the 25 kW PDP, paragraph 5.6 on drawing 8642400.</p>

An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties are invited to call the WR Air Logistics Center Ombudsman, Mr. Alan Mathis, WRALC/XP, at (478) 926-2183.

<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>If you are capable of conducting the below research and development please send a statement of capabilities to Nathan Johnson (Nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov).  This statement should include past performance or some other measureable criteria to establish that your firm is capable of accomplishing this work.  The responses received from this sources sought notice will assist in determining the type of competition for this acquisition.  All companies are encouraged to reply.

The overall objective is for the contractor to work with the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA – APHIS) to develop a sensitive, specific assay capable of detecting all Avian Influenza viruses in a mixed sample, including known and unknown strains (i.e., virus drift that would be flagged for follow-up).  Once a technology is established for detecting Avian Influenza other viruses (e.g., Foot and Mouth Disease) will be added.

The Technology should be capable of:
Detection of many types of infectious micro-organisms* with a single platform; 
detection of a wide range of infectious micro-organisms (e.g., entire virus genus or family) from any host species with a limited set of reagents - information leading to reagent design may be provided by user or public domain; 

Identification of known, unknown, deliberately altered, divergent, or mutated agents within the 'wide range of agents' cited above; 

Detection of multiple microorganisms simultaneously in a mixed sample (prefer clinical sample); 

Reliable, sensitive, specific, high-throughput (100s-1000/day, with automation if necessary) sample assays in 12 hours or less;

Routinely operable by technician (e.g., BS level) with results able to interpretation by PhD level.

If the assay is marketed in a form that would be subject to Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) licensure, that it be licensed or judged to be at the applicable CVB standard.

CVB Mobile lab or field deployment capability is not required.

Contractor shall be capable of collaboration with APHIS scientists to fit the technology to specific APHIS applications as shown by:

Providing contract testing service or technology deployment to a well-equipped and staffed laboratory; 

Past performance (peer-reviewed publication preferred) of use of technique with influenza (preferably type A, and avian influenza);

Past performance of  successfully working with federal labs to develop applications


A complete copy of the specficaions should be available the week of 23 June 2008.  This will be 100% set-aside for small businesses.

It is believed that only NORCAT through CCC can provide thiseffort, as there is no other source that can provide the combined terrestrial andextra-terrestrial mining technology development and testing background in conjunctionwith a recognized lunar geotechnical regolith simulant.  This effort will complement andextend ongoing work at GRC and other NASA centers to evaluate lunar mining concepts andimplements using other lunar regolith simulants developed with support from NASA.The due date for responses is extended to Friday, June 27, 2008.

<DESC>Please be advised of the following:

1.  The closing date for the RFP is July 9, 2008 at 3:00 p.m., E.S.T.  

2.  Section M.3 is incorporated into the RFP as follows:

M.3  BASIS FOR AWARD (BEST VALUE)

The Government shall make award to the responsible offeror whose proposal is affordable to the Government as well as realistic in price, and is evaluated as the best overall value to the Government, price, past performance and technical factors considered. 

A cost realism analysis will be performed for all technically acceptable offerors.  Contract award will be based on the combined evaluations of Contractor's Technical Proposal (Oral Presentation), Past Performance, and Price.  The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to provide the "best value" to the Government, which may not necessarily be the proposals offering the lowest cost nor receiving the highest technical score.  It should be noted that cost is not a numerically weighted factor.  Although non-cost factors are significantly more important than cost, cost is an important factor and should be considered when preparing responsive offers (proposals).  The importance of cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the remaining evaluation factors.
 
 When the offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical, past performance and other no-cost factors (if any), or when cost is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government, cost may become the determining factor for award.  In summary, cost/no-cost trade offs will be made, and the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other if governed only by the tests of rationality and consistency with the established factors.
 
 Prospective contractors are advised that the selection of a contractor for contract award is to be made, after a careful evaluation of the offers (proposals) received, by a panel of specialists chosen by DOL/OJC.  Each panelist will evaluate the proposals for technical acceptability using a range of scores assigned to each factor.  The factors are presented in the order of emphasis that they will receive (i.e., Factor A has the greatest weight, Factor B the second greatest weight, etc.).  The scores will then be averaged to select a contractor for award on the basis of their proposal being the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

There has been an update to the requirement as well as newinformation regarding issuance of the solicitation.  Therefore, offerors are notifiedthat the following changes are made:  The requirement is modified to include thestructural skid on which the Chemical Steam Generators are mounted, piping and componentssuch as valves and instrumentation, and control system hardware. Due to the nature of thechanges being made and the length of time since this requirement was first advertised,the initial description is replaced in its entirety with the following:---------------------------------------------------The NASA/SSC Acquisition Management Office intends to issue a Best Value Request forProposal (RFP) for the project entitled Fabrication, inspection, testing, and deliveryof Chemical Steam Generators for A-3 Altitude Test Stand to be delivered to the John C.Stennis Space Center, Mississippi.  The work to be performed under this requirementconsists of providing all labor, equipment, and materials necessary for the fabrication,inspection, and testing of Chemical Steam Generators, the structural skid on which theChemical Steam Generators are mounted, piping and components such as valves andinstrumentation, as well as control system hardware as stated in the referencedspecification with delivery to Stennis Space Center Building 2204.   Twenty-seven (27)Chemical Steam Generators will be fabricated by the contractor awarded. Nine structuralskids will be fabricated with three Chemical Steam Generators mounted into each skid.Piping and component shall include all inlet and interconnecting propellant lines as wellas the steam outlet pipe.The CSGs required are a design that was produced for White Sands Test Facility in the1960s that is a proven design.  The most similar component to these CSGs is a smallregeneratively cooled rocket combustion chamber or gas generator.  The concept isbasically a small combustion chamber similar to a rocket engine combustion chamber thatburns isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and oxygen with a water diluent to produce the steam.

The government is looking for companies that have the following capabilities:

1.  A facility (or a dedicated area within a facility), or the willingness to obtain a facility in the Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina Area to serve as the CRIF.  The Government estimate of work and office space required is approximately 30,000 sq ft.  Facility must be able to store classified materiel at the secret level.

2.  Proof of the ability to handle classified material (via current or previous DD254 accreditation)
3.  A copy of their ISO 9001 accreditation/certification.  If the vendor is submitting a certification other than ISO 9001, then they should provide a discussion about that certification.  
4.  A copy Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) for services or development Level III Certification
5.  Recent and relevant (within the last 2 years) contract experience with the government or commercial customers in these areas to include description of the work performed.

This notification does not constitute an invitation to bid nor a formal request for proposal, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Failure to respond to this preliminary RFP notification will lead to exclusion from the formal RPF solicitation.   The Government will send the solicitation to only vendors that respond to this preliminary RFP notification in the manner specified herein and that are able to receive the solicitation, security factors considered.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide the following clarifications regarding subject BAA:
Question 1.  Do you anticipate multiple awards for this BAA or a single award?
Response 1.   Multiple awards are expected up to the $1.6M ceiling identified in the BAA. 
Question 2.  Is your intent that "F" [reference PIP] is for academic institutions only, or for industry to collaborate with academic institutions?
Response 2.  The intent for "F" is primarily to stimulate academic institutions in their advanced technology investigations, but a proposal for industry to collaborate with the academic institution(s) would be considered as well.  Ideally, industry would already be integrated as part of an academic consortia for this approach to be favorably evaluated, just due to the timeframe it would take to establish these relationships from scratch.
Question 3.  On "H" [reference PIP], could you provide more information / specs on the IMS DM or and/or provide a contact?
Response 3.  No any additional information/specs on the IMS DM, other than what was included in the announcement, is available.
