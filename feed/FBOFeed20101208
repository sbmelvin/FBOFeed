<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Division of Oral Health, contemplate a sole source award to Quantitative Health Research, Inc., P.O. Box 41439, Memphis, TN 38174. The contractor shall provide expert consultation services in the field of tooth decayTo provide trainings, demonstrations, and help desk service to current and potential SEALS users, amend software to meet specific needs of individual states. Determine best way to help large states aggregate SEALS data across programs for state reports, and develop a cost-effectiveness calculator for community water fluoridation. Delivering sealants in the most efficient manner increases effectiveness and reduces costs, thus increasing the number of children that can be reached by school sealant programs. However, at present, there is little evidence on what constitutes "best practices" for school sealant programs. Collecting data to document best practices can be expensive and many programs do not have analytic capacity. In addition, "best practices" may vary due to environmental conditions beyond a local program's control such as dental practice acts that dictate to what extent dental auxiliaries can be used to deliver sealants and the size of the population served by the program.
<p>To assist states in delivering sealants in school settings more efficiently, the CDC Division of Oral Health retained the services of Dr. Kari Jones to develop SEALS software (Sealant Efficiency Assessment for Locals and States). This evaluation software package helps individual communities and states measure the effectiveness and efficiency of their school sealant programs. SEALS software automates the capture, storage, and analysis of data on oral health status, types and numbers of services delivered, program costs, and logistics (eg, personnel, equipment, materials, travel). Reports generated by SEALS can be used to benchmark programs, evaluate current practices, and justify the program to policy makers. Examples of summary and performance measures generated by SEALS are cost per child sealed, averted caries estimated from baseline caries attack rates and sealant retention data, and number of children sealed per chair hour. SEALS output has been useful to the states. The information provided by SEALS has been used by state programs to document the effectiveness of school sealant programs to policy makers and to more efficiently allocate their funding dollars to maximize health impact. In addition, Seal America includes SEALS software in their guidance for data collection and analysis for school sealant programs. Thus the use of SEALS helps DOH meet one of CDC's major goals - achieving healthy communities and schools.</p>
<p>Interested contractor's shall possess sound scientific background and the ability to effectively communicate with CDC staff, partner groups, and in professional meetings, interpersonal skills are required to develop and maintain productive relationships and ensure completion of projects within a multi-disciplinary team. The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 41 U.S.C. 253-a (a) (1), in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541690, Other Management Consulting Services, with a Standard Business Size of $7.0M.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. The Governemt will issue only one solicitation to the Quantitative Health Research, Inc. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet the requirements stated above, are encouraged to submit their capabilities/qualification statement to the Attention of Matthew Ellington, by email at mce8@cdc.gov. Facsimile proposals are not authorized. If responding by email, the subject line must include the following language "Proposal for RFQ#2011-Q-13091.

The Holter monitors are medical devices that record continuous activity of the heart.  In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), 24-hour Holter monitors were implemented to measure the variability in time between successive normal beats, or the normal-to-normal intervals.  The NIA uses this information to provide objective assessments of autonomic nervous system function, known as heart rate variability.  The contractor will scan the 825 24-hour Holter monitors, manually review and edit HRV analyses, report clinical findings and deliver written and electronic copies of the reports.  Period of performance is one year.  The contractor provides a proprietary system, DelMar Impresario, which will provide data and reports to meet the needs of the BLSA.  This system will provide consistent data collection and reporting during the BLSA.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) in Seattle, WA has a requirement for a vessel to conduct the biennial Continental Slope Bottom Trawl Survey of groundfish resources in the Gulf of Alaska and Eastern Bering Sea.
<p>The established survey design is to conduct biennial surveys of continental slope groundfish in the eastern Bering Sea (even years) alternating with biennial surveys of continental slope groundfish surveys in the Gulf of Alaska (odd years). The AFSC Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) Division Groundfish Assessment Program conducts these comprehensive trawl surveys and related research in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off Alaska as required to monitor and describe trends in abundance and distribution of commercially and ecologically valuable groundfish populations.</p>
<p>Objective: Provide a safe, comfortable, and capable platform to conduct the surveys in order to continue to deliver (1) annual quantitative estimates of groundfish and crab biomass and population size and (2) biological, habitat, oceanographic, and acoustic data for the continental slope areas of the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. This work is conducted under the auspices of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006, first enacted in 1979 and amended in 1996, as needed for setting annual harvest levels for groundfish and crab stocks. Project performance is determined by the successful completion of each charter necessary for generation of up-to-date estimates of biomass, abundance, distribution, and population structure of groundfish and crab populations for inclusion in stock assessment analyses and ecosystem forecast model efforts.</p>
<p>The base year survey period consists of the base charter of 50 days beginning on or about May 18th, 2011 with the potential of up to an additional 40 optional charter days occurring immediately after the base charter. The survey period of the option year of the charter consists of the base charter of 50 days begins on or about June 1, 2012, with the potential of up to an additional 40 optional charter days occurring immediately after the base charter.</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, transportation and services necessary to perform these services.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to provide a vessel which can accommodate a scientific party of up to six (6).</p>
<p>The resulting contract will have a base survey period beginning on or about May 18, 2011 lasting up to 90 days. There is one (1) option period for the resulting contract.</p>
<p>Vessel must be able to tow the standard research trawl, a 27.4/36.5 m (90/120 ft) Poly Nor'Eastern trawl, with either rubber bobbin roller gear at a continuous speed of 5.6 km/hr (3 kts) for the 2011 Gulf of Alaska survey or the same trawl rigged with mud-sweep groundgear (20-cm or 8-in rubber discs strung on 1.3-cm or 2-in long-link chain) towed at continuous speed of 4.6 km/hr (2.5 kts) for the 2012 eastern Bering Sea slope survey under weather conditions considered safe and typical for survey sampling.</p>
<p>Minimum overall vessel length required is 120 feet. Vessel must be able to maintain a minimum cruising speed of 16.5 km/hr (9 nm/hr) in low sea states.</p>
<p>Split trawl winches holding 2.53 cm- (1 in-) diameter steel-core trawl cable with 2,000 m (1,100 fm) available for fishing on each drum to reach the deeper stations at a 2:1 scope ratio.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The government intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with Site Explorer Company, 4872 Knottingham Circle, Eagan, MN 55122-2793 to provide Kiosk Software updates for The Alaska Public Lands Information Center (AAPLIC), Anchorage, AK 99501.. Please see the below Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for further details.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please-mail contract specialist, Jordan Gunn with responses or questions regarding this requirement at jordan_gunn@nps.gov.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background: The Alaska Public Lands Information Center (AAPLIC) was created in 1980 under a provision of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). The center is one of four cooperative information and education centers throughout the state with the mission to support the appropriate use and enjoyment of Alaska's public lands and resources through "one-stop shopping" for information, trip-planning assistance, and resource education. Although managed by the National Park Service, the center represents nine different state and federal agencies including the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, Bureau of Land Management, Alaska Department of Fish & Game, Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Alaska Department of Community & Economic Development, and the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities.
In October 1998, Alaska Public Lands Information Center sought to develop two public use kiosks which would engage visitors in the natural and cultural values of Alaska's parks while providing multiple levels of geographic data for planning to the state's national parks. Michael Koutnik was awarded a contract to provide the programming to assemble the geographical information with some basic interpretive stories (images with text, photos, and selected multimedia) about each national park in Alaska. Mr. Koutnik had developed a similar system, called Site Explorer, at Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. 
1. FAR Statutory Authority cited:  6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition. Per FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) the below vendor is the only vendor capable of providing the required services;  Mike Koutnik Site Explorer Company 4872 Knottingham CircleEagan, MN 55122-2793
2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.
The objectives of this project are to:
-Provide high-quality and continuously current geographic base maps as a basis for attaching interpretive information useful to visitors to Alaska.-Update and expand the geographical base maps to include the full range of Alaska's public lands (federal and state lands other than national parks representing the AAPLIC's nine participating partners) that AAPLIC is charged with interpreting. -Expand interpretive and informational content to include streaming of live internet feeds including displaying weather over the map of Alaska, calculating routes for visitors wishing to drive to sites of interest, linking to web pages for sites of interest, and accessing web cams or other live content for sites of interest. -Replace, at a minimum, content currently available on the existing kiosk (GIS layers, multimedia, links to external content, and other interpretive content).  Provide the ability to add and manage content: geographic sites and associated multimedia, links to web sites, photos, and other interpretive data.-The system must not exist on the National Park Service network but use a secure web server that uses applications that can run on both the local kiosk environment at the visitor center as well as within browsers accessing content over the internet. The user interface must also restrict users to the developed site (prevent users from "getting out" of the kiosk application.

3. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.).
Mike Koutnik with Site Explorer Company is uniquely qualified to conduct this work for the following reasons:
Mr. Koutnik developed the original programming and applications successfully used at the Anchorage Alaska Public Lands Information Center in its present configuration. He assembled the geographical data and linked content (guided photos and text of specific areas, campgrounds, trials, and cultural features of interest to visitors to the parks) in its present configuration. The programming and its interconnections are unique and proprietary.
Mr. Koutnik is intimately familiar with the programming needs, geographical data, and interpretive content involved in the requested enhancement of the public use kiosks. Mr. Koutnik has worked in the field of GIS programming and applications for over 36 years and has a high level of expertise required for the enhancement of this specialized product.  The current data on the public use kiosks at Alaska Public Lands Information Center represents a ten year investment in program updates and content additions and represents a logical extension of the work already done. It is important that the functionality and content of the present system not be lost to the detriment of the time and energy of the AAPLIC staff.
4. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:
Other options were unnecessary due to the proprietary data that is currently on the Kiosks. As this project is just an update of the existing software and information on the Kiosks it is a logical follow on to the original contract. No other vendors are able to provide this service. 
5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:N/A
6.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The government intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with Extensis, Inc. , 1800 SW First Ave., Suite 500, Portland, OR 97201 to provide digital asset sharing software for Kenai Fjords National Park, Kenai, AK 99664.. Please see the below Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for further details.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALFOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

BACKGROUND:  
- Extensis Portfolio software is currently the Alaska Region standard.  It is in use in Denali National Park, Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, Katmai National Park and Preserve, and Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.  It works across the Region's network to allow digital asset sharing among parks.    Because it is widely used throughout the Region, it will have better technical support than any other software program.  Its professional edition comes with a searchable web-based database into which photographs can be easily uploaded from multiple computers and organized into usable folders.  - Digital images are an essential element in a range of park media, including web-pages, newsletters, exhibits, press-packets, etc. With the advent of digital technology and the ease of acquiring images, Kenai Fjords has an ever growing library of digital photos with no system in place to manage them. 												
1) FAR Statutory Authority Cited:  10 U.S.C. 2304 (c )(2 ), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
- Reason for Authority Cited:  The use of Extensis Portfolio digital asset management software is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured or installed by another company:
Extensis, Inc.Attn: Kari Friedwald1800 SW First Ave., Suite 500Portland, OR 97201503.290.0304
2)  Description to meet the Park's needs:
- In order to be useful to Kenai Fjords National Park, the software must have browser-based access for multiple users and have the ability to support controlled access groups.  Controlled access groups is critical for security of sensitive information.   Extensis Portfolio in one of two known software programs that has the specifications needed.  The other program, Canto Cumulus, would not work across the National Park Service network and would not communicate with other parks (DENA, GAAR, KATM, LACL) that are using Extensis Portfolio.- Extensis Portfolio software will allow Kenai Fjords National Park to share assets with other Alaska Region parks.  It will significantly increase park efficiency in accessing digital images and save a great deal of staff time that is currently wasted by not having an organized system. This project will increase visitor satisfaction with park media since media producers will be able to access high quality images for a range of park publications and other media.- Portfolio Server is supported by local Windows volumes (NTFS, FAT32), removable media (CD, DVD, external hard drives), and Windows file shares (SMB/CIFS).  Its metadata tools include single item and batch metadata editing: add, replace, delete, delete all values, and QuickFind searches across filename, description, and keywords by default.   Portfolio supports cataloging, applying metadata, and finding any file format. Portfolio also supports a wide range of file formats for thumbnailing, previewing, playback, viewing, document text indexing, metadata extraction, and metadata embedding. 

3)  Market Research conducted (efforts to obtain other Source) or state reason for not conducting market research:
- Kenai Fjords National Park staff surveyed all parks within the Alaska Region currently using digital photo management software.  Staff talked with administrators and users to determine the effectiveness of the products used.- Kenai Fjords National Park had purchased and had been utilizing ThumbsPlus software.  The software did not function with park servers and data was lost between offices.  ThumbsPlus does not have browser-based capabilities and will therefore not function at Kenai Fjords National Park.- The Park conducted market research by contacting vendors and manufacturers through the internet, CCR database, trade journals, and contacting local vendors.  Canto Cumulus is the only other digital asset management software that was in competition with Extensis Portfolio.  It was determined by speaking with experts in the field and National Park Service IT personnel that Extensis would work better with the IT needs of the National Park Service.
4)  Other Factors to support Sole Source only:
- Extensis Portfolio Server software is the Alaska Regions standard for digital asset management.  It has been purchased and is currently in use by Denali National Park, Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, Katmai National Park and Preserve, and Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.  Administrators and users within the park have been pleased with the software's overall performance and have commented on its success in remote locations.  - Extensis Portfolio software meets the guidelines of the National Park Service Digital Asset Management program.
5)  Technical Certification:
 "I certify all possible research to find a competitive source has been exhausted.  No other item/brand will suffice."

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>Hydraulic System Pump Upgrade to KC-135/R/T/OC-B (419 aircraft in total)
<SOLNBR>FA8105HydraulicSystemPump2
<RESPDATE>012111
<CONTACT>Kjulonda L. Ogles, Contract Specialist, Phone 4057395405, Email kjulonda.ogles@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump (Left and Right) Upgrade to KC-135R/T/OC-B (419 aircraft in total).
<p>PURPOSE<br />The C/KC-135 Aircraft Sustainment Branch Contracting Office (GKC/PK), Tinker AFB OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost of developing and installing a 3 and/or 10.0 GPM Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump Upgrade(Left and Right) to meet all of the requirements in Table 1. This solution shall address meeting requirements in Table 1 and should not be limited to replacement of both the left and right pumps. The optimal solution would provide an independent onboard method of supplying hydraulic fluid with appropriate pressure and capacity to both the left and right hydraulic systems during ground operations. The hydraulic pump solution should be capable of accepting DC power for the purpose of charging the brake system for aircraft movement.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION<br />The KC-135 R/T/OC-B hydraulic system consists of four engine driven hydraulic pumps (NSN 4320-01-242-5153HS/PN PV3-205-39), one on each engine, that provide 3000 PSI to two separate hydraulic systems at 22.5 gallons per minute (GPM) flow. In addition, there are two auxiliary pumps (NSN 3010-00-5675873RK/PN DO81 (DC Motor), 4320-00-864-8677HS/PN PF24-3906-24ZH4 [Right Pump], NSN 4320-00-768-6345HS/PN 65W01020 [Left Pump]) both rated at 0.76 GPM flow. However, the 0.76 GPM flow from the current auxiliary pumps does not allow sufficient flow to support timely testing of all hydraulic systems. To facilitate ground testing, maintainers are required to run engines/or use the MJ-2A hydraulic test stand and the A/M 32A-86 electric cart. Requiring maintainers to run engines and/or test equipment is time consuming and costly to the Government. Providing an independent onboard method of supplying hydraulic fluid with appropriate pressure and capacity to both the left and right hydraulic systems will require a 3 and/or 10.0GPM pump, and would alleviate the use of hydraulic test stand which would result in a manpower savings, avoid engine runs for pre-flight checks that would resulting in fuel savings, and increase aircraft availability to support the warfighter.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking a Government off the shelf or commercial off the shelf solution that provides capability to sustain continuous operation of hydraulic systems on the aircraft without use of engines and hydraulic carts. If these requirements cannot be met, please provide the systems that cannot be supported by the proposed solution.</p>
<p>RESPONSE<br />Responses shall address:</p>
<p>1. Developmental schedule (duration from contract award to on aircraft testing completion)<br />2. Install Schedule using three different contract field team lines<br />3. Estimated developmental cost (including nonrecurring engineering and technical data)<br />4. A Kit and B Kit Cost break out <br />5. Estimated installation cost with installation hours (broken down by system)<br />6. The components/methods proposed to be replaced or modified<br />7. The expected reliability maintainability &amp; availability (RMA) improvement of replacement components<br />8. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)<br />9. Description and rational of proposed system capabilities and operation<br />10. Details of proposed replacement components/methods to include, but not limited to, items such as electrical, hydraulic power system requirements, airworthiness certifications actions completed, current usage on other systems or in development, logistics support requirements/availability (parts supply, spares, repair, support equipment, tech data, training, pro and cons etc.)<br />11. Component lead times (longest lead time only for each system is required)<br />12. Maximum aircraft modified per year<br />13. One option for a 3 GPM pump and/or a second option for a 10 GPM pump.</p>

No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Procurement and Grants Office (Atlanta) has been tasked to solicit for the award of a project to include the design and construction (Design-Build Contract) for three individual projects on the CDC Fort Collins Campus, 3156 Rampart Road, Fort Collins, Colorado. The proposed project will be a Firm Fixed Price contract. The type of solicitation to issue will depend upon the responses to this synopsis. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis, or for any follow up information requests.<br /><br />The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small Business Community to include 8(a) firms to perform a Firm Fixed Price Contract.</p>
<p>The projects are generally described below, but the scope is not limited to:</p>

Special foundations may be required due to expansive soils. The Contractor will perform all required soils testing and site surveys. Soils borings for the recently constructed Building 401 are available for the Contractor's use, but are not guaranteed to represent conditions of this nearby site. The building design and quality of construction will be based substantially on an existing building located on campus. The project includes the site preparations and site work to allow vehicular and pedestrian access from an existing parking area. The contractor will be required to relocate approximately 45 upright and chest ultralow freezers including their contents which are biological samples (BSL-2 and BSL-3 materials) at the end of the project.</p>

<DESC>1 PURPOSE<br />This synopsis is for informational and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a solicitation or a commitment to issue a solicitation. It is issued for the purpose of conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to determine industry capabilities, including those of small businesses, to meet the Government's requirement.
<p>No solicitation is being issued at this time and the Government makes no assertion that a solicitation will be issued. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for, any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. <br /><br />2 BACKGROUND<br />USCIS is the government agency that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. USCIS secures America's promise as a nation of immigrants by providing accurate and useful information to our customers, granting immigration and citizenship benefits, promoting an awareness and understanding of citizenship, and ensuring the integrity of the immigration system.</p>
<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows U.S. employers and individuals (in some cases) to file various petitions seeking lawful employment in the U.S. based on employment credentials. Many of these petitions involve Professors, Scientists, and Researchers, who file petitions under the following categories:</p>
<p>&bull; Individual of Extraordinary Ability: 203(b)(1)(A) of the INA;<br />&bull; Outstanding Professor or Researcher: 203(b)(1)(B) of the INA;<br />&bull; Member of Professions with Advanced Degree or Exceptional Ability, including National Interest Waivers: 203(b)(2) of the INA; and,<br />&bull; Individual of Extraordinary Ability: 101(a)(15)(O)(i) of the INA.</p>
<p>Approximately 25,500 petitions are received annually under these categories which relate to SPREE filings. USCIS' SCOPS Directorate has four Service Centers throughout the U.S. (California, Nebraska, Texas, and Vermont) which currently process the petitions after receipt. The current processing time for standard processing from receipt of petition to final decision is approximately four (4) months. Additionally, USCIS offers Premium Processing on some cases which requires an adjudicative action in fifteen (15) days or less.</p>
<p>At this time, a standard method does not exist to evaluate the professional qualifications of Scientists, Professors and Researchers, which include, without limitation, education, experience, publications, scholarly research, journal impact, awards and patents. As such, SCOPS adjudicators rely heavily on the Internet to research the validity of the information submitted in these petitions.</p>
<p>3 OBJECTIVE<br />This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is intended to determine the number of potential offerors qualified to provide services that will assist SCOPS in standardizing its research and evaluation of professional qualifications and other field-specific benchmarks (detailed below) for Scientists, Professors and Researchers, thus improving the quality of petition adjudications and reducing processing times and the amount of paper evidence that is required to support the petition. SCOPS envisions achieving this objective via a web-based application/database infrastructure through which adjudicators would generate qualification summaries and/or evaluation reports to assist them in the evaluation of SPREE filings.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of executing the following:</p>
<p>&#61656; The contractor shall be capable of providing access to an electronic database through which SCOPS employees can verify evidence and produce summary and/or evaluation reports related to Scientist, Professor and Researcher petitions including, without limitation, the following categories:</p>

<p>Stomachs shall be examined as soon as practical, usually within a few hours after an animal is brought to shore. The stomachs shall be evaluated relative to amounts and types of prey. An estimate of the total stomach contents volume shall be made and a sample of contents shall be collected from the forestomach whenever possible. Samples from these stomachs shall be kept frozen and shipped to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game office. Each sampled whale shall be classified as 'feeding', 'not feeding', or 'uncertain' based on methods described in Lowry et al. (2004). &nbsp;Analysis of stomach contents data shall be compared with an existing time series of diet data and shall be reported as scheduled for the BOWFEST quarterly reports.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct analysis on the "digestive efficiency" of bowhead whales. Samples of free-swimming prey shall be compared to samples from bowhead forestomach, duodenum, and colon. Analysis shall examine caloric and isotopic content. Comparing data from these samples may help make estimates of the "energy extraction" efficiency of bowhead whales.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be from April 2011 to April 2013.</p>
<p><br />The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541620 with a size standard of $7 million.

These items will then be used to rebuild the gas generators utilizing new generator housings, nozzles, connector plates and anodes.  The reworked gas generators will need to be labeled, packaged and palletized for shipment and storage in accordance with the product drawing package and MIL-STD-1168.  There is also a requirement to perform a helium leak test to check the integrity of a nozzle assembly seal prior to loading of the energetic into the gas generator assembly.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years (extension optional)<br />7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS, Almaty, Kazakhstan <br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>A) BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria (GFATM) is a global public private partnership which was created in 2002 to dramatically increase resources to fight HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, and to direct those resources to areas of greatest need. Governments, civil society, the private sector and affected communities partner to implement programs and work in close collaboration with other bilateral and multilateral organizations to supplement existing efforts dealing with the three diseases. The USG contributes to the GFATM through PEPFAR, and has provided about 27% of all GFATM contributions. The cumulative annual mortgage of the increasing number of GFATM grants and the pressures of the global economic crisis have resulted in increased competition for new grants and more stringent scrutiny on eligibility criteria and reporting on results. It is therefore critical that the Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) provide effective and governance and oversight of these grants to maintain their funding. Planned USG HIV interventions under PEPFAR in Central Asia are also highly dependent on the operation and success of Global Fund HIV grants. Several CAR countries have seen their GFATM grant funds suspended or the CCM deemed ineligible for further funding by GFTM/Geneva due to inappropriate policies and lack of governance. The USG therefore has a great interest in the success of GFATM grants. It is important to state that, though the GFATM Liaison position will be funded through PEPFAR, s/he will be actively engaged in improving the performance and management of GFATM grants in all three diseases (HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria).</p>
<p>GFATM in Central Asia</p>
<p>The USG enjoys a pleasant relationship with the GFATM and the CAR Regional CCMs. USG participation and assistance is welcomed and encouraged. The five Central Asian Republics have current approved funding for 24 grants totaling $287 million. In some countries, problems with program management, conflicts of interest and accountability have resulted in program audits and the possible rejection of several grant proposals. Recent failures of key countries to meet the GFATM's six CCM minimum requirements highlight the need for the CCM to reassess their structures and modes of operation. Frequent issues noted by the GFATM Secretariat include basic CCM structure, representation and governance.</p>
<p>Recent GFATM audits in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have highlighted serious shortfalls in national policy, leadership and program decision-making, which affect program governance and performance. Inappropriate national policies and lack of governance have resulted in substantial funds being frozen or the country becoming ineligible for next GFATM funding rounds. Many CAR governments view the CCM as a government project management unit (PMU), rather than a broadly representative oversight body, and the majority of CCM members are Ministers and senior government officials. The Chair of several of the CCMs is the Deputy Prime Minister and government policy is to restrict participation by non-government organizations. In many countries, CCM members do not have sufficient technical understanding of the diseases their programs are meant to address, nor do they have time to conduct real program oversight and informed decision-making. GFATM requirements for CCM composition are well-known and have been presented to all CCMs, though in many cases they are not met. Historical leniency in country grant oversight by the GFATM Secretariat is now becoming more stringent and several countries are finding it very difficult to make the needed adjustments to their grant management behavior. A high degree of diplomacy and political savvy are required to advise these CCMs on needed policy changes and assist them to reconcile national policy and systems to grant management requirements imposed by GFATM/Geneva. Other challenges to grant implementation include ongoing issues of management deficiencies in grant implementation, limited civil society involvement, and restrictive government policies. Most problems faced by the CCMs (including those rendering them ineligible for funding) are resolvable or could be assisted with minimal outside technical assistance, if the CCM and government policy would permit this. One challenge is that once grants are awarded, CCMs and Principal Recipients (PRs) rarely request or want involvement of international partners to assist with grant implementation or monitoring. In recent months, more countries are now making use of available technical assistance and working through key policy changes to function within the GFATM requirements.</p>
<p>B) BASIC FUNCTION</p>
<p>The Liaison serves as a senior policy advisor to the CCMs in all five CAR countries and is the USG focal point on Global Fund activities, policy and coordination with the USG in the region. This will require exceptional diplomacy and understanding of host country policy and GFATM requirements in order to establish trust and credibility with the CCMs (some of which do not initially desire this assistance), working in collaboration with the PEPFAR Coordinator. The successful candidate will assume responsibility for coordinating ongoing and critical communications among the USG PEPFAR Country Team, the CCM, the Global Fund Secretariat in Geneva, the regional Ministries of Health and other strategic partners regarding the management and implementation of the Global Fund program. S/he will serve as a policy and governance advisor to assist the CCMs to conform and adapt to GFATM/Geneva guidelines and recommendations to retain funding eligibility and improve effectiveness. The Liaison will become the regional USG expert advisor on current GFATM and USG policy, budget and program issues, and how they may impact existing and possible future grants and national programs. S/He will regularly update the rest of the USG PEPFAR team on new developments in GFATM-PEPFAR policy and programming, and advise on strategic and policy vision to strengthen GFATM-PEPFAR partnership and coordination. The successful candidate is expected to play a central role in the creation of strategic partnerships and conceptualization of a resource mobilization strategy for technical assistance with the Global Fund, other donors and technical partners. Additionally, this position will work with stakeholders in strengthening the multi-level partnerships requisite for joint and multi-sectoral programming.</p>
<p>Most of the Chiefs of Mission (COM) in the five countries have limited engagement or knowledge of the GFATM, its goals, and implementation challenges in each country. While each USG point of contact has provided Global Fund briefings to the COM, more could be done to increase COM engagement in order to strengthen host country commitment and involvement. The Liaison will actively engage the COMs on the GFATM in the context its relation to PEPFAR and USG interests of country self-governance and participatory programs, as well as the need for GFATM grant effectiveness as a platform on which to build PEPFAR support. The Regional Global Fund Liaison will work to elevate the importance of the success of the Global Fund through more routine communication with COMs and technical support to USG points of contact to strengthen COM awareness of the Global Fund in each country.</p>
<p>The USG (represented by USAID) is a member of the CCM in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. The CCMs in Central Asia are routinely made up of Deputy Ministers and other high-level stakeholders. The USG has provided technical assistance to writing proposals in all countries and provided feedback in the USG's parallel review of the proposals. The USG is a member of the GFATM Board and is involved in significant policy decisions.</p>
<p>The USG in CAR recently completed its first PEPFAR Regional Operational Plan (ROP) which will guide future USG HIV/AIDS activities in the region. The success of the PEPFAR program is highly dependent on the effectiveness and enlightened governing policies of the GFATM programs in each country. The PEPFAR team has established ambitious targets which can only be achieved with well-functioning GFATM and national HIV programs in all countries. The plan therefore includes providing intensive assistance to governments and GFATM PRs to improve grant performance and efficiency. The role of the Regional Global Fund Liaison will include analysis of country policies and guiding strategic vision for the USG team to leverage and improve the performance of these much larger Global Fund grants.</p>
<p>The USG is in the process of launching several new projects, which are intended to work closely with and provide high-level policy and technical assistance to improve GFATM grant implementation. The Regional Global Fund Liaison will work closely with the CCM, Principle Recipient (PR), Sub-recipient (SR) and other key stakeholders to help guide and advise them to identify and prioritize key obstacles to performance, and to develop specific and acceptable interventions for these actors to undertake to improve overall grant effectiveness. S/He will help to shape specific policy and technical assistance work scopes from USG-funded partners and monitor implementation and results.</p>
<p>The Central Asia Regional GFATM Liaison will work under the leadership of the U.S. Ambassadors to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, and under the day-to-day oversight of the PEPFAR Regional Coordinator in Kazakhstan, as part of the USG PEPFAR Team in Central Asia. This position will be administratively hired and managed by the USAID Regional Office in Almaty. In accordance with USAID rules and regulations governing its programs and operations, USAID shall administer most administrative and human resource requirements of the Regional Global Fund Liaison, including but not limited to, payroll, personnel files, managing the USAID contractor evaluation process, and any required formal approval of travel. The Regional PEPFAR core Team will also consult frequently with the Liaison and provide guidance as appropriate.</p>

<p>8. POSITION DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">A. Background</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Based in Pristina, the Senior Energy Advisor will be assigned to the USAID/Kosovo Economic Growth (EG) Office and will be responsible for development and oversight of the Mission's energy sector policies and activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Senior Energy Advisor will serve as the Mission's principal technical resource on energy sector development and as the Mission's primary point of contact on matters relating to energy programming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a highly qualified professional, substantial reliance will be placed on the Senior Energy Advisor to independently plan and carry out the specific activities entailed in fulfilling major duties and responsibilities.&nbsp; Energy is one of the Mission's most challenging, high-profile and important sectors, requiring constant interaction with Kosovo's highest level officials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the Mission's senior level advisor on energy, the Senior Energy Advisor will exercise significant independent judgment on matters of policy and technical direction, and will be required to independently make decisions that ensure successful program implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Senior Energy Advisor will also be the Mission's principal day-to-day liaison with other U.S. Government agencies, in particular the U.S. Embassy in Pristina, and international organizations and foreign donors engaged in providing assistance in Kosovo's energy sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He/she will report frequently to senior Mission management and will advise senior level U.S. Embassy and other senior officials from Department of State, donor organizations, and host government on energy policy and reform and USAID's strategy to support the energy sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He/she will meet regularly with heads of international organizations, including the International Civilian Office, EULEX, the World Bank, IMF, the European Commission and other bilateral donor agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Senior Energy Advisor will serve as the focal point for all USAID assistance relating to the energy sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He/she will be responsible for formulating strategies for energy sector reform and development and managing energy activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This will include ensuring that the design and implementation of all USAID energy activities are coordinated with the Government of Kosovo, international organizations, and bilateral and multilateral donors active in the energy sector in Kosovo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>USAID/Kosovo's energy-sector program is oriented first and foremost towards the pursuit of two high-level objectives: the realization Kosovo e Re Power Plant transaction, which seeks private investment to operate the new Sibovc lignite field, to rehabilitate the Thermal Power Plant Kosovo B, and to develop phased introduction of operate the new lignite-mining and generation capacities; and the privatization of the distribution functions of the incumbent state-owned power utility, KEK.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both of these intermediate objectives are crucial to the achievement of the Mission's overarching objective of creating a sustainable energy industry to serve the needs of Kosovo's own economy, and the maximization of Kosovo's inherent comparative advantage as an electric power producer in the southeast Europe region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Energy security is a significant vulnerability for Kosovo with far-reaching consequences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The existing power plants (Thermal Power Plants Kosovo A &amp; B) are in poor condition and subject to risk of major failure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The electricity sector is a major drain on the budget due to persistent subsidies and the need for power imports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Power shortages continue and technical and financial losses remain high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Overall sector reform, including privatization, is essential and will best be achieved by attracting financially strong and technically experienced private sector investors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a signatory to the Energy Community Treaty for South-East Europe (ECT), Kosovo's energy sector reform and restructuring will comply with ECT requirements and obligations and with EU obligations for markets and environmental standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the new USAID/Kosovo Strategic Plan 2010-2014, under Assistance Objective 2 for "Increasing Private Sector-Led Economic Growth", Intermediate Result 2.3 is to ensure that "<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kosovo Has a Reliable Energy Supply".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The principal Mission result for this IR is "Kosovo Energy Corporation Network and Supply Division (KEK DistCo) privatized by 2011".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over the life of the strategy USAID will address to varying degrees the three key strategic elements to achieve energy security - diversification of supply, development of domestic resources, and energy efficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition to current USAID/Kosovo's activities directed at support for DistCo privatization, a key US Government commitment is to support Kosovo in successful completion of the Kosovo e re (New Kosovo) Power Plant transaction, or KRPP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In early 2010 the KRPP transaction was reconfigured with four pre-qualified consortia to include: development of new lignite mining in the Sibovc field; rehabilitation with potential life extension for thermal plant Kosovo B; and phased development of up to 1200 MW of new generating capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>USAID energy portfolio assistance in support of privatization is currently implemented through three main projects to promote effective commercialization of KEK DistCo, unbundling the mining, generation and network and supply functions while maintaining asset value and helping to prepare the proper deal structure for its successful privatization. Assistance is also in place to support the energy regulator and to develop and implement a new market design. This work entails significant collaboration with other donors (including the European Commission Liaison Office (ECLO), the German bilateral Kreditanstald fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), and World Bank) to ensure overall successful transactions linked to overall energy sector reform and restructuring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Assistance to support reform in the legal, regulatory and market framework is deigned to ensure highest environmental standards are met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>USAID and project advisors work closely, in direct and regular contact, with the Ministries of Energy and Mining and Economy and Finance to provide direct and frequent counsel to the Ministers and staff on important policy issues related to the two high-priority transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition the USAID/Kosovo energy-sector program is bolstered through participation in two regional energy reform initiatives, managed by USAID/Washington, one implemented by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and the other by the United States Energy Association (USEA).</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to modify contract 200-2009-30162 to Emergent Biodefense Operations Lansing, Inc. for the sole source purchase of doses of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA, also known commercially as Biothrax).

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. For contractual questions contact Christine N Godfrey.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE
The U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region (7), Alaska, intends to award two sole source, firm-fixed price purchase orders to: Native Village of Selawik, Selawik, Alaska and Native Village of Kotzebue, Kotzebue, Alaska.  Both Native Villages will provide genetic mixed-stock analysis and composition of Inconnu from the Hotham Inlet and Selawik Lake.
Both Native Villages currently have persons with experience and local knowledge of the Selawik Lake, Lower Selawik River, and Hotham Inlet and skills for correctly identifying sheefish, collecting detailed fisheries biological information as well as traveling in Arctic winter conditions.  This will result in reduced time learning the geography and winter travel logistics in the Selawik Lake, Lower Selawik River, and Hotham Inlet area, will benefit from local logistics resources, and be a safer project as it will occur in winter conditions that demand local knowledge of travel and winter survival techniques.
Work description:Both Native Villages are  to provide a combination of 2,400 sheefish genetics samples for the sheefish genetics study to support the research objectives:1.  Estimate the proportional contributions of Kobuk and Selawik River inconnu stocks to spatial and temporal strata of the winter subsistence fishery, and 2. Test the hypothesis that proportional contributions of Kobuk and Selawik River inconnu stocks from individual sample areas are equivalent and describe the spatial and temporal distribution of inconnu stocks.
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.

All vendors offering an "Equal To" product must provide supporting documentation that their product can meet the requirements in listed in the SOW. 1) The proposals will be graded subjectively with final ratings of, "Exceptional", "Acceptable", "Marginally Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". A score of "Exceptional" would mean that the proposed requirement offers an added benefit, a score of "Acceptable" would mean that the proposed product fully met the requirements, a score of Marginally Acceptable means that the proposed product minimally met the requirements, and a score of "Unacceptable" means that the offer will not be considered for award because the proposed product did not meet the requirements.</p>
<p>PRICE:<br />All price quotes will be evaluated to determine whether the pricing is reasonable; however, the lowest-priced bidder will not necessarily be awarded the order. In the event that two or more products proposed are of similar merit, price will be determining factor.<br />All vendors submitting a quote shall fill out the attached Microsoft Excel spreadsheet titled, "Attachment 3: Price Sheet for Science and Engineering Resources ". <br />(x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (OCT 2010).

<p>The purpose of this request is to identify interested candidates that possess the qualifications to design the nuclear instrumentation, from concept through final design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The qualified responders will receive a formal request for proposal for the work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The request for proposal will include technical and functional requirements for the four subsystems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The eventual design may include off-the-shelf, modified off-the-shelf, or custom components, provided that they meet the technical and functional requirements.</p>
<h1><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><span>&bull;I.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>BACKGROUND</h1>
<p>The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) is a pressurized water reactor whose principal function is to provide a high neutron flux for experiments involving reactor fuels and materials. The reactor, owned by the U.S. Department of Energy, has a design thermal power of 250&nbsp;MW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its nominal inlet pressure and temperature are 360&nbsp;psig and 125<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">&deg;</span></span>F. The nominal core outlet temperature is 170<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">&deg;</span></span>F at the design thermal power level. The ATR and its support facilities are located at the ATR Complex at the Idaho National Laboratory.</p>
<p>The ATR supports many different experiment programs. Irradiation experiments in ATR fill a vital role in the development of naval reactors and are expected to play an important role in the development of new reactors. To support safe and reliable operation of the ATR, the Idaho National Laboratory initiated the ATR Life Extension Project in 2006.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Early project activities included a material condition assessment of selected ATR components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The assessment identified the items requiring attention to mitigate various aging effects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The assessment identified various nuclear instrumentation subsystems requiring improvement, including the four subsystems addressed by this request for expression of interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The following paragraphs provide some technical information about the subsystems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Log Count Rate Meter (LCRM) Subsystem</h2>
<p>The LCRM subsystem provides information to plant operators concerning low-level neutron flux and flux changes in the core. The information minimizes the threat of an unplanned criticality. In addition, the subsystem provides ATR operators with information about the neutron flux levels and flux changes during startup.</p>
<p>The dual channel LCRM subsystem uses two fission chambers to provide signals that monitor neutron population. When the reactor is at power, the LCRM system is secured and the associated fission chambers are withdrawn from the core region.</p>
<p>The existing LCRM subsystem uses a fission chamber operated in current mode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The electronics in each LCRM channel consist of the following items:</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo4"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>a solid-state preamplifier located in the nozzle trench, assembled from commercially available parts;</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo4"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>a solid-state LCRM module mounted in the amplifier cabinet,</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo4"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>a power supply module mounted in the amplifier cabinet, which supplies power to the individual channels, and</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo4"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>an isolation transformer mounted in the amplifier cabinet.</p>
<p>The existing LCRM subsystem uses two Leeds and Northrop pen and paper chart recorders in the reactor control room, as well as count rate meters and speakers on the reactor top and output to the Console Display System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wide Range Neutron Level (WRNL)</h2>
<p>The safety-related WRNL subsystem monitors neutron flux from 10 to 5e9 nv and is one of several analog subsystems that form the Plant Protection System (PPS). It monitors thermal neutron levels and their rate of change, providing a reactor shut-down signal when the reactor period is less than a preset limit or when the flux level exceeds a threshold.</p>
<p>The subsystem comprises three channels, each consisting of a compensated ion chamber (CIC), a preamplifier, an electronics drawer, various switches, a power supply, a control room recorder and output to the Console Display System.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The electronics drawer automatically selects one of 12 zero-based ranges from 10 to 5e9 nv.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The WRNL drawer and pre-amplifier have combined response times of less than 2.5 msec for ranges 9 through 12 and 12.5 msec for ranges 1 through 8, both for an input step change of 67% full scale to 88% full scale with the setpoint at 80% full scale. The existing WRNL subsystem uses three Leeds and Northrop pen and paper chart recorders to provide a Reactor Control Room display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Neutron Level and Neutron Level No. 8 Subsystem</h2>
<p>The safety-related Neutron Level subsystem monitors neutron flux from 5e4 to 5e9 nv during pressurized and depressurized (factor of 100 less) operations. The Neutron Level Drawer incorporates three independent gains of 100x, 1-2x, 1x. The drawer displays 2.5 decades of range. It also provides a reactor shutdown signal to the PPS when the thermal neutron flux exceeds a threshold. The system comprises three channels, each consisting of an uncompensated ion chamber, a preamplifier, an electronics drawer, various switches, a power supply, a control room chart recorder and an output to the Console Display System display.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The drawer and pre-amplifier have combined response times of less than 2.5 msec.</p>
<p>The Neutron Level No. 8 subsystem, though not a part of the PPS, monitors neutron flux over the reactor power range and provides a signal for a non-safety related power reduction. The NL No. 8 subsystem provides a fourth neutron level channel which, in combination with the NL subsystem, provides indication of neutron level in all four quadrants of the reactor core. The subsystem provides a method to monitor reactor power variations. The NL No.8 subsystem is comprised of the same components as the individual NL channels: an uncompensated ion chamber, a preamplifier, an electronics drawer, a power supply, and a control room recorder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Neutron Level and Neutron Level Number 8 subsystems use four Leeds and Northrop pen and paper chart recorders to provide a Reactor Control Room display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Log-N Period Subsystem</h2>
<p>The Log-N Period Subsystem comprises two channels, each consisting of a CIC, a power supply, a Log-N Period amplifier, a Log-N recorder, and a Period recorder. The readout information of reactor period and power level is provided on two Log-N recorders and two Period recorders. The recorders re-transmit the signal to the Reactor Data Acquisition System, which then forwards a signal to the Console Display System. The Log-N Period subsystem supports the Reactivity Control/Safety Rods System by providing signals to restrict, inhibit, or permit safety rod, Outer Shim Control Cylinder, and neck shim withdrawal under various reactor power level scenarios. Further, the Log-N Period subsystem supports the Control Power Reduction Subsystem by providing a reactor power reduction signal through the period recorder. The Log-N portion of the system is safety related, as it provides an indication of initial conditions during low power operation.</p>

N00244M313     EVALUATION OF OFFERS USING CAPABILITY TO PERFORM AS MINIMUM CRITERIA, PAST PERFORMANCE AND PRICE FACTORS (APR 1996) (FISC SAN DIEGO)

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.  

    (i) CAPABILITY TO PERFORM
    (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE
    (iii) PRICE

(b)  Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).
  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is equally as important as Factor (iii), PRICE.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

(c)  By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.
  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  

(d)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.
  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 

Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.
  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(e)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.
  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(f)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/. 
 
All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

<DESC>1 PURPOSE<br />This synopsis is for informational and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a solicitation or a commitment to issue a solicitation. It is issued for the purpose of conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to determine industry capabilities, including those of small businesses, to meet the Government's requirement.
<p>No solicitation is being issued at this time and the Government makes no assertion that a solicitation will be issued. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for, any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. <br /><br />2 BACKGROUND<br />USCIS is the government agency that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. USCIS secures America's promise as a nation of immigrants by providing accurate and useful information to our customers, granting immigration and citizenship benefits, promoting an awareness and understanding of citizenship, and ensuring the integrity of the immigration system.</p>
<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows U.S. employers and individuals (in some cases) to file various petitions seeking lawful employment in the U.S. based on employment credentials. Many of these petitions involve Professors, Scientists, and Researchers, who file petitions under the following categories:</p>

<p>Approximately 25,500 petitions are received annually under these categories which relate to SPREE filings. USCIS' SCOPS Directorate has four Service Centers throughout the U.S. (California, Nebraska, Texas, and Vermont) which currently process the petitions after receipt. The current processing time for standard processing from receipt of petition to final decision is approximately four (4) months. Additionally, USCIS offers Premium Processing on some cases which requires an adjudicative action in fifteen (15) days or less.</p>
<p>At this time, a standard method does not exist to evaluate the professional qualifications of Scientists, Professors and Researchers, which include, without limitation, education, experience, publications, scholarly research, journal impact, awards and patents. As such, SCOPS adjudicators rely heavily on the Internet to research the validity of the information submitted in these petitions.</p>
<p>3 OBJECTIVE<br />This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is intended to determine the number of potential offerors qualified to provide services that will assist SCOPS in standardizing its research and evaluation of professional qualifications and other field-specific benchmarks (detailed below) for Scientists, Professors and Researchers, thus improving the quality of petition adjudications and reducing processing times and the amount of paper evidence that is required to support the petition. SCOPS envisions achieving this objective via a web-based application/database infrastructure through which adjudicators would generate qualification summaries and/or evaluation reports to assist them in the evaluation of SPREE filings.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of executing the following:</p>
<p>&#61656; The contractor shall be capable of providing access to an electronic database through which SCOPS employees can verify evidence and produce summary and/or evaluation reports related to Scientist, Professor and Researcher petitions including, without limitation, the following categories:</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; mso-layout-grid-align: none" align="center"><strong><span style="COLOR: black">Request for Information (RFI) Radio Frequency Identification Solution</span></strong></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">I. Description:</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotes. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback concerning its submission. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Government is not seeking proposals at this time. Additionally, the Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Note that responses should not take the form of a proposal and will not be understood as such. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned. Full requirements will not be provided. This RFI is intended to provide the Government with market research.<strong><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">II. Strategy:</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">A Customs and Border Protection (CBP) strategic goal is to become more efficient for IT asset management: to be able to effectively count, locate and track asset movement within the datacenter. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Although this RFI is focused on data center IT assets, near term solutions must be expandable to other non-IT assets including planes, boats, firearms, canines, horses, non intrusion technology.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">CBP would like to perform a Proof-of-Concept (POC) to confirm RFID usage at the data center is feasible and can support asset management of data center assets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the POC is successful, CBP would like to grow the use of RFID within the organization to support asset management. The information derived from the Request For Information would allow CBP to plan a Capability Demonstration and develop a Concept-of-Operations (CONOPS). Dependant upon the progress and information obtained during the POC, CBP reserves the right to change direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The POC should show how manual asset validation, which requires too much labor and only addresses lost assets after the fact, can be eliminated or significantly reduced.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-list: none; mso-list-ins: 'Nick Martinelli' 20101130T1355"><span><ins datetime="2010-11-30T13:55" cite="mailto:Nick%20Martinelli"></ins></span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">III. Purpose:</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">CBP has a significant number of IT assets that must be managed effectively. The primary requirement for asset management is to properly identify these assets. Manufacturer bar codes and CBP-applied asset number tags are two ways assets are currently identified. The serial numbers link the asset to CBP's inventory tracking system. These labels are both labor intensive in nature and support a limited amount of information for the asset.</span><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black">Therefore, CBP initially seeks an IT RFID Asset Tracking Solution, which provides both real-time location visibility with rules-based alerting and reporting of critical or highly valued equipment and material with a guaranteed 100% in room level accuracy as well as the necessary middleware to provide passive location services for fixed or expendable assets. This capability must interface with existing COTS solutions within the CBP enterprise and this capability needs to be expandable for assets other than IT.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">As part of this effort, CBP is gathering information on technology that can address one or more of the following objectives:<strong><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objective #1</span>: RFID inventory enterprise management system.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">Smithsonian institution is issuing&nbsp;a request for proposal for a Construction Management at Risk Contract (CMc) for the construction of the NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE (NMAAHC). The proposed contract listed here is UNRESTRICTED. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Smithsonian. The new NMAAHC museum will be constructed on the National Mall near the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. The site is approximately five acres in area and bounded by Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Streets, NW. The site will be developed with landscaping and improvements to be used for outdoor museum programs in a manner consistent with its context and contributing to a National Historic Landmark on the National Mall. The facility program calls for a new museum building of approximately 330,000 gross square feet which will be a place of collaboration with museums and other organizations to promote the study and appreciation of African American life and its impact on the nation and the world. The new museum will include exhibition galleries, performance and public program spaces, a theater, food service, and retail. Non-public spaces will include a loading dock, collections handling and work rooms, administrative offices, and support spaces. The design will incorporate state-of the-art technologies for exhibits, research, and communications, and the new facility is planned to achieve LEED Gold certification. The Smithsonian anticipates awarding a contract for pre-construction services by mid 2011 and commencing of site preparation activity in late 2011. The Smithsonian expects contractor turnover of the building for the installation of exhibits starting in late 2014 and the new museum will open to the public in November 2015 to coincide with symbolic moments in the narrative of American history.</p>
<p>The selected CMc shall provide Pre-construction Phase Services and Construction Phase Services through a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) agreement. Total period of performance including Pre-construction and Construction is estimated to be from notice to proceed in April 2011 to substantial completion in November 2014. The estimated construction cost is between $240,000,000 and $290,000,000. Critical elements of the work include, but are not limited to; pre-construction services, site work, utility work, excavation, sheeting &amp; shoring (slurry wall), foundations, dewatering, concrete and steel super-structure, landscape and hardscape, high level architectural finishes (both interior and exterior), MEP systems, elevators, roofing, exterior curtain wall with unique fa&ccedil;ade treatment, food service equipment, and theater specialties. Additional requirements for performance include: procedures and documentation to ensure compliance with the established LEED building criteria; practices, procedures and documentation related to integrated building commissioning; and knowledge of procedures for the use of BIM.</p>
<p>Firm evaluation and selection will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Best Value Procurement, utilizing a two-step procurement model. Step I of the RFP will consist of a list of prequalifying criteria to assist the agency in identifying those CMc contractors that have demonstrated past specialized experience in comparable and non-comparable CMc projects and other relevant qualifying factors. It is the Smithsonian's intent to advance the most highly qualified companies for further consideration under Step II, technical and pricing evaluation of the RFP. Companies which are advanced to Step II of the RFP will be evaluated in accordance with the technical criteria as set forth in the RFP</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220 and the size standard under this code is $33.5 million average annual receipts over the last three years. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. If the selected firm is a large business, a subcontracting plan consistent with PL 95-507, PL 99-661 and PL 100-656 will be required with the proposal. A minimum goal of 40% of the total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small business concerns. At least 20% of total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with Small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions; 10% with Women-owned small businesses (WOSB); 10% shall be placed with Hub-zone Small Businesses (HubZone), 5% with Veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB); and 5% with Service Disabled Veteran-owned small businesses (SDV). The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal. Any prime or joint venture found to be officially notified of non-compliance on past contracts and the non-compliance is outstanding will not be considered for this project. Failure to adequately explain reasons for not meeting previous contract goals may result in a lower overall rating and ultimate non-selection. An approved small business-subcontracting plan will be required prior to award. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.bpn.gov. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. TELEPHONE OR EMAIL REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED. Contractors Please note: Online Representations and Certifications Applications (OCRA) apply to this solicitation. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representations and certification information, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. You no longer have to submit representations and certifications with your proposal.

<p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:<br />a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b.

Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes.</p>
<p>Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>2. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.</p>
<p>Past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.</p>
<p>(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all Quotations shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each Quotation strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written Quotation. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a Quotation and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Quotations, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such Quotations may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those Quotations so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of Quotations. If the two or more highest rated technical Quotations are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Quotation Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit Quotations that will be considered by the agency. Quotations must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Quotation. Quotations must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Quotations must be received no later than 13 DEC 2010, 11:00 A.M. Eastern Standard Time. Quotations received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Quotations may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: tara.m.holloway@uscg.mil .</p>

<p>OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
