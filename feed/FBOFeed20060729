<DESC>I. The Winter Harbor Thinning acquisition is planned as a firm-fixed-price stewardship contract pursuant to P.L. 108-7 (16 USC 2104 Note). It includes LAND MANAGEMENT SERVICES, where the Government will pay a contractor for services; and TIMBER REMOVAL AND SALE, where the contractor will purchase the timber harvested under the LAND MANAGEMENT SERVICES. The LAND MANAGEMENT SERVICES includes (i) the harvesting and yarding of selected young-growth timber in three cutting units to provide for wildlife enhancement/thinning; and (ii) the treatment of slash created from harvesting and yarding activities to provide for favorable wildlife access in one cutting unit. The value of the forest products removed from Forest Service lands (TIMBER REMOVAL AND SALE) will be an offset against the prices the Government will pay for the LAND MANAGEMENT SERVICES. 

II. As mentioned above, the LAND MANAGEMENT SERVICES includes (i) the harvesting and yarding of selected young-growth timber to provide wildlife enhancement thinning; and (ii) the treatment of slash post-harvesting and yarding for wildlife access. The harvesting will involve 28.7 acres in three cutting units; the yarding will involve use of shovel and cable yarding systems provided by the contractor. The slash work will involve manual and/or mechanical treatment of slash created along shovel and cable corridors in one 15 acre unit post-harvest and yarding.

III. The estimated price range for the harvesting and yarding is less than $50,000; the estimated price range for the slash treatment is less than $10,000. The estimated volume of the timber to be removed is 612 MBF of hemlock and spruce sawlogs with a standard rates value of $4,764. These are only estimates, and offerors remain responsible for determining their prices. The period of performance is (i) by completion of the 2008 field season for the harvesting and yarding; and (ii) by completion of the 2008 field season for the slash treatment.

IV. Winter Harbor is in Southeast Alaska's Alexander Archipelago, on the central west coast of Prince of Wales Island. The project is located near the Marine Access Facility at Winter Harbor.

<DESC>A. This project consists of three phases to accomplish stream restoration work on a portion of Sal Creek. Please note that fish timing restrictions (due to the presence of steelhead trout) require the completion of Phases II and III to be between July 18, 2007 and August 15, 2007.

B. Phase I. This phase will consist of (1) pushing over up to 150 whole spruce trees with root wads attached, up to 24” diameter at breast height (DBH), from along the roadside with a crawler mounted excavator; (2) falling up to 50 designated trees up to 24” DBH via sawyer; (3) gathering up to 50 downed cull logs from landings; and (4) transporting all trees/logs with the low-boy or log truck and stockpiling them along NFSR 3020000 and a temporary spur road at MP 0.2 on NFSR 3020000.

C. Phase II. This phase shall be accomplished between July 18, 2007, and August 15, 2007, due to fish timing restrictions, and will utilize the logs stockpiled in Phase I to construct log structures. This work will entail (1) Brushing and clearing trees for access and constructing temporary access routes to up to 8 stream restoration sites; (2) 2) Moving stockpiled logs from the north side of Sal Creek to designated restoration sites; and (3) Constructing log structures along the flood plain and within the active high water mark of Sal Creek (the log structures are based on a triangle frame in which up to 2/3 of each log is buried in the bank or the streambed). 

D. Phase III. This phase shall be accomplished between July 18, 2007, and August 15, 2007, due to fish time restrictions, and will entail removing old log culverts and road material from the temporary spur road adjoining NFSR 3020000 at MP 0.2. 

E. This project is located on Prince of Wales Island and can be accessed from the existing road system. NFSR 3020000 is located in the Sal Creek watershed, approximately 10 road miles along NFSR 30, north of the city of Thorne Bay. The Inter-Island Ferry Authority (http://www.interislandferry.com/) services Prince of Wales Island with daily service from Ketchikan to Hollis and weekly service from Coffman Cove to Petersburg and Wrangell.  Commercial tug and barge services are scheduled weekly into Thorne Bay from Ketchikan. Ketchikan also has no highway or bridge connections, but does have airport and Alaska Marine Highway System connections. 

F. This acquisition is planned as a firm-fixed-price contract. The Government estimates the value of the acquisition to be less than $150,000—but this is only an estimate and offerors are responsible for determining their prices. 

G. A written solicitation numbered AG-0109-S-06-0020 will be issued. The solicitation (Request for Proposals) will be posted on FedBizOpps website for viewing and printing on or about 14 AUGUST 2006. Potential offerors must obtain the solicitation from the Internet.

<DESC>Seakeeper 1000 Ocean and Weather Monitoring System
EA133C-06-RQ-0757

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with The International Seakeepers Society, 4101 Ravenswood Road, Suite #128, Fort Lauderdale, Fl  33312 for Seakeeper 1000 Ocean and Weather monitoring system which is an automated modular, telemetering, logging ocean and weather system for the R/V AUK.   The International Seakeepers Society is the only provider of Seakeeper 1000 equipment.  No other vendors offer a package that includes data on Chlorophyll “a” and the ability to automatically send this data to the NOAA/National Weather Service.  The National Weather Service has a sole source agreement with Seakeepers to provide instrumentation for their data buoys.  Measuring Cholorphyll “a” is a requirement because it is a measure of primary productivity in the sanctuary which is the foundation of the food web.  Transmitting data to the National Weather Service is a requirement because it maximizes the utility of this expensive NOAA asset by providing real-time weather data.  The Seakeeper 1000 sensor package tracks water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and Chlorophyll “a”content, and pH, as well as air temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure.  In addition, the Seakeeper 1000 equipment communicates these dta to shore-side NOAA/National Weather Service offices via satellite, for use in weather forecasting.   In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.  For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.  The statutory authority is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  

The NAICS Code is 423690, small business size standard is 100 employees. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement.  The International Seakeepers Society is the only known source capable of providing the equipment required.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to this requirement by August 8, 2006.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. August 8, 2006 will be considered by the government.    Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Janie.M.Laferty@noaa.gov.  Note 22 applies.

<OFFADD>Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, R-10 Alaska Region, P.O. Box 21628 Acquisition Management Regional Office, Juneau, AK, 99802-1628
<SUBJECT>F -- SDVOSB SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION SOURCES SOUGHT FOR USDA FOREST SERVICE ALASKA REGION
<DESC>A. The Forest Service's Alaska Region is interested in increasing its number and dollar value of service and construction contract awards to Service-Disabled-Veteran-Owned-Small-Business (SDVOSB) firms.  Accordingly, we invite SDVOSBs who provide services or construction (but not supplies) to consider the needs of our region and our region’s offices and to prepare a brief white paper not exceeding two pages in length describing the SDVOSB’s service or construction offerings and its interest in and ability to perform in and around the locations where the Forest Service maintains offices, including Anchorage, Seward, Girdwood, Cordova, Yakutat, Hoonah, Juneau, Sitka, Petersburg, Wrangell, Thorne Bay, Craig, and Ketchikan.  Of these cities, only the first three are connected to the continental highway system and the remaining ten are reached only by plane or boat.  One may learn about the USDA Forest Service’s Alaska Region by visiting http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/; even more learning may occur by following links to each of the National Forests within the region.

B. If you are a SDVOSB which provides services or construction (but not supplies) of a type used by Forest Services offices in Alaska, and if you are willing and able to perform in and around the locations where the Forest Service maintains offices, then we invite you to make yourself known to us by preparing the white paper mentioned above and sending it to John Inman, Federal Building, 648 Mission Street, Ketchikan AK 99901.  In addition to describing your service or construction offerings and your ability to perform in our locations, the white paper should also include your firm’s name, address and other contact information, website url, DUNS number (or DUNS+4), and affirmative statements that your firm (a) is currently registered in the Central Contractor Registry at http://www.ccr.gov; (b) is currently registered in the On-Line Representations and Certifications database at https://orca.bpn.gov/; and (c) is not affected by Excluded Parties List at http://epls.arnet.gov/.  

C. The Forest Service will use this information to help decide if future acquisitions should be set-aside or reserved for SDVOSBs.

D. Please note that this synopsis's Classification Code F and NAICS 115310 were selected only because the fedbizopps website requires a single selection in each of these. However, SDVOSBs offering any service or construction (except as noted below) of interest to the Forest Service's Alaska Region are invited to reply.

E. Please further note that the USDA Forest Service’s Alaska Region does not procure information technology hardware or services, as this function is centrally managed for the agency.  Thus, we have no interest in receiving white papers from firms offering information technology services.

F. Additionally, all SDVOSBs are invited to regularly check this fedbizopps website for Alaska Region contracting opportunities—after going to http://www2.fbo.gov/spg/USDA/FS/index.html, please check the R10 Anchorage, Juneau, AND Ketchikan sites, as opportunities from across the region may be posted on any one of these three sites.

SCOPE: The contractor shall provide all travel, plant, supervision, materials, design, and labor necessary to demolish 40 two-family housing units, located in the Bicentennial Military Family Housing area at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. 2. PRINCIPAL FEATURES: The work to be accomplished consists, in general, of the following principal items. This does not mean that the work consists only of these items. But, that it consists of these principal items along with all incidental minor work which becomes necessary to complete in order to accomplish the overall project in a satisfactory and workmanlike manner meeting the approval of the Contracting Officer. This incidental work is to be included in the Contractor’s estimate at the time of submittal to the Contracting Officer. a. Provide to the Contracting Officer prior to the commencement of work, any specific plans for actions not called for in this Statement of Work, specific differing procedures for actions called for already, and plans for removal of asbestos known to exist in the buildings to be demolished. Surveys for asbestos containing materials and lead-based paint are attached for the contractor’s use along with the Altus AFB standards for removal as part of a demolition project. Questions concerning Lead Based Paint or Asbestos in the units should be addressed to the 97th CES Environmental Flight. b. Assure that all utilities attached to the units are shut off prior to the start of the demolition work. Utility shutoff shall be coordinated between the contractor and the 97th Civil Engineering Squadron at Altus AFB. c. Demolish 40 duplex housing units located in Bicentennial Housing at Altus AFB, OK, some of which are two-story units. Demolition shall be accomplished using mechanical contrivances such as track-hoe, front end loader, bulldozer, or other similar equipment. Other acceptable practices are manual demolition by workmen, or mechanically assisted manual demolition. Under no circumstances may explosives be used for any part of the work. d. After demolition of the structure above the concrete slab foundations, the concrete slabs shall be demolished and hauled away. e. Contractor shall demolish and haul away all driveways leading to the units, as far as the sidewalks. If sidewalk is damaged in this process, it shall be replaced by the contractor as part of the work required by this project. e. The contractor shall have the option of salvaging any usable items from the structure prior to demolition. Examples of salvageable items may be light fixtures, water closets, lavatory sinks, cabinets, doors, etc. All salvaged items will become the property of the contractor. f. Prior to the general demolition, any required hazardous material remediation shall be accomplished. Any identified asbestos, lead-based paint, etc. shall be removed and properly disposed of before the bulk of demolition can proceed. g. Before demolition of air-conditioning units, or their removal, all refrigerants shall be removed from the units and captured in approved containers which meet all local, state, and federal rules, regulations, laws, etc., regarding capture and disposal of refrigerants. Contractor shall be responsible for disposal of any such refrigerants removed as part of this project. h. Debris generated by the demolition shall be removed from the worksite by the contractor and disposed of off base in an environmentally sound manner. All debris shall be cleaned up and hauled away from the site to a state-approved landfill or recycling center. i. Haul route(s) shall be as shown on the drawings. Other haul routes may be considered, but must be approved by the government before use by the contractor. If a temporary haul road is approved, it shall be built and maintained by the contractor during the performance period of the contract, and demolished by the contractor when no longer needed, and shall be built, operated, and demolished at no additional cost to the government. After the road would be demolished, the area where it is located shall be returned to its original state. j. Capping of Utilities: · Utilities shall be capped as follows: Sewer lines shall be capped at the wyes using plugs in the wyes, or the wyes removed and capped with a pipe cap. Water lines shall be capped with repair clamps at the mains. Gas shall be capped using sweated caps on copper lines, and PVC or matching caps on plastic lines. Electrical shall be removed up to the distribution transformer and disconnected at that point, and the conductor and conduit to the house removed. · After underground utility lines are removed, the contractor shall backfill the trenches/holes made by this removal and compact the soil removed and replaced by use of walk-behind or other mechanical vibratory compactor. It is the intent of the government to have the sites cleared of all utilities to a depth of three feet up to the point of termination of utilities to remain. · After backfill and compaction, the entire work area shall be leveled by use of a small grader or other such contrivance, to leave the area graded to match up with surrounding elevations and shall include any fine grading required to leave the finished area acceptable for the installation of sod while providing positive drainage to existing ditches, drains, etc. If imported fill dirt is required to maintain existing grade lines, the fill shall be provided by the contractor as part of the project and shall be free of foreign-debris and suitable for topsoil usage. k. After grading, the contractor shall establish new sod over all areas disturbed by the demolition. The contractor shall install sod over the entire cleared and graded area. Sodding shall be accomplished in accordance with the guidelines established in the publication, “Guideline Specifications to Turfgrass Sodding”, published by Turfgrass Producers International, 1855-A Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL. Of special interest to the government is that when the turf is established after all demolition is completed, the final profile of the work area shall be level without significant bumps, ridges, knolls, or other general surface irregularities. Sod shall not be left with projecting corners or edges lapped over adjoining strips of sod. Sod shall be placed level and rolled or otherwise worked to provide a relatively even surface after it is fully established and growing. For growth establishment, the contractor will be allowed use of government provided water from existing water lines and/or fire hydrants in the area to irrigate the new turf until it is fully established. The contractor shall be responsible for providing adapters, connectors, piping, hoses, and sprinklers necessary to irrigate the grass. l. The existing rented chain-link fencing around Bicentennial Housing shall remain in place for the duration of the demolition contract. The contractor may mount signs or other materials on the fence temporarily, but must remove any such items from the fence upon completion of his work. The fence gates used for access into and out of the demolition area shall be secured at the end of each workday to assure that children or other potential trespassers will not have access to the area. The demolition contractor is hereby notified that the government does not own this fence, and any damage to the fence caused by demolition activities will be the responsibility of the contractor to repair or pay the owner of the fence for repair or replacement. At his own option and expense, the demolition contractor may erect additional fencing for whatever reason he may deem necessary or may ask that the temporary fencing be removed so that he may provide his own construction fence. Any fencing, gates, or accessories installed as part of this contract shall be removed upon acceptable completion of the work and all holes/disturbed areas returned to their previous conditions. m. The contractor shall refer to UFGS 01572 Construction and Demolition Waste Management as the guide for requirements concerning recycling, reuse, and disposal of demolished or dismantled materials and equipment, and reporting on disposition of these items. Adherence to the requirements of UFGS 01572 in all its sections and subsections shall be considered as part of this project. The contractor may refer any and all questions pertaining to this specification to the Environmental Flight of 97th CES. 3. SPECIAL SCHEDULING: The demolition shall be so scheduled as to assure that the area encompassing Liberty Circle will be worked first. Demolition in this area must be completed first in order to allow for planned construction by the new Military Family Housing privatization contractor. It is highly recommended that sod operations begin as soon as an area is completed to allow for new sod to become established. A site visit is scheduled on 7 August 2006 at 10:00 A.M. CST. Only one site visit will be available for this project. Contact MSgt Anthony Overbay or MSgt Carl See by 4:00 P.M. by not later than 6 August 2006 4:00 p.m. CST if you plan on attending the site visit.
