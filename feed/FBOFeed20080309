<DESC>USAID/Ethiopia invites comments and suggestions on a revised draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the implementation of the USAID/ETHIOPIA Food by Prescription for HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment Programs. The new Food by Prescription (FBP) Program will support the delivery of therapeutic and supplementary foods and counseling services to moderately and severely malnourished HIV positive individuals.  

PEPFAR/Ethiopia supports the provision of nutrition and food support to specifically identified target populations when such support directly contributes to meeting the prevention, treatment and care goals of the U.S. Five-Year Global HIV/AIDS Strategy; and when nutrition interventions are based on scientifically-established World Health Organization (WHO) assessment criteria and guidelines for nutritional care. Furthermore, PEPFAR/Ethiopia has worked closely with other bilateral donors and the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) to access food resources for therapeutic and supplementary feeding from multiple sources.  

In this context, PEPFAR/Ethiopia programs will provide therapeutic and supplementary food support to moderately and severely malnourished patients within the context of specific eligibility and exit anthropometric criteria consistent with WHO and/or national guidelines. In time, moderately to severely malnourished patients will transition from time-limited therapeutic and supplementary feeding to leveraged food security programming so that People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and their families can address their broader health, food security, and livelihood needs. Additionally, therapeutic and supplementary feeding will be provided to Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC), regardless of their nutritional status.

USAID/Ethiopia invites comments and suggestions on the attached revised draft SOW from firms and organizations eligible to compete, experts in the area of HIV/AIDS, and other interested parties. Eligible firms and organizations are strongly encouraged to review the document, provide comment, and consider submitting a proposal in response to the resulting RFP. The purpose of posting this revised draft SOW is to enhance the quality of the SOW therefore comments and suggestions received may be considered as the SOW is finalized. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. We are soliciting comments and suggestions from interested parties in order to enhance and further refine the draft SOW. Comments will be appreciated and considered as we finalize the SOW, however comments and suggestions may or may not be incorporated in the SOW. USAID/Ethiopia will not be able to respond to questions or requests for clarifications resulting from this pre-solicitation notice or the draft SOW.
