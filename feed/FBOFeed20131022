Crowder at sharon.d.crowder@nasa or fax to (256)961-9604 no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 30, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<SUBJECT>66--Notice of Intent to Sole Source to SCIREQ USA Inc. for FlexiVent FX System
<SOLNBR>RFQ-DC-14-00003
<RESPDATE>110613
<ARCHDATE>12302013
<CONTACT>Derek Davis
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to SCIREQ USA Inc. for the purchase of FlexiVent FX Complete System Solution.
Scope and Capabilities: The objective is to upgrade the FlexiVent equipment currently existing in the laboratory.  This equipment is necessary to assess effects of air pollutants on pulmonary function in laboratory animals, which will contribute to human health risk assessment.
The FlexiVent FX Complete System Solution has the following specifications which will enhance the capability of ORD to assess effects of air pollutants on pulmonary function in laboratory animals:
Order No.	Description FV-FXCS 	flexiVent FX Complete System Solution ? FV-FX2 	flexiVent FX2 system, 4.2 ml stroke ? FV-FXB 	flexiVent FX Base Unit ? FV-FXM2 	flexiVent FX Module 2, 4.2 ml stroke ? FV-FXA-23 	FX adapter for modules 2 & 3 ? SW-FW7.5 	flexiWare software version 7.5, full license ? FV-FXY-23L 	Y-tubing Kit for use with FX Module 2 & 3 ? XS-PM-30 	Pressure manometer 3.0 kPa ?

FV-MSX1 	flexiVent multi subject extension for four parallel anaesthetized mice ? FV-MSC1 	flexiVent multi subject controller for mice ? PC-ID1 	Plethysmograph assembly for dual intubated mice ? FV-MSX1-Y 	Y-tubing Kit for use with multi subject extension ? FV-FXCP 	flexiVent FX Cleaning Package
                                Training: CS-IT 		On-site installation & training (excl. expenses)						- Includes installation, presentation, basic training & hands-on training ? CS-IT2 	On-site installation for additional system/modules, etc.                                                         CS-ITX 		Installation & training expenses
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. The FlexiVent FX Complete System is the only known system to assess pulmonary function in small rodents inclusive of the EPA?s required specifications.  These include: measurement of total lung resistance and compliance, partitioning of resistance and compliance measurements into central and peripheral airways components, analysis of flow-volume loops, and simultaneous measurement of EKG function and body temperature.  This type of equipment will permit pulmonary mechanics to be assessed in 4 mice at one time.  This will significantly improve the EPA?s capacity to perform assessments of air pollutants from the current single mouse system.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to co mpete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Derek Davis via email to davis.derek@epa.gov no later than 4:00 pm EST, 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Tammy A. Taylor, Contracting Officer, Phone 6174943462, Email tammy.taylor@dot.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe) intends to conduct negotiations in anticipation of awarding a purchase order to Advanced Digital Systems Incorporated (doing business as Mi-Co), a small business located in Durham, NC on a basis of other than full and open competition under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) as referenced in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5. The order will be for three hundred (300) Mi-Forms Enterprise SmartForm perpetual licenses, five (5) years of annual maintenance, Mi-Forms basic and advanced training courses, a discovery and business process analysis, and professional implementation services for a period of approximately five (5) months. The Government has several minimum needs for their SmartForm solution inclusive of the following: accurate handwriting recognition, multi-modal feedback to a user (visual or aural) to reduce data entry errors at the point of capture, ability to improve the appearance of handwritten data on a mobile device, interaction with paper forms, maintenance of data validation in an asynchronous network environment, rapid deployment via an integrated development environment of new forms into an existing workflow, workflow creation and control, ability to pivot end point deployments (write once, deploy to many different hardware platforms), ability to secure data at rest and in transmission from central server to mobile devices, creation of validation rules on the form to reduce data entry errors at the point of capture, and ability to interface with a number of back end relational databases. Based on market research done, the Government has found the Mi-Co Mi-Forms software solution is the only commercially available solution to meet all the Government's needs. Specific criteria not offered by other products are the handwriting recognition and asynchronous capabilities. This is why the Government intends to award to Mi-Co on a basis of other than full and open competition. The applicable North American Industry Classification System number is 511210 with a size standard of $35.5 million. There is no quotation document available for this acquisition. As this procurement is for a commercial supply/service, interested parties shall make inquiries and/or provide capability information to the contact point shown in this notice within seven&nbsp;(7) calendar days after publication of this announcement, or by 1730 hours EST on 28 Oct 13. All timely responses received shall be considered by Volpe. Businesses will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with information submitted in response to this announcement.<br />

It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. &lt;p&gt; Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of five (5) pages or less indicating the ability to perform the following aspects of the effort described below: &lt;p&gt; NASA is seeking potential suppliers to provide NASA Grade Ammonia and related services for Kennedy Space Center &lt;p&gt; While it is most desirable to obtain all the tasks in a single procurement, there are several tasks that could be procured separately depending on supplier capabilities: &lt;p&gt; 1) Filled Ammonia cylinders 2) Empty/Drain ammonia cylinders processing 3) Additional analysis on Filled cylinders (NVR) &lt;p&gt; If you are unable to meet all the tasks, please respond as to which of these individual tasks you can meet (if any). &lt;p&gt; In addition, if you cannot meet the 8 week turnaround time requested on these tasks/products, please provide an estimated turnaround time for completing the tasks (after GFE is provided by the Government, as identified in the Statement of Work provided below). &lt;p&gt; This information will be used in developing the final RFQ package(s). &lt;p&gt; This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  &lt;p&gt; All responses shall be submitted to Shea Reeves via email at shea.c.reeves@nasa.gov no later than 11/01/2013.	Please reference "NNK14OA01L" in any response. BEGIN STATEMENT OF WORK &lt;p&gt; Anhydrous Ammonia &lt;p&gt; Background &lt;p&gt; NASA grade Ammonia is required to support Orion coolant loops (testing and pre flight servicing) at Kennedy Space Center, FL.  The ammonia shall be stored and transported in 150 lb capacity compressed gas cylinders provided by the Government.  The estimated quantity of ammonia required is 9 (nine) cylinders with 150 +/- 10 pounds net in each cylinder. &lt;p&gt; In addition to cylinders requiring filling with ammonia, there is a requirement for the recertification and revalving of approximately 3 (three) 150 lb capacity compressed gas cylinders (to be utilized as Ammonia Drain Cylinders). None of these empty cylinders will require ammonia fill but may have some residual ammonia that will require draining prior to recertification and revalving. After recertification and revalving, these empty cylinders will requiring sampling for water content, final draining and be backfilled with a pad pressure of gaseous nitrogen prior to shipment (per Section 8.3). &lt;p&gt; All 150 lb capacity compressed gas cylinders provided by the government (both those requiring ammonia fill or those delivered empty), will require recertification prior to delivery by the supplier. In addition, the existing single port valves with educator tubes (also known as Dip Tubes) on the cylinders will require replacement with new dual port valves and educator/dip tube. All dual port valves and dip tubes will be provided by the Government along with the cylinders.  The dual port valve/dip tubes will be in a cleaned condition and in a single assembly when provided by the Government. All original (single port) valves and educator/dip tubes removed from the cylinders shall be returned to the Government. &lt;p&gt; In addition to the analysis required to verify the Ammonia purity requirements (per Section 1.0), there is an additional analysis requirement for Total NVR (Non Volatile Residue) as described in Section 8.0. This NVR analysis will be for Engineering Use Only (ex: hardware performance trending) and Total NVR will not be a determining factor in the procurement quality of the Ammonia.  This Total NVR analysis will only be required on cylinders filled by the Contractor (ie: does not apply to Empty/Drain cylinders) &lt;p&gt; Requirements 1.0	  CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES &lt;p&gt; The NASA grade Ammonia shall meet the requirements in table 1.	 &lt;p&gt; Table 1.

CYLINDER CLEANING/PROCESSING/FILLING PROCEDURE: &lt;p&gt; Cylinders requiring filling with Ammonia: &lt;p&gt; Cylinders shall be drained of any residual ammonia.  The original (single port) valve and educator/dip tube shall be removed.  The cylinder shall be cleaned (steam cleaned or cleaned by other suitable method as approved by the Contracting Officer).  Then the cylinder shall be re-certified.  After recertification, the cylinder shall be cleaned again (steam cleaned or cleaned by other suitable method as approved by the Contracting Officer). &lt;p&gt; The new dual port valve and new educator tube/dip tube (both supplied by the Government in a single assembly and in a cleaned condition) shall be installed.  &lt;p&gt; The vendor shall place twelve to fifteen pounds of ammonia into the cylinder and the cylinder shall be rolled for at least 12 hours to remove any water from the cylinder. The ammonia that is rolled for 12 hours shall be tested to determine the water content in the cylinder and compared to the water requirement in section 1.0.  If the requirement is not met, the ammonia shall be drained until 50 psi of ammonia is left in the cylinder and twelve to fifteen pounds of ammonia shall be put into the cylinder and rolled again for 12 hours. The process shall be repeated until the ammonia meets the water requirement of Section 1.0. &lt;p&gt; The contractor shall pull an appropriate vacuum to fill the cylinder to 150 pounds. The supplier will identify the cylinders (by S/N) that are delivered filled with ammonia as Filled Cylinders on shipping paperwork. The Certificate of Analysis for each	cylinder shall indicate that the Ammonia meets the requirements in Section 1.  &lt;p&gt; Cylinders not requiring filling with Ammonia: &lt;p&gt; Cylinders shall be drained of any residual ammonia.  The original (single port) valve and educator/dip tube shall be removed.  The cylinder shall be cleaned (steam cleaned or cleaned by other suitable method as approved by the Contracting Officer).  Then the cylinder shall be re-certified.  After recertification, the cylinder shall be cleaned again (steam cleaned or cleaned by other suitable method as approved by the Contracting Officer). &lt;p&gt; The new dual port valve and new educator tube/dip tube (both supplied by the Government in a single assembly and in a cleaned condition) shall be installed.  &lt;p&gt; The vendor shall place twelve to fifteen pounds of ammonia into the cylinder and the cylinder shall be rolled for at least 12 hours to remove any water from the cylinder. The ammonia that is rolled for 12 hours shall be tested to determine the water content in the cylinder and compared to the water requirement in section 1.0.  If the requirement is not met, the ammonia shall be drained until 50 psi of ammonia is left in the cylinder and twelve to fifteen pounds of ammonia shall be put into the cylinder and rolled again for 12 hours. The process shall be repeated until the ammonia meets the water requirement of Section 1.0, and the final sample water content will be reflected on the cylinder Certificate of Analysis. &lt;p&gt; Following the final water sample analysis, the cylinder shall be drained of the maximum amount of ammonia practical (to maximize the use of the cylinder as a Drain Cylinder). The cylinder will then be backfilled with a pad pressure of gaseous nitrogen (MIL-PRF-27401, Grade A or commercial equivalent) to approximately 15 psi prior to shipment. &lt;p&gt; All cylinders not requiring ammonia fills will be identified (by S/N) as Empty/Drain Cylinders on shipping paperwork. The Certificate of Analysis for each cylinder shall reflect only the water content of the final ammonia sample taken. &lt;p&gt; 4.	NON VOLITILE RESIDUE (NVR) ANALYSIS In addition to the analysis required to verify the purity requirements of filled cylinders (per Section 1.0), there is an additional analysis requirement of filled cylinders for Total NVR (Non Volatile Residue). This Total NVR analysis will be for Engineering Use Only (ex: hardware performance trending) and Total NVR will not be a determining factor in the procurement quality of the Ammonia.  This analysis will only be required on cylinders filled by the Contractor (ie: does not apply to Empty/Drain cylinders) &lt;p&gt; Perform NVR analysis per the O-A-445 oil determination method, deleting separatory funnel and filtration steps.  Record and report results on Certificate of Analysis (for engineering use only).	 &lt;p&gt; When Total NVR exceeds 5 ppm by weight, contractor will identify the constituents and include on the Certificate of Analysis. Contractor will save sample residue and provide to the Government for further Government analysis. &lt;p&gt; 9.0	WEIGHT VERIFICATON &lt;p&gt; Weight verification of filled cylinders shall be done by both the contractor and the government.  The government tare weights for each cylinder are stamped on the cylinder as TW.  The contractor shall verify the tare weights of the cylinders.  If the tare weight of a cylinder is off by more than five pounds the contractor shall contact the contracting officer of the difference.	If the weights are within the five pound difference the cylinders shall be filled and shipped and verified at the receiving facility. &lt;p&gt; The contractor shall provide tare and gross weight of the filled cylinders.  The contractor shall use a NIST certified scale to weight the cylinders tare and gross weight. &lt;p&gt; 10.0	LIST OF GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED PROPERTY (NFS 1852.245-76)  (MODIFIED) &lt;p&gt; For performance of work under this contract, the Government will make available property identified below on a no-charge-for-use basis.	The Contractor shall use this property in the performance of this contract at its plant location identified under Section 5.0 and at other location(s) as may be approved by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle) for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking information from interested parties capable of providing a remote monitoring system. Battelle, in support of the DOE Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), is issuing this formal Request for Information (RFI).
<p><br />THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY; IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE A FORMAL SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED BY BATTELLE AS A RESULT OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI. BATTELLE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR PAYMENT OF ANY RESPONSE PREPARATION EXPENSES. INTERESTED PARTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADEQUATELY MARKING PROPRIETARY OR COMPETITION SENSITIVE INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THEIR RESPONSE.</p>
<p>The mission of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) is to reduce and protect vulnerable nuclear and radiological materials located at civilian sites worldwide. GTRI helps the Department of Energy achieve its Nuclear Security Goal to prevent the acquisition of nuclear and radiological materials for use in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and other acts of terrorism. Three key subprograms of GTRI -Convert, Remove, and Protect-provide a comprehensive approach to denying terrorists access to nuclear and radiological materials. The Nuclear and Radiological Material Protection subprogram supports the protection of at-risk WMD-usable nuclear and radiological materials worldwide from theft and sabotage until a more permanent threat reduction solution can be implemented. These efforts result in threat containment because WMD-usable materials are protected from theft and sabotage.</p>
<p>The Office of Global Threat Reduction is seeking to enhance the security of radioactive sources at civilian sites by enabling the use of a Remote Monitoring System to support monitoring of tamper indicating devices, area radiation monitoring, and cameras located in rooms or bunkers containing sources. The system communicates via redundant pathways to multiple monitoring locations to address both external and insider threats. The Office of Global Threat Reduction is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to identify potential prime contractors capable of, and interested in, providing Remote Monitoring Systems and warranty services to authorized users worldwide. The system is comprised of multiple elements (hardware, software, firmware) that must function in an integrated manner so that installation, operations, and sustainability are optimized worldwide. Initial unit cost and continuing warranty and maintenance costs greatly impact the long term acceptance of the system by sites. The system consists of several subsystems, including:</p>
<p>&bull;Core system hardware/firmware<br />&bull;Operator interface software that displays information<br />from and remote access to multiple systems <br />&bull;Radiation detector<br />&bull;Tamper indicating devices (TID) including external seals</p>
<p>The attached RFI consists of three sections, Part A - Company Capabilities, and Part B - Questions, and Part C - Draft Functional and Performance Requirements.</p>
<p>Responding to this RFI</p>
<p>Questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Aimee Mendoza at aimee.mendoza@pnnl.gov. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions will be answered by posting answers in FedBizOpps &amp; on PNNL's external solicitations page; accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. Battelle does not guarantee that questions received after <br />November 15, 2013 5:00pm PST will be answered.</p>
<p>All interested companies that possess the capabilities addressed herein are encouraged to respond to the RFI by providing the information specified no later than 5:00pm PST on November 22, 2013. Respondents are requested to submit one (1) electronic copy of the response to Aimee Mendoza at aimee.mendoza@pnnl.gov. Include RFI No. 256066 in the subject line.</p>
<p>Please indicate if your company is classified a small business by any of the Small Business Administration for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes <br />334290, 541330, 541712. Also indicate any socioeconomic category status that your company may have (i.e., SDB, WOSB, VO, SDVOSB, 8(a), or HUBZone).</p>
<p>Also, provide the name, phone number and email address of the person to be contacted regarding any correspondence between Battelle and the Respondent. This person should be a primary contact and capable of addressing question or issues associated with the submission and content of your response to this RFI.</p>
<p>NOTE: The use of a RFI number is for tracking purposes only.</p>

Responses to this announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, Solicitation, Request for Quote, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement.  This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation.  All interested sources must respond to any future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. <br>  <br> The National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) is the Defense Department's primary producer of ground forces intelligence.  NGIC produces scientific and technical intelligence and military capabilities analysis on foreign ground forces required by warfighting commanders, the force modernization and research and development communities, Defense Department, and national policymakers.  <br>  <br> NGIC is conducting market research for a potential requirement.  NGIC is performing market research for Anti-Armor Analysis Program (AAAP) Support services for the Combat Incident Analysis Division (CIAD) at NGIC.  The program collects, collates, and analyzes data on attacks against U.S. and coalition forces worldwide. <br>  <br> The purposes of this notice are to obtain market information about the availability and capability of sources, potential competition, set-aside determinations, how prospective firms would provide intelligence and operational support for the CIAD, and approximate costs and implementation timelines. <br>  <br> The basic mission requirements for CIAD are: Collect all available information on attack incidents against U.S. and select foreign forces worldwide, analyze these attacks, populate key fields within a database that holds all relevant attack data, manage and maintain this database to facilitate its mission, and use the database to provide responses to technical inquires (RFI).  Develop collection techniques on Attack Scene Investigations and Battlefield Vehicle Forensics.  Forward deploy Vehicle Forensic collectors and analysts as necessary.  Work with the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and inter-agencies (BATF-E, DoS DSS, etc.) to implement CIAD collection methodologies and requirements.  Direct communication between CIAD and Battalions. Support the Joint Trauma Analysis and Prevention of Injury in Combat Program (JTAPIC) mission as directed by the JTAPIC Charter.  Strengthen ties with other Intelligence Service Centers, inter-agencies, and allies.  These services will be performed primarily onsite at the NGIC in Charlottesville, VA. <br>  <br> Anticipated labor categories/duties might include: Armed Forces Medical Examiner's (AFME) Liaison, Computer Programmer Database, Battle Damage Collector Continental United States (CONUS), Crew Injury Analyst, Data Analyst I, Data Analyst II, Database Programmer, Incident Reconstruction Analyst, Information Technology (IT) Generalist, Intelligence Analyst, Intelligence Analyst/Quality Management, Lead Senior Battlefield Vehicle Forensic Teams (BVFT) Outside Continental United States (OCONUS), Project Manager (OCONUS), Project Manager/Lead Analyst, Senior BVFT (OCONUS), Senior Computer Programmer, Senior Lead BVFT (OCONUS), Statistician, Technical Requirements/Documentation Specialist, Trainer, Training Manager, and Web Programmer. <br>  <br> Performance requires a TOP SECRET contractor facility clearance.  Contractor personnel performing under this contract shall be U.S. Citizens, have a final TOP SECRET clearance with a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI), and shall be eligible for indoctrination to the Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) level.  Some positions may require a Polygraph examination if additional accesses are required.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining all necessary security clearances for contractor personnel.  This TOP SECRET level contractor facility clearance requirement may also apply to affiliates, team members, and subcontractors if they have access to classified information. <br>  <br> A cost-reimbursable type contract is anticipated with up to four (4) option-year periods, (i.e., base year plus four (4) option years). <br>  <br> Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required.

Capability statement(s) demonstrating a prospective firm's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform the tasks to provide intelligence and operational support for the AAAP program. <br>  <br> 4.	Pricing Information: The NGIC seeks pricing information rather than a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM). NGIC is looking for competitive market pricing with a place of performance at Rivanna Station, Charlottesville, VA. The labor categories identified in this Sources Sought notice encompass the services necessary to meet the requirements. NGIC is trying to determine the availability of firms in the commercial marketplace to fulfill the anticipated performance-based requirements.

However, information obtained as a result of this announcement may be reflected in the subsequent solicitation, and the Contracting Officer or NGIC CIAD manager may contact one or more respondents for clarifications to enhance the Government's understanding.  This announcement is Government market research, and may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any solicitation. <br>

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Information Directorate (RI) in Rome, NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source contract under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 with the Town of Newport, 7450 East Street Newport, NY 13416-3600 for snowplowing and sanding/salting services at the AFRL/RI Newport Research Facilities located atop Tanner and Irish Hills in Newport, NY. The resultant contract is anticipated to have a Period of Performance of 04 November 2013 through 03 November 2014, with four (4) subsequent one (1) year option periods available for exercise.<br /><br />The Newport Research Facilities are located atop two steep hills - Tanner &amp; Irish - in an area of low population density which experiences significant winter snowfall and drifting. The consistent presence of AFRL personnel onsite requires rapid and capable response to winter conditions. The facilities are accessible to AFRL personnel only by access roads which are extensions of town roads.<br />The Town of Newport is responsible for plowing the town roads leading up to the facility access roads. The Government requires that when snow accumulation reaches a depth of 4 inches, plowing and sanding/salting operations commence within one (1) hour in order to ensure facilities are accessible and safe for site personnel. Should a Contractor other than the Town of Newport be contracted with for snowplowing and sanding/salting of the facility access roads, that Contractor's ability to commence operations in a timely fashion would be diminished until the Town of Newport first plows the town roads. While a Contractor could travel to the facility access roads prior to the Town of Newport clearing the town roads, there would be an increased probability of loss for the Contractor due to unsafe travel conditions. In such a situation neither the Contractor nor the site would benefit. In fulfilling previous contracts, the Town of Newport has proven highly efficient in mobilizing a crew to plow and sand/salt the facility access roads after plowing the (town) roads leading up to them. <br /><br />The Town of Newport has demonstrated snowplowing and sanding/salting proficiency meeting or exceeding the commercial standard using its own specialized heavy equipment. The Town of Newport is responsible for the maintenance and efficient operation of this equipment because its plowing duties encompass the entirety of the town (of Newport). The equipment includes three 35-40 ton, 450-500 HP, 4-wheel drive trucks with attached 10 foot sanders, double 12 foot wings, and V-plows; one 10 foot, 350 HP two stage snow blower; one 8v92, 450 HP, 12 foot and 14 foot wing, and V-plow; and one 3 cubic yard bucket loader. Typical commercial operators do not maintain fleets of the same size.<br /><br />Please note this Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, information received by the response date of this notice will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>Posted Date:  October 21, 2013 Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Superfund RCRA Procurement Operations Division (3805R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20460 Response Date: October 25, 2013 @ 3pm EST In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to AB Sciex to provide service/maintenance agreement to AB Sciex 4000 QTRAP and Shiamadzu standard liquid chromatography system.  The justification is as follows:   AB Sciex is the only known supplier for these AB Sciex 4000 QTRAP and Shiamadzu and the only authorized repair service vendor; therefore, not available from other vendors.  The items are: 1.  4000 QTRAP 2.  Shimadzu Standard LC System NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.

<CONTACT>Yolanda Nero, Contracting Officer, Phone 913-551-7573, Fax 913-551-9573, Email nero.yolanda@epa.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue an extension of services on a sole source basis. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 7, on behalf of the Region 10 Superfund Program intends to issue an extension of services on a sole source basis to allow time for implementation of a strategic sourcing opportunity for the next round of Remedial Action Framework Response Action Contracts (RACs). Strategic sourcing is endorsed by the Administrator of EPA and works toward the President mandate on more effective contracting. A modification under the small business Architect and Engineering Services (AES) contract 68-S7-03-04 will be issued to extend services as allowed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-2 unusual and compelling urgency. The extension will be to the original contract placed under competitive Brooks Act procedures. An urgent and compelling need for these services exists as waiting for the Agency to finalize the new Superfund Remedial Acquisition Strategy procurements would result in unacceptable delays for on-going projects initiated for the protection of human health and the environment from contaminant hazards.
<p>This extension is only to address the immediate need and upon issuance of the follow on contract, work will be transitioned accordingly. It is anticipated the procurement administrative lead time to place the follow on contract may take up to one year. If however the contract is available within less than one year, the work will be transitioned to the new contracts as appropriate.</p>
<p>Information on the follow on contract is included in the Sources Sought/Request for Information (SSRFI) which has been posted to FedBizOpps at the following link: <br />https://www.fbo.gov/spg/EPA/OAM/3PM10/SOL-R3-13-00006/listing.html</p>
<p>Referenced contract is scheduled to expire on 01/31/14 which pre-dates new contract awards being made under the Agency's new Superfund Remedial Contracting Framework. As evidenced by the recent posting of the SSRFI, sufficient time does not exist to initiate and complete a Brooks Act competition for Architect and Engineering Services under FAR Part 36. A break in service poses significant risk considering the nature of the services that are currently being performed under the AES contract. In order to avoid such a break in service, EPA Region 7 (on behalf of Region 10) is issuing an up to twelve month extension to the current AES contract which will provide sufficient coverage until a competitively awarded replacement contract can be awarded which reflects the EPA's new Remedial Contracting Framework Strategy.</p>
<p>This modification will be to extend services under this non-personal services contract 68-S7-03-04. The contract was awarded competitively on 07/31/03. The modification to extend services up to an additional twelve month performance period will not increase the contract ceiling. The level of service that will be provided is in accordance with the existing contract Statement of Work (SOW), but has been significantly reduced from the original contract amount. Under the existing contract 68-S7-03-04, the contractor provides environmental architect and engineering services and has the experience and capability to continue to provide such services during the extension period, thus preventing any break in service and increased risk to human health and the environment from exposure to environmental contaminant hazards.</p>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION FOR FOLLOW-ON WORK UNDER THE REFERENCED CONTRACT. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITATION FOR THE FOLLOW-ON UP TO A 12 MONTH EXTENSION WILL BE PROVIDED. The determination not to compete this action is solely within the discretion of the EPA Region 7 as continuance of service under the referenced contract represents the best decision to meet the Government's need without causing significant financial harm, creating unnecessary delays, and damaging going enforcement and community engagement actions. The EPA Region 7 will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. This notice in no way obligates the EPA Region 7 to award the up to 12 month extension of services, sole source modification of subject contract. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than 11/04/13 by 12:00 p.m. CST&nbsp;to Yolanda Nero, Contracting Officer via email at nero.yolanda@epa.gov. The current SOW for these services is provided as an attachment to this notice. Responses to this notice must demonstrate evidence that clearly and convincingly that competition of the up to 12 month extension would be advantageous to the Government and would not hamper EPA objectives.<br />Contracting Officer Address: Yolanda Nero, 11201 Renner Rd., Lenexa, KS 66219</p>

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER REFERENCED RELATES TO CONTRACT AWARD NUMBER 68-S7-04-01 FOR EPA REGION&nbsp;10 CURRENT AES CONTRACT!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />This is a notice of intent to issue an extension of services on a sole source basis. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 7, on behalf of the Region 10 Superfund Program intends to issue an extension of services on a sole source basis to allow time for implementation of a strategic sourcing opportunity for the next round of Remedial Action Framework Response Action Contracts (RACs). Strategic sourcing is endorsed by the Administrator of EPA and works toward the President mandate on more effective contracting. A modification under the large business Architect and Engineering Services (AES) contract 68-S7-04-01 will be issued to extend services as allowed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-2 unusual and compelling urgency. The extension will be to the original contract placed under competitive Brooks Act procedures. An urgent and compelling need for these services exists as waiting for the Agency to finalize the new Superfund Remedial Acquisition Strategy procurements would result in unacceptable delays for on-going projects initiated for the protection of human health and the environment from contaminant hazards.
<p>This extension is only to address the immediate need and upon issuance of the follow on contract, work will be transitioned accordingly. It is anticipated the procurement administrative lead time to place the follow on contract may take up to 7 months. If however the contract is available within less than 7 months the work will be transitioned to the new contracts as appropriate.</p>
<p>https://www.fbo.gov/spg/EPA/OAM/3PM10/SOL-R3-13-00006/listing.html</p>
<p>Referenced contract is scheduled to expire on 06/10/14 which pre-dates new contract awards being made under the Agency's newly strategized Superfund Remedial Acquisition Framework Strategy. As evidenced by the recent posting of the SSRFI, sufficient time does not exist to initiate and complete a competitive Brooks Act competition for Architect and Engineering Services under FAR Part 36 prior to contract expiration. A break in service poses significant risk considering the nature of the services that are currently being performed under the AES contract. In order to avoid such a break in service, EPA Region 7 (on behalf of Region 10) is issuing an up to 7 month extension to the current AES contract which will provide sufficient coverage until a competitively awarded replacement contract can be awarded which reflects the EPA's new Remedial Contracting Framework Strategy.</p>
<p>This modification will be to extend services under this non-personal services contract 68-S7-04-01. The contract was awarded competitively on 12/09/03. The modification to extend services for up to a 7 month performance period will not increase the contract ceiling. The level of service that will be provided is in accordance with the existing contract Statement of Work (SOW), but has been significantly reduced from the original contract amount. Under the existing contract 68-S7-04-01, the contractor provides environmental architect and engineering services and has the experience and capability to continue to provide such services during the extension period, thus preventing any break in service and increased risk to human health and the environment from exposure to environmental contaminant hazards.</p>

Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than 11/04/13 by 12:00 p.m. CST to Jack Peterson, Contracting Officer via email at Peterson.jack@epa.gov.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>
<p>(xi) Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<a href="mailto:Tiffanie.C.Ferrell@nasa.gov">Tiffanie C Ferrell</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the creation of the ICESat-2 Traveling Altimeter Exhibit.  The NASA ICESat-2 Education and Public Outreach team is looking for a vendor to design and build this exhibit. One of NASA's major requirements is for this exhibit to travel easily to and from education and science conferences and assemble and disassemble with minimal effort. &lt;p&gt; The specifications are as follows: &lt;p&gt; 1. The major part of this exhibit will contain a 10-12 foot overhead track that will have a model of the ICESat-2 spacecraft traveling the length of it.	As it is traveling, there will be a unit attached to it that will measure the elevation (height) of anything under it. &lt;p&gt; 2. The unit measuring height will use some type of radar sensor that will be able to measure the elevation.	Attached to underside of the spacecraft should be three green LED light beam that will mimic the laser on the actual ICESat-2 spacecraft. &lt;p&gt; 3. Exhibit participants will then be able to see their height graphed on a television screen that will be directly in front of them.	After the satellite runs across the entire track, the participant will receive a print out of their own ICESat-2 Elevation. This will require a high speed, high capacity printer. &lt;p&gt; 4. The overhead track will need to be connected to a structure that is capable of housing its motor, the television screen, the printer, a start button, and a device that will know the participant is under the track (ie. Some type of recognition sensor.) &lt;p&gt; 5. The recognition sensor would sense someone standing under the track, stop what is currently on the television screen, and allow the participant to press a button that will start the spacecraft on the overhead track. &lt;p&gt; 6. When the track is not running and the television screen is not showing the graphing, we would like the screen to be showing some ICESat-2 images and visualizations that we will provide. In other words, we want the screen to always be on showing something. &lt;p&gt; 7. The other end of the overhead track should be some type of structure that will support the overhead track and be minimal in design.  We would like it to have something that identifies NASA (ie. The NASA Logo) &lt;p&gt; This exhibit should be made out of lightweight materials, hopefully recycled materials.  &lt;p&gt; This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Offerors are required to use the On-Line RFQ system to submit their quote.  The On-line RFQ system is linked above or it may be accessed at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=     . The information required by FAR Subpart 12.6 is included in the on-line RFQ. &lt;p&gt; The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. &lt;p&gt; Questions regarding this acquisition must be submitted in writing (e-mail is preferred) no later than November 06, 2013. It is the quoter's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of amendments (if any). Potential quoters will be responsible for downloading their own copy of this notice, the on-line RFQ and amendments (if any). &lt;p&gt; NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Additionally, this contract effort is a direct follow-on to contract N0463A-12-P-0065. This is a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services within the meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without substantial duplication of cost as well as significant schedule and technical risk to the Government.<br />NAICS Code 541711 applies.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under United States personal services contracts (USPSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-1</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI conducts programming in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and targeted areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, as well as in Karachi and southern Punjab.</p>
<p>In FATA/KP, the Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) program supports the Government of Pakistan's development efforts to better integrate FATA into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan.  PTI engages the Government of Pakistan's FATA Secretariat, Political Agents, as well as the FATA's tribes in participatory processes to identify community priorities and address some of the region's most immediate needs. The FS and its representative Agency structures, and the KP provincial and district government constitute the key interlocutors within the GoP for this program.</p>
<p>PTI works to counter violent extremism in targeted neighborhoods of Karachi and select districts of Southern Punjab that have been identified as Mission priorities. These activities fall under the wider Pakistan Expanded Regional Stabilization Initiative (PERSI), which aims to promote security and stability; counter violent extremism; and help build a foundation for longer-term economic, political and social development.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), manages an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  Activities range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and drinking water supply schemes, repairs to schools, roads, and flood walls, and agricultural terraces.  Sociocultural and livelihood activities are also undertaken where they have the support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  In addition, the program undertakes media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak) Regional Team, and is based in Islamabad, Pakistan as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Pakistan country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other bilateral donors, international organizations, and local government officials.  The Country Representative will oversee a team of at least 4 USPSCs, several national staff, and a significant number of implementing partner staff in at least 7 different locations across the country, including Islamabad, Peshawar, Karachi, and Lahore.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in caseswhere enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Question and Answer<br /><br />
<p>QUESTION: With regard to the Objective 1. Deliverables, the matrix states under "Required Services" that the contractor must develop tool to assess and survey each of the 28 hospitals and under the "Method of Surveillance" it states, Review of monthly progress report with final completion with 2 months. My assumption is that it is referring to the development of the survey tool, not including a review of each of the 28 hospitals within 2 months.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: <br />&bull; Assumption is correct. Development of survey tool is due within 2 months and should be part of monthly progress report.<br />&bull; Review of each of the 28 hospitals- deliverable is due with 6 months - see below</p>
<p>"Contractor must document findings and provide specific recommendations for improvements. Identify root causes and common findings throughout Indian Health System" : completion and final review within 6 months.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<a href="mailto:darlene.l.rideout.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY -  <br>    <br>  The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) on Explosive Suppressant Technologies for Emergency Responders (ER). This is a Market Survey, not a Request for Proposal.   <br>    <br>  Law Enforcement patrol officers frequently respond to a broad range of threats for which they typically have no opportunity for pre-operation planning. Further, many other groups of ER personnel, to include Emergency Medical Response, typically have even less personal protective equipment when responding to an incident. Meanwhile, explosives remain a serious and credible threat, as exemplified by the recent Boston Marathon bombings.   <br>    <br>  The purpose of this RFI is to investigate, identify, and outline existing and emerging technologies designed to provide suppression, deflection, and protection against the ballistic and blast effects of explosive incidents and mitigate collateral injury during ER operations.  NSRDEC will document these technology product options collected from the RFI, and other sources, in a Market Survey report to be made available to the ER community for their awareness and consideration.    <br>    <br>  Responses should include product performance and applicability to ER personnel based upon the proximity to an explosive event.  In addition, information pertaining to the product's ease of use, deployment and mobility for the casual user (i.e. someone who is trained in the use of the equipment, but is not required to use it as part of their primary role or responsibility) as their primary protective equipment or as alternate mitigation measures, is requested.   <br>    <br>  All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to submit information to NSRDEC and are encouraged to submit the following information:  <br>  Manufacturer  <br>  Product Name (and product graphics, if available)  <br>  Product Description:   <br>  Deployment Format (e.g. worn, detached shield, blanket/wrap, etc)  <br>  Features (e.g. weight, dimensions, time to deploy, time to dismantle, etc.)   <br>  Applications/Uses   <br>  Suppression format (e.g. protects against blast, fragmentation, both?, electronic prevention?, etc.)  <br>  Operating Requirements (i.e. resource or additional component needs - such as water/foam/ power/ other?)  <br>  Performance certification (e.g. level of protection?)  <br>  Pricing   <br>  Availability (i.e. is the product commercially available, in production, in product test and evaluation phases, under research/emerging?)  <br>  Contact Information - include company name, address, website URL, email address, and phone number for interested parties  <br>    <br>  Write-up submissions shall not exceed 10 pages in length and graphics are encouraged and do not count against the 10 page limit. Proprietary information must be labeled as such and will not be disclosed outside of the US Government. Nothing shall be construed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this RFI. Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the US Government, and will not be returned to the submitter. Responses shall be submitted by 6 DECEMBER 2013 and shall be sent via email to david.j.audet2.civ@mail.mil or by regular mail to US Army RDECOM, NSRDEC, TSPID (ATTN: David Audet), Kansas Street, Natick, MA, 01760.  DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICE.   <br>

The bidding company assumes all risks and cost for shipping the product to and from Arcata.  Arcata will ensure that the product is returned in the original packing as it is received.  Direct delivery by bidding company is also an option.  &lt;p&gt; Proposed product must interface with current LMR Conventional Motorola Centracomm analog dispatch consoles and 3 conventional Motorola Quantar Analog repeater systems audio as well as support a Digital Trunking system that will replace the legacy system in the future.

Requirement for Electronic Submission
Unless paper offers are specifically authorized in an individual solicitation, all responses to solicitations must be submitted electronically as described below.  Responses submitted in a paper form are unacceptable and will be returned.  Failure to comply with this requirement may jeopardize the possibility of receiving an award for the contract due to noncompliance with the terms of the solicitation.  You must submit your electronic offer, and any supplemental information (such as spreadsheets, backup data, technical information), using any of the electronic formats and media described below.

In addition, contractors are notified of the award via an electronic Notice of Award e-mail.  The award document will be attached to the Notice of Award e-mail. 

Acceptable Electronic Formats (Software) for Submission of Offers
1.	Files readable using the current Microsoft* Office version Products: Word, Excel, PowerPoint.  Please see security note below for caution regarding use of macros. When submitting construction drawings contractors are required to submit one set in AutoCAD and one set in Adobe PDF. (purpose: contracting can open the PDF version and engineering can open AutoCAD files)

2.	Files in Adobe* PDF (Portable Document Format) Files:  When scanning documents scanner resolution should be set to 200 dots per inch, or greater.

3.	Other electronic format.   If you wish to submit an offer using another format other than described in these instructions, e-mail the Contracting Officer who issued the solicitation.   Please submit your request at least ten (10) calendar days before the scheduled closing date of the solicitation.   Request a decision as to the format acceptability and make sure you receive approval of the alternate format before using it to send your offer.

4.	Please note that we can no longer accept .zip files due to increasing security concerns.
E-mail Submission Procedures:  For simplicity in this guidance, all submissions in response to a solicitation will be referred to as offers.
a.	Subject Line:  Include the solicitation number, name of company, and closing 
date of solicitation.  Use only one of the terms Quotation or Offer depending on the solicitation type. 

b.	Size:  Maximum size of the e-mail message shall not exceed five (5) 
megabytes.  Only one email is permitted unless otherwise stated in this paragraph or in writing by a Contracting Officer.
The offer will be date and time stamped by the Microsoft Email system and will be the official record of receipt for the submission.
 
Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
1.	Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f), 52.214-7, and 52.215-1(c)(3).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission. 
 
2.	Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.
  
3.	To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as "unreadable" pursuant to FAR Parts 14.406 and FAR 15.207(c ). 

4.	The virus scanning software used by our e-mail systems cannot always distinguish a macro from a virus. Therefore, sending a macro embedded in an e-mail message or an e-mail attachment may cause the e-mail offer to be quarantined.   You may send both the spreadsheet and the spreadsheet saved in PDF format to ensure that your proposal is readable.

Password protecting your offer is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated individuals.
Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.  Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz at the time of proposal submission will result in the offeror's proposal being deemed non-responsive. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

<p>RFP Number: N61340-13-R-1055</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement for this effort that includes removing and disposing of the current four platforms and manufacturing, delivering, and installing a new Drag (9F2C) Platform at each of the four site locations; Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, FL; NAS Whidbey Island, CA; Naval Station (NS) Norfolk, VA; and NAS Patuxent River, MD.</p>
<p>This competitive effort has identified incidental construction work. The construction element consists of removing the old platforms, preparing the pool surface, and installing the new platforms. The platforms will be made of a non corrosive hard plastic like material. The expectation is that the platforms will be secured to the pool deck using epoxy anchor bolts. Additionally, each of the platforms has an electrical line connected at the base of the platform, which runs up along the side of the platform leading to the controls for the overhead hoist. The electrical connections and controls will be disconnected during removal and reattached to the new platforms.</p>
<p>This notice is for informational purposes only. This is not a request for proposal. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY<br />The purpose of this notice is for the Government to obtain most current information regarding firms interested in and capable of performing the subject project. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is conducting market research to facilitate a determination of acquisition strategy. The determination of acquisition strategy for this acquisition lies solely with the government and will be based on this market research and information available to the government from other sources. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District, is conducting this market research to identify businesses which have the capability to execute the following proposed project:</p>
<p>Scope: Demolish from 2 to 8 Army Family Housing buildings, including foundations and all associated site work, at Fort Greely, Alaska. Fort Greely is located along the Richardson Highway, approximately 100 miles south of Fairbanks Alaska. Fort Greely is near Delta Junction, Alaska which as limited housing and support facilities. The eight buildings are all located in the same general area along Third Street in the Cantonment area of Fort Greely. Each building is a townhouse style eight-plex with approximate 15,000 square footage per building. The buildings were constructed in the 1960s and are spread footing, concrete foundations with wood framing. Six of the buildings have attached garage additions that will also be removed. Hazardous surveys have been conducted, and all the buildings have extensive asbestos, which must be removed before final demolition. Various site work around the buildings will be removed including parking lots, Headbolt outlets, stoops, electrical, utilidors, and sidewalks. The utilidors will be demolished back to the mainlines and are assumed to contain asbestos covered piping. The foundation holes will be filled with classified fill and the area will be graded, receive topsoil and seeded. There will be a 58% diversion goal from landfills for all non-hazardous construction debris. The base landfill will be available for disposal of asbestos material and other Construction waste. The area is next to existing occupied housing areas, so noise, safety, dust, etc. are important to manage on this project.</p>
<p>The construction period is estimated to be approximately 365 days with a notice to proceed anticipated in January 2014. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 562910, Remediation Services, and the related small business size standard is&nbsp;500 Employees.

<p>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This notice also contains a copy of Amendment 0004 which provided information and a Restructured Performance Work Statement to those offerors determined to be in the Competitive Range after the Government's evaluation of all proposals received in response to the RFP. All proposals were evaluated using the evaluation criteria and procedures outlined in the RFP. The Restructured Performance Work Statement contained a revised task structure which would allow the Government to manage the work more efficiently, but the scope of work for the Comprehensive Centers requirement remained fundamentally unchanged from the original Performance Work Statement that was attached to the Comprehensive Centers RFP.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE<br />AFMC ESG 773 ESS/PKB<br />3515 S. General McMullen, Ste 200<br />San Antonio TX 78226-1865<br /><br />II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>The purpose of this Justification and Approval is to award a firm fixed price contract with Dental Assisting National Board, Inc. (DANB), for dental assistant certification testing services. The Air Force Dental Service has approved the administration of certification examinations to students in the Dental Assistant Apprentice Course. National certification is an expressed goal for all Air Force dental assistants, the Infection Control (IC) and Radiation Health and Safety (RHS) examination are two components of national certification. Upon successful completion, students taking these tests in technical school will earn certificates of competency.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>The Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA) SGD Dental is requesting a follow-on, sole source, firm-fixed-price contract for the purchase of DANB certification testing services. The previous sole source, firm-fixed contract, FA7014-08-P-0133 was awarded to Dental Assisting National Board, Inc. The Air Force will need approximately 225 IC and 225 RHS practice exams and certification testing services for Dental Assistant Apprentice Course for selected students each year. The estimated value is XXXXXX per year. The Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) value for a base year contract with four one-year options is XXXXXX</p>
<p>The assigned NAICS Code is 611710, Educational Support Services, with a small business size standard of $14 million.</p>
<p>CLIN/Service Quantity<br />Unit Price Line Total<br />0001- IC EXAMS 225 each XXXXXX XXXXXX<br />0002 - RHS EXAMS 225 each XXXXXX XXXXXX<br />1001 - IC EXAMS 225 each XXXXXX XXXXXX<br />1002 - RHS EXAMS&nbsp; 225 each XXXXXX XXXXXX<br />2001 - IC EXAMS 225 each XXXXXX XXXXXX<br />2002 - RHS EXAMS&nbsp; 225 each XXXXXX XXXXXX<br />3001 - IC EXAMS&nbsp; 225 each XXXXXX XXXXXX<br />3002 - RHS EXAMS 225 each XXXXXX XXXXXX<br />4001 - IC EXAMS 225 each XXXXXX XXXXXX<br />4002 - RHS EXAMS&nbsp; 225 eachXXXXXX XXXXXX<br />GRAND TOTAL XXXXXX</p>
<p>The appropriation is Defense Health Program, Operations and Maintenance, Air Force 0130.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>This requirement may be excluded from full and open competition requirements under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE</p>
<p>DANB is the only agency that is recognized by the American Dental Association and the only agency that provides a nationally recognized certification for dental assistants.</p>
<p>VI. A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>The proposed action will be synopsized and posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) in accordance with FAR 5.207, noting that pursuant to FAR 5.102(e) the Government only need provide copies of a solicitation issued under other than full and open competition to firms requesting copies that were not initially solicited, but only after advising the requester of the determination to limit the solicitation to a specified firm or firms as authorized. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>A price analysis will be accomplished using available publicly posted pricing to determine price fair and reasonable. Comparison to the publicly posted pricing is indicative of the current market price for these exams and certification. In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b)(3) and (c)(3), a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data will not be required at conclusion of negotiations.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>Market research was conducted February 2013 by the AF technical expert, Dental Career Field Manager, CMSgt Carolyn A. Regan.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) Soctt Field Office has issued modification P00041 to contract HC1013-04-C-5001 for the Verizon Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) Contract. This is a Sole Source Firm Fixed Price contract.
<p>The purpose of this modification to deploy Next Generation Networks (NGN) Priority Service (PS) enhancements to Verizon's Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) infrastructure to support national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications. The current contract was awarded for a 1 year base period plus nine 1 year options and expires on 28 February 2014. The effort being proposed requires a modification to the period of performance because Verizon requires 12 months from the award of this contract modification to complete implementation of the NGN PS enhancements. The new period of performance would extend to 26 Sep 2014 for this effort only.</p>

<DESC>LIMITED SOURCE NOTICE<br />The Indian Health Service, Nashville Area Office (IHS/NAO) has enacted a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) with DT-TRAK Consulting Inc. of 210 North Broadway, Miller, South Dakota 57362. This notice is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6 (a) (1) (i) (A).
<p>The immediate necessity for billing, accounts receivable, and compliance auditing is required for the Catawba Service Unit whereas the former functions are not being fulfilled and starting to cause delays in service for patients. It is therefore; recognized by this ordering activity that further delays will be incurred as a result of not filling the duties as soon as possible to keep a clear record of patients without backlogged filings that could disrupt the timely flow of healthcare as is in accordance with FAR 8. 405-6 (a) (1) (i) (A).</p>
<p>Secondly, it is in the interest of economy, efficiency, and will promote small business interests as we currently have two staffing BPA's from GSA Schedule small business entities. This third staffing source will compliment and aid in diversifying funding through three different staffing agencies to lower the overall concentration of funding expended through this activity which is in the Nation's interest. This diversification interest is further fulfilling the mission of the IHS as a "Buy Indian" procurement in which the new BPA vendor is listed as a "Native American Owned" entity.</p>
