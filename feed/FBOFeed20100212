<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: ELINT COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND EXPLOITATION <br />ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial Announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #10-02 RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to employ emerging technologies to develop and demonstrate automated, real-time signal detection, processing, exploitation, and reporting capabilities of existing and emerging Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) signals and their associated Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) information in support of ground and airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance platforms. Applicable technologies will be used to: (1) Enhance collection system efficiency to include multi-platform collection optimization and management; (2) Automate digital signal processing hardware and software processes to enable a man-on-the-loop concept to address the increased volume of data and increased time criticality of analysis, both necessary to support Effects Based Operations of the future; and (3) Dynamically characterize and correlate databases that use existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Target characteristic identification/ correlation; (2) Automated collection, signal ID sorting and first level processing; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing/analysis technology at both the Operational/Tactical and Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&amp;TI) levels; (4) Software aboard Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives; (5) Advanced knowledge-based processing techniques; and (6) Multi-sensor/multi-processor collection management.</p>
<p>Detailed scope and definition of problems are as follows: (1) Target characteristic identification/ correlation: Battlefield management depends heavily on ELINT and Electronic Warfare (EW) assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources. One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation which is normally a "brute-force/labor intensive" effort: (2) Automated collection, signal identification (ID) sorting and first level processing. Dense, hard-to-get, advanced modulated, and Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board / off-board assets. This area should also allow for the improvement in signal sorting and identification, discrimination (&lsquo;flagging') of out-of-limits signals, especially threat systems whose measurable values can readily be characterized. Continual high-resolution sampling of Intermediate Frequency Modulation (IFM), pulse sorting, and de-interleaving processes using &lsquo;fingerprinting' techniques should continue to be investigated as a means to support flagging and automated tracking efforts and Signal identification algorithms for next generation target radars. (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing: Environment complexity, as well as advanced collection hardware technology, demands growth in the digital ELINT processing arena. Efforts should take into consideration current analysis technology available, reduction in processing of routine activity allowing time to be spent on more critical tasks, methods employing horizontal, parallel processing, and how best to insert these solution(s) into existing systems. (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives: Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms. Host processing systems will be low power and weight so the resident software processing systems will need to employ a digital receiver and processing schema that operate modularly, in parallel, and in firmware. (5) Advanced Knowledge-Based Processing Techniques: Timely and accurate decision support to the warfighter require innovative knowledge-base processing for sensor management, emitter ID, flagging, and SIGINT fusion to include but not limited to techniques for automated knowledge acquisition and knowledge modeling, real-time inference, and real-time operating system. (6) Multi-sensor/multi-processor collection management: Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect LPI/difficult waveform signals. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include but not be limited to multi-platform signal correlation and multi-int sensor cueing. Attention should be paid to fusing the sensor measurements and network data bandwidth to support collection management. Deliverables will include technical reports and, when appropriate, demonstrations.</p>

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror's approach demonstrates overall scientific and technical merit for the development and/or enhancement of the technology, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIEG will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at a time of award.

<a href="mailto:jessica.gaskins@us.army.mil">CECOM Contracting Center (CECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>The United States Army CECOM Contracting Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010, intends to award a sole source contract to L-3 Communications, Titan Corporation, Linkabit Division (L-3), 3033 Science Park Road, San Diego, CA 92121-1101, IAW the authority of 10 U. S. C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 for Only One Responsible Source.  The resulting contract will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract for the procurement of twelve (12) Prophet Controls (PCs), AN/MSW-24 Data Analysis Centrals, and associated spare parts.  There will be no options included in this contract.  The PC tasks the Prophet Sensors for data collection and reporting.  The PC transmits and receives formatted reports to and from the Divisions Analysis and Control Element and the Brigades Analysis Control Team, and provides a near real-time graphical display of collected information. To optimize its collection capabilities, the PC uses the Single SIGINT Software Baseline (S3B) to transfer information to and from the Prophet Sensors in a coordinated manner that enhances its utility to the Warfighters. L-3 is the only source with an operational production line for the PC and its associated spare parts and, therefore, can meet the required deliveries of equipment within 4 months after contract award. It is estimated that a system developed by any other source would require that source to perform an extensive Non-Recurring Engineering effort to design, integrate, and produce a system. Testing of the new system would then need to be performed and this would result in delivery delays of approximately one year. This synopsis is provided for informational purposes only and is not to be considered a request for proposal; however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. The POCs for this acquisition are Willie Dimuel (410) 417-0083 and Jessica Gaskins (410) 417- 0084.  Solicitation Number W15P7T-10-R-P402 will be issued on or about 02 March 2010. The US Army CECOM Contracting Command has established an Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) website to allow electronic transmittal of Request for Proposals (RFPs) from CECOM to Industry.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;Synopsis</p>
<p>RECOVERY - Proposals from all business concerns will be accepted for the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Design-Build (D-B) Project PRA-DEWA 14(13), Solicitation Number DTFH71-10-R-00008, located in Dingman Township in Pike County, Pennsylvania. This D-B project includes the design and reconstruction of the Raymondskill Creek Bridge on U.S. Route 209 at milepost 18; it consists of replacing the existing superstructure with a 4-inch Latex Modified Concrete (LMC) overlay, new approach slabs, abutment seats, and suitable wingwall and abutment repairs. Miscellaneous work will include placing engineered riprap at the north and south abutments to counteract scour, removing debris from the channel, removing vegetation growth throughout the structure, replacing the existing guardrail, structural transitions, and terminal sections, and minimal approach work. The proposed project limits are within existing National Park Service (NPS) right-of-way.</p>
<p>The substructure will not be replaced and additional investigation is required to determine if the abutments and foundations require strengthening through the use of tiebacks and/or underpinning. The bridge was constructed in 1955 and consists of reinforced concrete abutments and wingwalls supporting fourteen 36-inch x 27-inch pre-stressed concrete adjacent box beams overlaid with a cast-in-place concrete deck and bituminous paving. The bridge spans about 52 feet and provides a clear deck width of 40.5 feet. The bridge shoulders are lined with concrete curbs and galvanized steel structure-mounted guiderail. No as-builts are available. The roadway approaches are on a horizontally curved alignment and the bridge superstructure is superelevated to accommodate the curvature.</p>
<p>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance Categorical Exclusion (CE) has been completed by the FHWA. Only proposals that comply with the requirements outlined in the CE will be accepted; proposals that include the replacement of the entire structure will be rejected. The requirements of this D-B project will include the application and acquisition of all environmental permits required for construction.<br /><br />The design and construction cost for this D-B project is expected to fall within the price range of $1,000,000 to $3,000,000. The project at this time is "Subject to Availability of Funding". This project will be partially funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).</p>
<p>In accordance with Public Law 104-106 (41 U.S.C. 253m), the Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration is conducting a "two phased" D-B selection process for the National Park Service. Solicitation documents for Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), should be issued on or about February 25, 2010. Qualifications due date and location will be specified on the SF 1442 to the EFLHD office in Sterling, Virginia.</p>
<p>A selection committee will review and evaluate contractor qualifications and select two or more of the most highly qualified D-B firms/teams based on the established RFQ evaluation criteria to participate in Phase Two of this D-B selection process. During Phase Two, those firms/teams short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will outline the remainder of the process requirements.</p>
<p>Use Internet address: https://www.fbo.gov/ (at QUICK SEARCH, type "EFLHD" and all available projects will be listed) to check for availability of bid documents. All bid documents can be directly downloaded from this website. Documents will no longer be mailed.

<SUBJECT>Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Follow-On Study
<SOLNBR>NIH-NHLBI-HC-15A-10-07
<RESPDATE>030110
<CONTACT>Cheryl A Jennings, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-0347, Fax (301) 480-3430, Email cj19f@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH intends to negotiate on a non-competitive, sole source basis with Wake Forest University, the Coordinating Center for the Action to control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) to award a Follow-On Study. The cited authority is 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This effort will be a five-year follow-up of the ACCORD clinical trial participants.  This contractor has been involved in the recruitment, treatment strategies, follow-up, collection and analysis of data, and reporting of results on 10,251 participants from seven clinical networks across the United States and Canada. The incumbent contractor has the unique capability to provide these required services to NHLBI for the follow-up of the study.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study. The objectives of the study are detailed below.

Background and Purpose of the ACCORD Trial: About 24 million people (almost 8% of the U.S. population) have diabetes, which costs the nation an estimated $174 billion annually.  People with type 2 diabetes have 2-4 times the rate of major cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared to those without diabetes.  With increasing diabetes rates in the nation, the attributable risk of CVD due to diabetes is increasing.

The goal of the ACCORD trial is to address this public health challenge by testing three complementary medical treatment strategies to enhance the options for reducing CVD rates in people with diabetes. ACCORD is a randomized, multicenter, factorially designed clinical trial in 10, 000 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus conducted in 77 clinical sites across the U.S. and Canada.  The current infrastructure comprises 7 clinical networks, one coordinating center, a central laboratory, an ECG reading center, and a Drug Distribution Center. The trial has been ongoing since September 30, 1999. Wake Forest has been the coordinating center since then.

The trial was designed to test the effects on major CVD events of a therapeutic strategy to control glycemia to near-normal levels (target HbA1c < 6%) compared to a standard strategy (target HbA1c between 6% and 7%), of fibrates added to statins  (compared to statins alone) to increase HDL-cholesterol and lower triglycerides in the context of good LDL-C control, and of intensive BP control targeting the normal range (SBP< 120 mmHg) compared to a standard BP control strategy (SBP between 130 and 140 mmHg).  All 10,251 participants are in the glycemia trial; 5,518 are in the lipid trial and 4,733 are in the BP trial. The primary outcome for all 3 trials is first occurrence of a major CVD event (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CVD death). The trial included substudies on the investigation of the effects of the treatment strategies on cognition (the MIND substudy); on retinopathy and its progression over time (the EYE substudy); and the Health Quality of Life substudy. Each of these substudies involved substantial fractions of the overall ACCORD study participants. The recruitment phase was completed September 30, 2005 when the study surpassed their goal of 10,000 participants and recruited 10,251 participants.  In February, 2008, the ACCORD Glycemia protocol was modified due to safety concerns. All participants in the intensive Glycemia intervention arm were transitioned into the standard Glycemia treatment arm. The protocol remained otherwise unchanged with follow up continuing as planned until June 30, 2009.  After  June 30, 2009 all patients who give consent will have telephone only follow-up visits every six months (up to December 31, 2010) to assess the occurrence of major cardiovascular events

ACCORD Follow-On Study Objectives:  A 5-year observational ACCORD follow-on study is anticipated from September 30, 2010 through September 29, 2015.  During this time, all ACCORD participants will be invited to provide informed consent for continued follow-up measurements.  An estimated 92% of the original 10,251 participants is anticipated to be available for follow-up, based on current numbers of deaths, losses-to-follow-up, and refusals.

 

The follow-on will determine whether differences seen during the study in mortality, CVD events, and microvascular diseases persist or change over time and whether other differences emerge. The goals of the follow-up phase is to obtain key clinical, biological and ECG data that are similar in quality to those obtained during the trial period to enable examination of trends over time.  Examining morbidity and mortality from both macrovascular and microvascular diseases will provide a complete picture regarding long-term vascular outcomes from diabetes and the impact of glucose, blood pressure lowering, and lipid treatment on those outcomes. The follow-on phase will consist of periodic clinic visits for data collection and interim phone contacts to obtain information about clinical events.  Clinic visits would use streamlined approaches from current methods to obtain key clinically-relevant data that are the most important measures for the glycemia, BP, and lipid trials. Information to be collected would be detailed by investigators but is envisioned as including the following:  BP; medications; blood for HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, lipids, and creatinine; and urine for creatinine and albumin.  As currently, a central laboratory would conduct biological specimen analyses. ECGs would be obtained to identify silent myocardial infarctions, and clinical events would be adjudicated.  A specific protocol will be developed upon award.

It is anticipated that the National Eye Institute will continue funding an Eye substudy and that the National Institute on Aging will continue a cognitive substudy, and that the CDC will continue a Health Related Quality of Life substudy, as these substudies provide important clinical information.

The Coordinating Centers expected responsibilities that will continue during the follow on phase include (but are not limited to) all data management and analysis activities including the documentation and maintenance of appropriate confidentiality and security of files for the study and substudies; lead the development of the protocol and manuals of procedures development; monitor the regulatory aspects of the study; establish standardized quality of data gathering; continue to maintain a morbidity/mortality monitoring and adjudication system; maintain quality control and monitoring of the performance status of the clinical sites; solicit and monitor core laboratories such as central ECG and  chemistry laboratory; coordinate, arrange, participate in, and provide any information necessary for regular Steering Committee, Observations Study Monitoring Board, training and other necessary study meetings; and provide technical reports as required by the Government (up to one quarterly and a final).

The contract will require an extensive comparison of the ongoing clinical trial study, which will cover the activities above.  We anticipate subcontracting opportunities during the course of this contract.  For instance, there will be a need to establish an ECG Reading Center and a Laboratory Center.
 
This notice of intent expires 15-days from its posting. This is not a request for proposals (RFP). The estimated award date is December 1, 2010.  All responsible sources may submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants. Any interested parties in this or potential subcontracting opportunities may contact, Cheryl A. Jennings, Contracting Officer, cj19f@nih.gov, 301-435-0347.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme,California, has the requirement for the effort to merge Assessment Systemfor Hazard Surveys (ASHS) and Munitions Survivability Software (MSS)software capabilities into the Explosives Safety Siting (ESS) softwaremodule as well as to develop additional functionality not available in anyof the software programs.  Specific tasks are identified in the AutomatedExplosives Safety Site Planning Requirements Document (ASPRD) and in Section5 of this document.  The ESS software will be expanded to includeexpeditionary site planning tools provided in the ASHS and MSS softwarepackages.  Additional graphical data layers that can easily be created byusers and extensive graphical editing commands will be added to allow usersto create or update maps to account for rapidly changing circumstances inthe field.  Special tools will be added to allow the user to automate the siting offacilities represented by complex graphics.  For example, measured distancesbetween an above-ground magazine may be different, depending on whether thefacility being sited is a potential explosive site (PES), or an exposed site(ES).  Additional tools will be provided to allow quick and accurate sitingof new facilities inside of existing development constraints and to accountfor reduced separation distances provided by barricade protection.
New geospatial tools will be developed to assist a user to compare andupdate maps as they change over time.  Tools will be provided to closelytrack changes to data so that configuration management is not lost whenedits are made to copies of the 'official' map of record at any DoDinstallation.  Extensive wizard help commands and training aids will be developed toassist users to quickly become proficient with the use of the software andto recall how to execute software commands when the software hasn't beenused for an extended period of time.
A standardized site approval submittal package format will be developed thatwill be the same for all Military Services.  Tools for identifying andmitigating rule violations will be developed to allow the user to overrideviolations as justified by Engineering Analyses, Terrain analysis, RiskAnalysis, Grandfather Clauses, or other rationale.
Prior to submitting a proposal please complete the Non-Disclosure statement(see attachment) and electronically submit to the Naval FacilitiesEngineering Service Center, Phil Wager (e-mail phillip.wager@navy.mil) for acopy of the ESS Source Code.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development in Nicaragua requires the services of a contractor to implement a comprehensive three-year local governance program (hereafter referred to as the Program) with an optional two-year extension period. The purpose of the program will be to help municipal governments improve the delivery of basic public services to their constituents. The program will support three main objectives: 1) helping local governments become more accountable, more competent at the core tasks of governance, and more capable of managing public resources, 2) supporting citizens to more effectively engage with municipal governments in order to influence decision making and demand accountability and transparency, and 3) the implementation of municipal services and infrastructure projects.
<p>&nbsp;This program seeks to leverage significant counterpart contributions from local governments and other public and private institutions. The contractor will achieve the objectives through several modalities, including technical assistance and training, grants and subcontracts in targeted geographic areas of assistance, and establishment of a competitive grants fund open to municipal governments and civil society organizations nationwide.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.</p>
<p>Any information taken from other publications is used at the sole risk of the offeror. The procuring office cannot guarantee the accuracy of information contained in other publications.</p>
<p>All questions must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Diana McLain either by email: diana.mclain@gsa.gov or phone number is 215-446-5776.</p>
<p>*** This is NOT a request for proposals and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.***</p>

Interested sources shall also be able to design and provide in large quantities brochure type materials to be handed to visitors during the shows.  Interested sources must have a storage facility large enough to store the Government owned booth, as required, that is climate and humidity controlled throughout the year so that no damage shall occur to the equipment.  The firms location is required to be within a 30-mile radius to Picatinny, NJ to accommodate accessibility of stored display items for selection or inspection purposes which can be under strict time constraints.  Due to short lead times, an in-house manufacturing facility is necessary at the contractor site.   The PM-MAS booth is a Laarhoven product; as such, interested vendors should be very familiar with this product line and respond accordingly with their experience with Laarhoven products. This synopsis is open to all business concerns; however, in accordance with FAR 19.501, the Governments intent is to establish Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) with small businesses. In the event there aren't enough responses from responsible, capable small businesses, then large business responses will be accepted.  All interested and potential firms must be registered in CCR, and current firms must update once a year to maintain active status.  Please visit the CCR website to register and update, https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx  . Whether applying for assistance awards, contracts, or other business opportunities, all entities are considered "registrants".  Registration in no way guarantees that a contract or assistance award will be awarded.  The following information is required to register in CCR: DUNS Number; Tax Identification Number (TIN) and Taxpayers Name; Statistical Information about your business; Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Information.  Once a business has been registered in CCR, it also has to be registered in ORCA, https://orca.bpn.gov/.  On the left side of the CCR web page there is a link to ORCA. Firms/companies are invited to indicate their interests and capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, information pertaining to experience on previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing the following:<BR><BR>"	Cartridge, 40mm, Ground Marker, Red Smoke M713 NSN 1310-00-541-6150 <BR>"	Cartridge, 40mm, Ground Marker, Green Smoke M715 NSN 1310-00-541-6152 <BR>"	Cartridge, 40mm, Ground Marker, Yellow Smoke M716 NSN 1310-00-541-6153 <BR><BR>The NAICS Code for this announcement is 332993, Ammunition (Except Small Arms) Manufacturing. The applicable small business size standard is 1,500 employees.<BR><BR>The difference among the three models listed above is the color of smoke. The cartridges consist of a cartridge case, a projectile with pyrotechnic smoke payload, and a pyrotechnic impact fuze. The cartridge case is a dual-chambered aluminum container housing a brass propellant cup. The propellant cup is held in the case by a crimped base plug which provides a pressure-type waterproof seal. The base plug houses a percussion primer. The projectiles utilize a one-piece aluminum body and a zinc alloy base. The payload consists of a pyrotechnic smoke mixture pressed into the body with a cylindrical cavity in the center. The fuze protrudes into the cylindrical cavity of the smoke mixture and is staked to the base of the projectile. The fuze is designed to function at a maximum of 19 seconds after launching or upon impact. <BR><BR>Upon firing, the primer ignites the propelling charge. In turn, the projectile is accelerated down the launcher barrel where a spin of 3,750 rpm is imparted by the barrel rifling and a muzzle velocity of approximately 247  7 fps is obtained. In addition to launching the projectile, the propellant gases ignite the first fire mixture of the fuze in the base of the projectile. The first fire mixture ignites a high-temperature transfer mixture contained in the delay assembly. After 19 seconds, burning of a delay through the delay housing ignites the smoke mixture. If impact occurs before 19 seconds, the delay housing breaks and the burning portion flies forward out of the fuze support, contacting and igniting the pyrotechnic smoke mixture. Ignition of the smoke mixture causes a buildup of pressure which dislodges the fuze support at the aft end of the projectile, thus allowing smoke to be emitted at the aft end of the projectile. In the event the fuze fails to function upon impact, the output mixture provided in the front end of the delay housing acts as a backup to the impact feature. When the flame reaches this point, the output mixture flashes and ignites the smoke mixture. <BR><BR>The Technical Data Packages (TDPs) for the 40mm Colored Smoke Cartridge Ground Markers are currently classified as Distribution X, which means they cannot be distributed via the Internet. Further, export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. 2751 et seq) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C. App 2401 et seq. Dissemination shall be in accordance with the provisions of DoD Directive 5230.25. Violations of the aforementioned export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Distribution of these TDPs is only authorized to U.S. agencies and private individuals or enterprises eligible to obtain export-controlled technical data in accordance with regulations implementing 10 U.S.C. 140c. A Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, DD Form 2345, certified by the Defense Logistics Services Center, Battle Creek, MI is required. Restricted technical data shall not be forwarded without express permission from the Government POC(s) listed in this announcement. <BR><BR>In order to receive the TDPs, a copy of the executed DD Form 2345, along with the contractors current CAGE code, complete mailing address, and the name/phone number of the individual who is to receive the TDPs is required to be submitted to Sarah Herrera, sarah.e.herrera@us.army.mil and Adam Elmore, adam.j.elmore@us.army.mil.

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for market research purposes.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541618, Other Management Consulting Services. ALL BUSINESS SIZES ARE WELCOME TO RESPOND TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.</p>
<p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is seeking businesses that can provide 360 - Degree Assessment and Feedback services. The 360 - Degree Assessment is a process that collects confidential performance information from multiple perspectives to identify individual and team strengths and developmental areas.</p>
<p>The 360 degree assessment is for approximately 33 managers in its organization and&nbsp;approximately 240 staff and the FERC has approximately 1,300 staff. The managers for which the 360 assessment will be conducted are at the Senior Executive Service and GS-15 level. The mission of OEMR is to serve the public interest by providing leadership and vision in promoting competitive energy markets and ensuring just and reasonable rates, terms and conditions of service in natural gas pipeline, oil pipeline and electric power markets.</p>
<p>The component deliverables of the 360 degree assessment are: <br />&bull;training workshop for the managers participating in this 360 degree assessment; and,<br />&bull;on-line assessment administration performed for each manager; <br />&bull;individual assessment analysis and office assessment analysis<br />&bull;follow-up coaching session for managers.</p>
<p>The objective of the 360 degree assessment is to provide a basis for increased leadership development for OEMR managers. A description of these work items is detailed below.</p>
<p>The first element of the 360 degree assessment is a training workshop for OEMR managers participating in this assessment process. The content of the workshop should address these issues: goals of the 360 degree assessment, confidentiality of completing the survey by the participants, methods used in administering the process, instructions on completing the survey and how the results of the survey will be used.</p>
<p>The second element is the on-line assessment survey. For the administration of the survey we anticipate it will involve 8-10 participants completing the survey for each manager. It should be noted that the OEMR leadership model is closely aligned with the OPM competencies model and the survey design and questionnaire should reflect those OPM competencies. The overall design of the survey instrument should allow the rater to include examples and comments for the manager as it relates to the question. Please discuss the benefits and costs of allowing the rater to include examples and comments for the manager as it relates to specific questions within the survey instrument.</p>
<p>The third element is an analysis of the results of the survey provided through a set of reports. The reports will consist of a general analysis of the overall survey results of the managers in OEMR as well as separate reports providing an individual analysis for each manager. <br /><br />The fourth and final element for the 360 degree assessment is a second workshop held to address the overall findings of the survey with the managers in OEMR.</p>
<p>An option for consideration is a follow-up individual coaching session for each manager. In preparing your response allocate between 1-2 hours for each individual coaching session, or propose a different amount of time and explain why that would be more effective. The coaching sessions should include a review of the manger's individual survey results, suggestions on improvement and building on current skills.</p>
<p>In addition, for each manager, provide options for an individual developmental plan (IDP). When preparing your reponse include the coaching sessions and IDP development as separate in the assessment.</p>

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Laboratory & Environmental Testing Inc., 3501 Berrywood Dr., Columbia, MO to provide Analytical Services on the following:  analyses for suite of trace elements in water samples using ICP-AES, analysis for selected individual trace elements in tissue samples, and homogenization (grinding) of biological tissue samples.  This requirement is for a five (5) year Blanket Purchase Agreement. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement. 
The USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC) regularly conducts toxicological and biological assessments of aquatic samples. Timely chemical measurements are often an integral part of such assessments, and most of these are typically performed by the CERC Environmental Chemistry Branch. However, occasionally some analyses cannot be performed internally because of conflicts among project priorities or sudden equipment breakdowns. Consequently, small numbers of samples must sometimes be submitted to an outside analytical laboratory in order to meet CERC project timelines. Services needed most often include: a) analysis of water samples for a suite of elemental constituents by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and b) sample homogenization of large biological specimens (primarily fish). 
Currently, Laboratory and Environmental Testing, Incorporated (L.E.T.), Columbia, Missouri, is the only area laboratory qualified to provide the needed services with a proven track record in dealing with DOl agencies (the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for example). Furthermore, L.E.T., Incorporated has performed water analyses for the past 2 years for an ongoing CERC project on the Missouri River. To ensure comparability with past data, water sample analyses scheduled for FY07 as part of this project should be analyzed by the same laboratory.
Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.

<SUBJECT>WLM 175' KEEPER CLASS ULSTEIN Z-DRIVE MAINTENANCE
<SOLNBR>HSCG40-10-R-WLMZD
<RESPDATE>030510

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for propulsion system maintenance, technical and logistic support and training for Ulstein Model 1350H Marine Thruster Z-Drives in Coast Guard stock and installed aboard 175' WLM Keeper class buoy tenders.
<p>The Coast Guard's Surface Forces Logistics Command (SFLC), Icebreaker, Buoy and Construction Tender product line (IBCT), is interested in determining what sources are able to provide such maintenance, support and training.</p>
<p>General specifications of the units to be overhauled and equipment overview:</p>
<p>Model No.: 1350H<br />Rating: 745kw (999 HP) @ 1600 RPM<br />Ration (Viewed Input Hub Face): Clockwise-Starboard Unit; Counter-Clockwise Port Unit<br />Propeller Speed: 403 RPM<br />Dry Weight: 27,000 lbs</p>
<p>Note: here and hereafter in this notice, when reference is made to a Z-Drive, thruster or unit, it shall be considered to include the attached propeller and shipping skid, total weight approximately 56,000 lbs.</p>
<p>Total number of installed thrusters: 28 EA on 14 separate Keeper class buoy tenders.<br />Total number of spare thrusters in Coast Guard supply system: 4 EA<br />Location of Keeper class buoy tenders: 3 West Coast; 11 East Coast.</p>
<p>The Keeper class buoy tenders' main propulsion system consists of two (Port &amp; Starboard) through-hull, steerable Ulstein Model 1350H Z-Drives. Though basically a commercial Ulstein model, those in the Coast Guard inventory were designed during vessel construction to be specifically integrated into the Keeper class vessel configuration. Consequently, the units in the Coast Guard inventory have some unique design features that do not appear in commercial thrusters of that model.</p>
<p>OVERHAUL DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Each Z-Drive shall be overhauled in accordance with a detailed specification mandating use of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Standards, Processes, Procedures and OEM-certified new or requalified/rebuilt parts/assemblies. The overhaul will include the following sequential steps:</p>
<p>a. Performing a full equipment inventory to insure completeness of unit</p>
<p>b. Cleaning the Z-Drive in preparation for disassembly</p>
<p>c. Disassembling the Z-Drive to component level, performing further cleaning and NDT, measuring and recording dimensional attributes, propeller condition, validating configuration, assessing condition of beveled gear sets and submitting a detailed Pre-Overhaul Inspection Report that includes overhaul recommendations, labor/material/parts costs, and estimated overhaul completion interval.</p>
<p>d. Overhauling/replacing components/assemblies as authorized by the Coast Guard</p>
<p>e. Reassembling the Z-Drive and submit a Post Overhaul Inspection Report</p>
<p>f. Performing an acceptance Spin test and completing a final gear contact pattern inspection jointly with a Coast Guard QA representative</p>
<p>g. Preserving, packaging, packing, and marking the Z-drive in preparation for shipment</p>
<p>TECHNICAL AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT:</p>
<p>a. As required, and both remotely or onsite, provide OEM engineering analysis and consultation for Z-Drive maintenance and casualty repair.</p>
<p>b. As required, provide OEM field engineering support to oversee installation of overhauled Z-Drives aboard Coast Guard buoy tenders.</p>
<p>c. Provide continuous stream of OEM-generated technical recommendations regarding upgrades, part substitutions, maintenance practices and processes. Notify the Coast Guard of long lead-time part concerns.</p>
<p>d. As required, provide OEM-certified new or requalified/rebuilt parts/assemblies to SFLC IBCT or homeported or deployed buoy tenders.</p>
<p>TRAINING SUPPORT FOR COAST GUARD ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS:</p>
<p>a. As required, and both remotely and onsite, provide OEM-qualified maintenance, operational and diagnostic training to shore and vessel based Coast Guard units.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED QUANTITIES:</p>
<p>The Coast Guard projects a requirement to overhaul a total of six (06) Z-Drives each year consisting of three (03) port and three (03) starboard units. This estimate is based primarily on the increasing failure rate experienced due to the age and operating hours on the equipment.</p>
<p>The number of OEM technical representative onsite visits to support &amp; oversee installation of Z-Drives is three (3) per year. The number of OEM technical representative onsite visits to support engineering analysis and consultation for Z-Drive maintenance and casualty repair is three (3) per year. The number of OEM technical representative onsite visits to support training requirements is three (3) per year.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED OVERHAUL PERIOD FOR EACH Z-DRIVE:</p>
<p>The expected overhaul interval for each Z-Drive overhaul is approximately 4-6 months. This estimate is based on previous experience and presumes that required OEM parts will be readily available.<br /><br />EXPECTED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>SFLC anticipates Z-Drive overhaul and technical support needs will be incorporated into a firm fixed-price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity delivery order contract with a base contract year and four (4) contract option years.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL AND LICENSING BARRIERS/LIMITS:</p>
<p>The Coast Guard was unable to obtain, and/or the systems manufacturers were unwilling to furnish, complete detailed technical &amp; engineering data specific to the Ulstein Model 1350H Z-Drives during the acquisition phase of the 175' WLM platform program. Consequently, critical dimensional and tolerance information remains proprietary to Rolls Royce Canada, Ltd, the current OEM. This has precluded SFLC and its predecessor organization from promoting alternative overhaul sources or even developing organic repair capabilities within the fleet maintenance network. As such, the Coast Guard believes that only Rolls Royce Canada, Ltd. can satisfy this requirement. However, alternate sources believing they possess the necessary expertise, technical data, resources, and capabilities to meet the Coast Guard's specific Z-Drive overhaul and technical support requirements outlined above are encouraged to submit statements of capability for review/consideration.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF CAPABILITY FORMAT AND CONTENT:</p>
<p>Responses from both large and small businesses are considered at this time.</p>
<p>Address your ability to provide OEM support as addressed in the above paragraphs. Provide information concerning any licensing rights you possess on the listed equipment or with regard to OEM technical and logistical support.</p>
<p>Provide references to equivalent type of work performed in the past five (5) years (provide customer contract number, company or POC name and phone number.)</p>
<p>Indicate your company business size and status (i.e. 8(a), SDVOSB, etc.).</p>
<p>Capability Statement limit is five (5) pages. Send electronically to Jim Altice at james.s.altice@uscg.mil<br />All Capability Statements shall be received at this address no later than 12:00 p.m. (EST) on 05 March 2010 and shall reference HSCG40-10-R-WLMZD on both the email subject line and on the submitted documents.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to search for qualified vendors capable of making the necessary changes to the Veterans Administration's Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) interface and workflow to allow tracking and reporting of critical diagnostic test alerts and follow-up actions taken by providers. The motivation for the "Innovation from the Field for Alerts Reengineering" project is the lack of appropriate alert tracking mechanisms within CPRS.

This purchase will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 13.501(a) (1) (ii), Test Program for Commercial Items.

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES

CLINs: 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004 and 0005
Description: The MBU-20/P oxygen mask system contains a separate inhalation and exhalation valve.  The separate oxygen valves require the oxygen delivery hose to be offset from the center of the mask.  The inhalation and exhalation valves are interconnected by a compensation tube.  The compensation tube senses inhalation pressure and a portion is directed to the underside of the exhalation valve plate.  The compensation pressure keeps the exhalation valve shut during inhalation.  The mask incorporates microphone to allow crewmembers to communicate.  The communication process interfaces with the HGU-55/P helmet and with the aircraft intercommunication system.  The MBU-20/P oxygen mask comes in five sizes.  We are requesting 20 each small narrow, 70 each medium narrow, 70 each medium wide, 30 each large wide, and 10 each extra small narrow.  
SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:

Gentex Corporation is the sole source manufacturer of the USAF MBU-20/P mask.  Gentex  Corporation is capable in providing immediate assistance in constructing the masks required to outfit the new Aircrew Flight Equipment section located in Pensacola, Florida.  Gentex Corporation is unique in constructing and providing all baseline parts to build and maintain the masks in accordance with USAF technical data.  The masks are equipped with an inhalation valve, exhalation valve, compensation tube, oxygen hose, three prong connector, microphone, communication cor  d, and bayonets, all which are essential in flying operations. The MBU-20/P oxygen mask is the only mask which has been tested to provide the absolute essential safety requirements for our aircrew. Any and all replacement parts of the MBU-20/P oxygen mask is ordered through Gentex Corporation.  The USAF technical order, TO 14P3-1-161 outlines the precise inspection  and maintenance procedures for this particular type of mask only.  The MBU-20/P oxygen mask manufactured by Gentex exceeds the requirement of any other off-the-shelf            oxygen mask which can be purchased.  The MBU-20/P oxygen mask is constructed for           USAF military pilots only. The oxygen mask provides a unique system which can be            transferred from trainer type aircraft to fighter aircraft in a matter of seconds.

<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command NorthwestSafety Symposium
The NAVFAC Northwest Safety Symposium is being held at the Naval Undersea Museum, Keyport, Washington on March 11, 2010 from 8:00am to 4:00pm.  The attire for this event is business casual.     While the overall mishap rates for NAVFAC Northwest employees and our contractor partners are much lower than industry averages, in recent months we have experienced numerous significant near misses on our contract work sites, including a severe safety mishap.  NAVFAC Northwest seeks to collaborate with our construction partners on best management practices to improve overall safety awareness and safety performance.
During the full day symposium, we will have discussions centered on maintaining a safe working environment.  Contractor partners will speak on their experiences with sustaining a successful safety program and share innovative safety methodologies.  We will also discuss ways NAVFAC currently defines standards of safety performance used by source selection boards and ways we might improve the process for future acquisitions.  Time will be allotted for a facilitated discussion. Through open and frank discussion, we will reaffirm our mutual commitment to safety on our jobsites as well as openly share innovative ideas between government and contractor partners
Firms are limited to two representatives per company as space is limited.  Target representation is the company principle and a safety professional.  Although seating is not reserved, we are requesting an email confirming attendance.  Those desiring to attend are requested to email Nora Tabafunda at nora.tabafunda@navy.mil.  Directions to the venue will be provided upon request.

<DESC>The purpose of this sole-source synopsis is to announce the revision of the contract maximum order amount on the Enterprise Information Technology Contract (EITC) contract supporting the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). USZA22-02-D-0017 with L-3 Services, Inc. (originally BTG, Inc./novation to L-3 Comm Titan Corp./name change to L-3 Services, Inc.) was awarded under full and open competition in April 2002 as a Single Award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with an anticipated period of performance through 31 March 2011. The contract provides critical Information Technology (IT) support to HQ USSOCOM, its Components, Theater Special Operation Commands (TSOCs) and the Services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps) that have, or provide, direct support to Special Operations Forces (SOF). The work performed by the contractor includes, but is not limited to, Local Area Network Administration, Network Management, Disaster Recovery, Helpdesk, IT Planning, Integration, Information Assurance, Configuration Management, Infrastructure, Hardware Maintenance, Desktop, IT Training, Web/Portal Administration and Development, Database Administration and Development, Application Development, Transmission Security, Technology Refreshment, and spare/repair parts. To continue this critical support, it is necessary to increase the maximum order amount of this contract by $150M (from $1.3B to $1.45B), with an additional $65M of ceiling availability to be invoked in the event the Government exercises the Extension of Services clause. The proposed contract action does not extend the current period of performance. This action is necessary due to an increase in contract requirements in response to the expansion of USSOCOM's operational tempo as it prosecutes Overseas Contingency Operations.
<p>The competitive acquisition for the follow-on to this contract began in September 2009 (reference Request for Information (RFI) number H92222-09-SITEC (SOF (Special Operations Forces) Information Technology Enterprise Contract(s) (SITEC)).</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responses received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.</p>
<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) ( )In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)</p>
<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;</p>
<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>
<p>(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>
<p>(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.</p>
<p>(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).</p>
<p>( ) TIN: --------------------.</p>
<p>( ) TIN has been applied for.</p>
<p>( ) TIN is not required because:</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

Offers received after this date and time will be considered late in accordance with 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Prices quoted must be Firm-Fixed Price.</p>
<p>Addendum to 52.212-1(c), Period for Acceptance of Offers. The paragraph is tailored as follows: "The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 90 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers."</p>
<p>52.212-1 Proposal Contents/Required Information</p>
<p>a. To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the offers, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. The quotes/responses must be complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirements of this solicitation. To be eligible for award the offeror's response to the RFQ must include both PRICE and PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION as described below.</p>
<p>b. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.</p>
<p>1. PRICE INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Insert proposed UNIT and EXTENDED prices for all Contract Line Items (CLINS) listed above. The extended amount must equal the whole dollar unit price multiplied by the number of units. Include any pertinent information regarding industry standards that may be applicable. <br />b. Either complete Representations and Certifications in ORCA at https://orca.bpn.gov or the necessary fill-ins and certifications in provisions FAR 52.212-3. If FAR 52.212-3 is completed in hard copy it shall be returned along with the contractor's proposal.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION - Provide a list of no more than three (3) references of the most relevant contracts performed for commercial customers, Federal agencies, or other military organizations that have used, or are currently using the same or similar service proposed for this contract. Only references for same or similar services or contracts are desired. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. A past performance survery will be provided to the references that you provide. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Relevancy is defined as:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar requirements as defined in the specifications to include other type of bags with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar requirements as defined in the specifications to include other type of bags with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved either very limited or no services similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p><br />The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Contracts older than three years will not be considered. Furnish the following information for each reference:</p>
<p>(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Services provided<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified up-to-date name, address, email address, FAX and telephone number(s) for each <br />company Point of Contact. <br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in <br />accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, when determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, credentials, magnitude of work (meaning size of church, number of choirs, breadth of experience), flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs, ability of contractor to work and respond kindly to various types of people, and the ability to respond to needs that are specific to the Protestant Evangelical faith.</p>
<p>(d) Completed performance surveys are not to be reviewed by the offeror. ONCE THE SURVEY IS COMPLETED, IT IS CONSIDERED FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, and is only viewed by Government personnel directly involved in the evaluation process for this acquisition.</p>
<p>(e) Contracts provided must be recent, meaning services performed or completed in the past three years.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation<br />Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performnace information available utilizing performance information provided by the contractor, performance questionaires, PPRIRS, contracting officer's personal knowledge, or any other reasonable basis. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances contracts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>f. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>k. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest of the government.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This is a Combined Synopsis for Commercial Services prepared in accordance with subpart 13.5 under Simplified Acquisition as a supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  The announcement number for this requirement is NIHCC169926 and is being issued as a Request for Quotes.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-38 Correction.   The Department Bioethics, Clinical Center, at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland has a requirement to conduct a WEB based survey study of views and attitudes of (IRB) Institutional Review Board members regarding payment to research participants. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720. 
  
 The requirements:
 
Payment to research participants remains divisive.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that IRB members and others may limit payment because of concern about coercion or undue influence.  Little is known about the views and attitudes of IRB members regarding payment to research participants.  The NIH CC Department of Bioethics and (PRIM&R) Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research are collaborating on a survey of the PRIM&R membership regarding their attitudes towards financial payment of research subjects.  The goal of this research is to describe prevailing views and attitudes about paying research participants.  PRIM&R has endorsed the idea and will make its database of members and interested others available (email and addresses, not phone numbers).  
In consultation with the investigators, the Contractor shall

1.	Help to develop and format a WEB based survey (from a survey already developed by the investigators).  
2.	Pre-test the on-line version of the survey
3.	Prepare and distribute an initial letter of invitation that contains information about the study, the link to the WEB survey and designate monetary amount in each letter. (And a hard copy of the survey)
4.	The sample will be a defined mix of members of PRIM&R, and include all self-identified IRB members together with a random sample of members expressing an interest in research.  The total number of sampled respondents shall be 2000.  
5.	Follow up with an email reminder with web link
6.	Send an additional post-card and/or email reminder and link
7.	Monitor hits to the survey
8.	Create a data set and produce a short field report.


Program Management and Control Requirements:

The Principal Investigator will work closely with the contractor to discuss survey
Development, a time line for the project, methods for recruitment, and calculation of the
Response rate, and to monitor the progress of the study with the Department of Bioethics  
at the National Institutes of Health.     

. In order to fulfill the Governments requirements the contractor should demonstrate vendor experience, and ability to fulfill the Governments requirements for the WEB based survey.

 The Evaluation Criteria:
 Is as follows Experience with WEB based Surveys -20 Points, Responsiveness- 20 Points, TimeLine- 10 Points, Cost- 20 Points, Familiarity with Ethics and Ethics surveys- 30 Points.  
   
Security

The Contractor will use any Privacy Act information provided by the Government or other Government contractors for the purposes authorized by this Contract only and for no other.  The Contractor will not provide the information to any other person or entity, unless explicitly directed.  Each person providing service under this proposal will be required to sign a document of understanding stating that he/she understands and will comply with Privacy Act requirements.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI10060, a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-38 dated December 10, 2009. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business concern. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414, which has a size standard of 500. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure seventy-five (75) apheresis samples from Maple Leaf Medical HIV Research Collaborative Inc. The purpose of this requirement of samples is to continue investigation from rare HIV patients as we are actively studying whether HIV can be eradicated in patients. Our plan is to study cells from such individuals in order to understand the factors involved in accelerated decay of HIV in vivo. These specimens can only be obtained from 0.1-0.2% of the HIV patient population and the only known source at this time is Maple Leaf Medical HIV Research Collaborative, which has a large cohort of these patients. This requires screening of a large number of patients that will be subjected to determination of his or her CD4+ T cell count, plasma viral load, and disease status. Upon the screening procedures, a selected number of patients will be subjected to leukapheresis followed by cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It is vital to the lab's ongoing research to continue using Maple Leaf Medical HIV Research Collaborative because the data being used must be consistent with previous results under Protocol #Z01A1000851-05 Role of Viral Reservoirs in the Pathogenesis of HIV Disease. It would be detrimental to the research of the Government to change vendors at this time. Award will be based on 1) price and 2) capability to meet required specifications. Delivery shall be one year from date of award to Bethesda, Maryland, 20892. The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30. The following Federal Acquisition Regulations provisions and clauses apply to the acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; Far 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certifications Commercial Items; Far 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; Far 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; and FAR 52.406-7 Central Contractor Registration (2003). A completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representation and Certifications Commercial Items must be included with submission and can be found at Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) https://orca.bpn.gov. By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. The CCR website is http://www/ccr.gov. [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an offeror ineligible for award.] All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the Agency. Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on February 26, 2010. For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, Room 2NE52D, MSC 4811, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4811. E-mail and Fax submissions are not authorized. Request for information concerning this requirement are to be submitted in writing, and can be faxed to 301-480-8720, or e-mailed to whiterobin@niaid.nih.gov.

Does the inlay exist or will we need to produce the inlay?  Do visuals and dimensions exist for the inlay; and if so, can they be provided? ANSWER 7: Carpet Inlay: The Government has specified 32 oz plush carpet and 8# underlayment to be laid as follows: 50'x 50' Silver Mist with a 30' diameter ROUND inlay Gunmetal Gray cut nearly in the center. We will either have representatives in place to layout at time of carpet install or provide exact drawings.<BR><BR>QUESTION 8: Is the Army planning to have a representative familiar with this exhibit onsite for the duration installation? ANSWER 8: Army Representative: We will have our setup team of six people on site.

Custom carpet can be ordered but we need to know colors- etc.  We need to know if we are just laying your carpet or actually supplying it. ANSWER 13: Supply of carpet was included in the Performance Work Statement, Attachment 1 Specifications, please refer to Answer 7.<BR><BR>QUESTION 14:  Will we be provided with the electric/data line specs? ANSWER 14:  Yes. <BR><BR>QUESTION 15: Normally the general contractor requires outside contractors (like us) to submit paperwork and insurance certificates 30 days in advance.  But I saw that they forgot to put a deadline date on their form.  Do you think this will be a problem?  Seeing as we are only one week away? ANSWER 15: If you have worked with GES prior it should not present a problem. <BR><BR>QUESTION 16:  What is the display designer/builder's suggested installation time (man-hours)?  ANSWER 16: We do not have an estimate. Please consider our layout as supplies and the timeline described and as with all exhibit work.<BR><BR>QUESTION 17:  What is the total weight of the shipment?

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The purpose of this synopsis/solicitation is to inform the vendor community of DISA's proposed contract action. DISA intends to procure Trusted Network Environment (TNE) hardware and software pursuant to the authority 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) FAR 6.302-1. The solicitation/reference number is HC1047-10-T-4003 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The associated North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519. The small business size standard is $25M. New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products, and no "grey market".<br />Offeror must be registered in the Contractor Central Registration (CCR) and an authorized reseller of the items. This acquisition is a firm fixed price for network equipment in support of Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) Cross Enclave Requirement (CCER). This action is limited to specific make and model where the components have been integrated and tested to be compatible. Quotes must address whether each contract line item number (CLIN) price proposed by the offeror is based upon open market pricing, or use of an existing vehicle such as GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing, NASA SEWP pricing, etc. If individual CLIN pricing is not on an open market basis, offerors should also include the contract number on which pricing is based as part of their quote for each CLIN. This is an all-or-none requirement. Partial quotations will be deemed unresponsive and will not be evaluated. The Government will award a purchase order to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the requirements as stated in this synopsis and is most advantageous to the Government based on the lowest price.

<DESC><p>Capable sources are sought for collection and disposal of solid waste. The contractor will be responsible for providing all labor, material (including all containers), and equipment necessary to collect and dispose of solid waste, including refuse and garbage, recyclable materials, and construction debris.<br /><br />This requirement will support the Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate (AFRL/RRS) and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). The majority of service is required at Griffiss Business and Technology Park in Rome NY, however service also is required at the Newport Research Facility in Newport NY. The attached Statement of Objectives (SOO) provides additional information.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is 01 Oct 2010 through 30 Sep 2011 plus 4 option years. If all options are exercised, performance would conclude 30 Sep 2015.</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 562111. The associated small business size standard is $12,500,000 average annual revenue over the last 3 years.</p>
<p>Note that this Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used to develop an acquisition strategy and future solicitation. The Air Force is considering whether to set aside this Firm Fixed Price (FFP) acquisition for competitive 8(a), HUBZone Small Business (SB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB, or SB concerns. If adequate responses are not received, the acquisition may be solicited on a "full and open" basis.</p>
<p>If this effort is to be set aside, then a clause such as FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply and at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel will have to be expended for employees of the prime contractor.</p>
<p>All interested 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, and SB concerns are invited to respond. In order to be considered, responses must be organized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Positive statement of intent to submit a proposal for this solicitation as a prime contractor. Include a description of how the 50% requirement would be met. Describe how anticipated subcontractors, if any, would be selected and which functions they would be responsible for.</p>
<p>2. Evidence of successful performance within the past three (3) years of no more than five (5) contract efforts similar in magnitude and scope to the work described in this notice. Include information such as contract requirements, contract amounts, performance periods, and points of contact.</p>
<p>3. Description of prime contractor's Safety and Quality Control methodologies. These descriptions should be general and not exceed two (2) pages in length each. Ensure the descriptions address the performance requirements and objectives in the SOO.&nbsp; <br /><br />4. Description of how the prime contractor will fulfill the requirement to provide all containers. If sufficient containers are not owned, indicate how the containers will be acquired.</p>
<p>5. Documentation of current 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, or SB status such as SBA certification letter or other evidence. If the prime contractor's certification will expire before the anticipated performance period, include a statement acknowledging that fact. (For more information on the definition or requirements, refer to http://www.sba.gov)</p>
<p>All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, and SB concerns. Failure to submit all information requested will result in a contractor being considered &lsquo;NOT INTERESTED' in this requirement.</p>
<p>Firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit their responses to the attention of Chris Scialdone, Contract Specialist (Christopher.Scialdone@rl.af.mil) with an email copy to Janis Norelli, Small Business Specialist (janis.norelli@rl.af.mil). Responses must be sent by email.</p>
<p>All information must be received by 3:00 PM (ET) TUE 23 FEB 2010 to be considered.</p>
<p>If a solicitation for this requirement is issued, in order to receive a contract award, the successful offeror must be actively registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR - http://www.ccr.gov), Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA - http://orca.bpn.gov), and Wide Area Workflow (WAWF - https://wawf.eb.mil).</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is being issued at this time. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Any information provided to the Government as a result of this Sources Sought Notice is voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information.</p>

<p>Description: The purpose of this survey is to gather industry information prior to solicitation of the FY10 Roofing Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Unit Price contract supporting facility construction needs at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. The Roofing IDIQ program consists of soliciting and awarding task orders to a firm to furnish all plant, labor, materials, tools, supervision, equipment and transportation to manage, install, repair, and troubleshoot multiple slate, asphalt shingle, standing seam metal, built-up roofing, modified bitumen, Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) and Thermoplastic Olefin (TPO) roofing projects at Scott AFB, IL. Work to be performed under the Roofing IDIQ will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 238160 - Roofing Contractors - size standard $14 Million. Project task orders may range between estimated $3,000 - $500,000. Individual task orders will be awarded for each project. Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.

The awarded firm shall have a designated representative that will respond by telephone within one hour of contact. Once telephone contact is made, the contractor shall provide qualified service technicians and equipment on-site within 4 hours. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders awarded) is not to exceed $4M over a five-year period. The government anticipates awarding a contract with a (1)-year base period and four (1)-year option periods. The anticipated performance period will run from 1 Jun 2010 through 31 May 2011 plus four one (1)-year option periods.

All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.

The subject requirement is for acquisition of 1 NSN used on the HMMWV RADIATOR..  The material is specified as seamless stainless steel.  Welding Certificates and material certification may be requested prior to award. The intent is that the solicitation will result in an award of a contract for 10881 each with 2400 (1200 of each clin) to be delivered within 150 days of contract award and the balance delivered at 2000 per month thereafter.  The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on  17 February 2010 .  The scope of this contract includes the acquisition of a 1G item; This AMSC code implies that the Government  has screened the item and found it to be already competitive and that the data is technically suitable and legally clear.   The delivery for this acquisition will be on an FOB Destination basis.   While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based on a combination of price, delivery, past performance, and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.  This solicitation will be issued as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set Aside which requires domestic products. 

Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and Federal Specifications and Standards, Qualified Product Lists, Military Handbooks, and other standardization documents from the DoD Single Stock Point (DODSSP), in Philadelphia, PA. Most documents are available in Adobe PDF format from the ASSIST database via the Internet at http://assist.daps.mil. 

Users may search for documents using the ASSIST-Quick Search and, in most cases, download the documents directly via the Internet using standard browser software. 

Documents not available for downloading from ASSIST can be ordered from the DODSSP using the ASSIST Shopping Wizard, after establishing a DODSSP Customer Account by following the registration procedures or by phoning the DoDSSP Special Assistance Desk at (215) 697-2179 (DSN: 442-2179). 

Users not having access to the Internet may contact the DODSSP Special Assistance Desk at (215) 697-2179 (DSN: 442-2179) or mail requests to the DODSSP, Bldg. 4/D, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5094. Patterns, Drawings, Deviations Lists, Purchase Descriptions, etc., are not stocked at the DODSSP. 

The proposed contract is restricted to domestic sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-3. Accordingly, foreign sources, except Canadian sources, are not eligible for award.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>***THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO EXTEND THE RESPONSE DATE OF THIS ANNOUCEMENT TO FEBRUARY 18, 2010 AT 11:59 PM, EASTERN STANDARD TIME. ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED.

Request for Information
                  
A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Request for Information (RFI) regarding potential sources. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires. The NAICS Code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This announcement is a RFI for planning purposes only.

The intent of this RFI is to conduct market research to identify sources to support informed decisions to procure for the required services, i.e., a  large business, total small business set-aside action  (e.g., SBA Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned,), GSA task order, etc.  This notice is a RFI for all interested qualified businesses that meet the requirements for this effort. Small businesses are highly encouraged to respond.

This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  


B.  Project Background:

Initiatives to compare the effectiveness of different medical interventions and approaches to their delivery have attracted tremendous interest.  While comparative effectiveness research (CER) has typically been associated with enhancing the efficiency in the use of health care resources are used, there is a broader vision of the potential goals and benefits of such research.  CER could extend beyond the application of specific intervention methods to controlled clinical trials or within specific health care settings.  For example CER could be used to better understand what interventions work best for individuals and subgroups within populations. 
As such, CER can be instrumental in supporting and driving the development of personalized medicine, and improving not only the efficiency of care, but also outcomes for all individuals.  The science can be used to increase patient benefit, by identifying individuals who are most likely to benefit from an intervention, and to reduce risks, by identifying and protecting individuals who may be harmed.  The hope of personalized medicine is that new and existing therapies and devices will be used in combination with improved diagnostic assessments to develop a tailored strategy for treating each patient.  
A significant step in achieving this goal is to define subtypes or subpopulations of patients with disease, such that different therapies, often with different targets and mechanisms of action, can be compared with respect to how they perform in each of these subtypes.  Within the FDA, the intent is to help provide a scientific framework that can capitalize on increased CER efforts to better realize these goals of personalized medicine.  
The FDA houses the largest known repository of clinical study data--including data on drug biologics and devices safety, effectiveness and performance.  These data are an invaluable resource for CER.  Both pre- and post-approval data collected and housed at the FDA can be combined with other datasets on long term health outcomes that reside in other agencies or the private sector.  As personalized medicine develops, FDA expects an increase in the need for comparisons across products (and associated delivery mechanisms) to define how these products should be used in combination for individualized health care before and after FDA approval. Development and use of sound, consistent science-based approaches to the design, conduct and analysis of such data; and the assessment for labeling and regulatory purposes, will be critical. 

C. Objective:
The Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science (PACES) is an initiative that seeks to advance the science for such CER studies through leveraging available data, in particular the joint ARRA FDA-CER efforts, to form an enhanced standardized database, Janus. The PACES initiative will be conducted with centers residing outside of the FDA who have medical, biological, and clinically relevant computational expertise. These centers will work with FDA Center scientific and statistical experts to define questions, datasets and approaches for performing complex analyses for comparative and multi-study analyses on FDA and other large clinical datasets.  As part of this effort these Centers will conduct analyses on defined datasets including datasets previously developed as part the joint Janus initiative, where Center specific questions will drive the data transformed, standardized and loaded into the Janus data warehouse.   Additionally, PACES Centers will be expected to participate in FDA-hosted scientific workshops that address issues such as methods for cross-study and other comparative analyses, best practices in CER, and candidate studies and their design and analysis methods. These strategies will also encompass clinical trial designs that can help advance personalized medicine and health outcomes both within and outside of the FDA.
The Government intends on using a contract or contract(s) to establish two PACES Centers, each through a separate contract (or set of task orders) awarded to potentially two different Contractors. Each Contractor will establish a PACES Center to develop and use advanced computational strategies and tools to conduct CER.  Using CER methodologies, these Centers will address potential uses of large FDA datasets as well as or in conjunction with health outcomes data from other sources.  In addition, the Centers will help to develop innovative clinical trial design and data analysis strategies that can be used by the Government to facilitate prospective studies that incorporate CER and personalized medicine approaches.  
The PACES Centers will provide scientific training and collaboration to benefit future FDA-CER efforts and enhance academic capacity and expertise in product related data.  These training efforts will promote collaborative interactions with FDA scientific staff including support of Postdoctoral Fellows both within the FDA and the PACES Centers; exchanges of scientific personnel between the FDA and the PACES Centers; and the sharing of collaborative studies, including potential joint manuscripts for publication of findings to benefit the medical and scientific community.  Furthermore, the PACES Centers will be expected to participate in FDA-hosted scientific workshops to develop their plans for CER, and to discuss computational strategies developed and the findings from their analyses. This is a new requirement. 

D. Statement of Work:
D. 1. Scope 
The Contractor shall establish and operate a PACES Center to conduct CER. This work effort shall include five principle components as follows: 
	Component 1- The Contractor shall plan and organize the CER project with FDA stakeholders, including a planning workshop to define candidate CER questions and issues, analyses strategies and datasets to be utilized.
	Component 2  The Contractor shall establish a PACES Center capable of supporting the Contractors staff and providing FDA-designated researchers access to CER analysis tools and datasets.
	Component 3- The Contractor shall develop and establish a training program for scientific exchange.

<DESC>The Spring Mountains Recreation Area in Southern Nevada is soliciting companies to perform fuels treatment work as described.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be available on or around February 18, 2010.  Persons interested should place themselves on the interested vendors list so they will receive updates from FBO.  The solicitation will contain all necessary information, and will be posted at this site for download by interested vendors.
Description
The project area is located on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest; Clark County, Nevada.  The Project is approximately 21 Air Miles Northeast from Las Vegas on Highway 157. The Project starts at approximately the intersection of Highways 157 and 158 then East for approximately 2 miles on Highway 157. The project can be reached by motor vehicle by leaving Las Vegas on Highway 95 North to the intersection with Highway 157 East. Highway 157 leads to Highway 158. The project area is 69.9 acres. The work requires the pruning to specification of trees, the cutting of trees to specification, and the cutting to specification of shrubs. All cut materials meeting specification are scheduled for removal to a Processing and Storage Area. 
Trees, limbs and shrubs scheduled for removal, will be removed by a Removal Method determined by the successful contract bidder. Materials scheduled for removal can be removed by Helicopter, Yarding Equipment, or by Hand Methods. Other removal methodologies will be considered such as Chipped in Place, or a combination of more than one methodology. All cut materials scheduled for removal that are larger than 3-inches in diameter and 3 foot in length will be transported to a staging area, chipped or otherwise processed into logs and cut logs and then transported to a Designated Processing and Storage Area. Until final acceptance of acreage, units, or the project, the processed cut and chipped materials are the property of the contractor. Upon Final Acceptance of Project, the cut material becomes the property of the US Forest Service. 
Cut materials not scheduled for removal by proposed method of removal are to be piled in preparation for burning by a US Forest Service Fire Crew at a later date.
Depending upon the removal methodology, the Forest Service recognizes that up to 25% of the acreage may not be suitable for removal of all cut materials and transportation to a processing and storage area. Contractor has the opportunity to submit a bid for acres solely cut to specification and piled to specification. 
 The material to be pruned, cut, piled, chipped-in-place, or removed from the unit and transported to a process and storage area are shrubs and small trees. Trees to be pruned are of all diameter classes. Only trees 14-inches or less at 4.5 feet above the ground (DBH) will be cut and are scheduled for removal. Hazard trees above 14-inches DBH will be removed also. The 120 day contract period will be contiguous, and will begin between April 15th (or when the snow has melted sufficiently to allow work) and May 1st.
 This pre-solicitation notice is for a unit-based performance service contract on approximately 69.9 acres, plus mobilization. In Units designated as: Acre Cut to Specification for Fuels Removal, Cut Materials Removed by Accepted Proposal Method, Cut Materials Processed by Chipping on Site or Removed, The Forest Service will accept and evaluate Proposed Methodology and award the contract to the successful bidder. Prior to submitting a response to the Request for Proposal, contractor will be required to do a Walk Through with the Contract Administrator. The Forest Service may require that a potential successful bidder meet with the Contracting Officer and discuss the contractors proposal. This will be a 120 day contract and no extensions will be granted. Contractor will be expected to begin contract compliance with a work crew sufficient to complete the project in the designated timeframe.
Contractor may allow the Public to remove handcut trees and chips or choose to remove handcut trees from Government lands. At final acceptance of unit or project all handcut material becomes the property of the Forest Service. The contract requires the Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment, transportation, supplies, supervision, and incidentals necessary to achieve the objectives.  All work shall be performed during daylight hours, and shall not exceed 10 hours in one day.  A Traffic Control Plan and a weekly updated work schedule will be required prior to beginning the project.

<DESC>Description:

The U.S. Department of State (DoS) intends to conduct a competitive procurement for a contractor(s) to provide construction security monitoring services at overseas and domestic Department of State (DoS) construction sites and storage areas.  DoS requires Site Security Personnel (SSP) support services at various domestic and overseas facilities to detect unauthorized access to internal controlled areas, to deter the introduction of unauthorized materials to the site, and to surveil the activities of un-cleared construction workers to prevent the implantation of clandestine surveillance devices or systems into the structure being constructed or its surroundings.  Four types of SSP may be required: 1) Cleared American Guards (CAG), 2) Construction Surveillance Technicians (CST), 3) Team Leaders, and 4) Site Security Coordinators (SSC).  There is currently no known requirement for construction security monitoring services at any domestic locations.  However, if a domestic need for these services should arise, DoS may also acquire the necessary services under this contract through issuance of delivery/task orders, which will specify locations and will include any provision and/or instructions applicable to work within the United States.

DoS plans to award multiple Labor-Hour, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for base and (4) four one-year option years. The IDIQ awards will be made to the responsive offerors, whose proposals conform to the solicitation, and will offer the Best Value to the government, whereas technical factors are more important than cost.  One award will be set aside for small business should a small business be found capable.  To qualify as a small business under the NAICS code, 561612, the small business size is the average annual receipts of no more than $18.5M.

Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) database prior to proposal submissions.  Offerors may obtain information on registration requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.  The Offeror is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.


Proposal Submissions:

The Request for Solicitation and its attached documents will be posted under Solicitation Number, SAQMMA10R0022, on or around January 21, 2010.  No paper copies will be mailed. Proposal submissions will be due no later than 3:00 PM, EST on March 3, 2010.

Questions (Q&A) period opens with the posting of the synopsis. Questions should be e-mailed to:  jonesta3@state.gov.  Questions should be received no later than COB (5:00 PM, EST) on February 3, 2010.  Responses to all submitted questions will posted as an Amendment in FedBizOPPS.com. DoS does not plan to hold a site visit/pre-proposal conference for prospective offerors.

Security Clearance Requirements:

Offerors must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Top Secret facility clearance (FCL), issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M.  All entities comprising a joint venture for this effort must already possess a TS FCL, as well as the joint venture.  Successful offerors shall assign only U.S. citizens who possess current final Top Secret personnel security clearances for performance as Site Security Personnel on this contract.  Certain domestic management personnel must possess DSS Secret personnel security clearances.

DOS will not sponsor any firm for a facility clearance or facility clearance upgrade from Secret to Top Secret for this solicitation due to time constraints.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.  A bidders DD Form 254 has been issued with this solicitation.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MEDICAL/SURGICAL FLEET PRIME VENDOR<br /><br />1.&nbsp; The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Medical Supplier Operations Directorate is the contracting activity.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; The action submitted for approval is for the acquisition of supplies on Other Than Full and Open Competition basis.&nbsp; This justification is for a second bridge contract for a period of 180 days to ensure continuation of the Medical/Surgical Fleet Prime Vendor contract currently held by American Medical Depot (AMD) under contract number SPM200-09D7150.&nbsp; The first bridge contract expires on January 30, 2010.&nbsp; The proposed 180-day bridge contract will provide accessibility to all items currently on Medical/Surgical Distribution and Pricing Agreements (DAPAs) through July 29, 2010.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; The supplies required to meet the Navy Fleet's needs are a wide array of medical/surgical items, including surgical dressing materials, medical and surgical instruments, utensils, and supplies.&nbsp; The estimated dollar value of the 180-day bridge is $1,604,642.40 based upon our current annual sales of approximately $3,253,860.00.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; The applicable statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; The use of this authority is necessary because the second-generation contract for various medical and surgical items in support of Naval Fleet operations has been delayed in paret due (reducated)<br />(redacted)<br /><br /><br /><br />(redacted)<br /><br /><br />At the time of the first generation Medical/Surgical Fleet Prime Vendor contract<br />ten years ago the 3030 version of American National Standards (ANSI) X12 transaction sets was modified to be capable of providing this military-unique data.&nbsp; In recent years, however, a newer 4010 version was adopted by the commercial industry which does not have this capability.&nbsp; Furthermore, the practice of accepting and processing these military-unique identifiers is not performed by the medical/surgical vendor base, as both military and commercial customers comply with and operate using the current commercial standards.&nbsp; Changing the transmission and processing capability is unlikely since the Navy represents a small protion of the overall business for suppliers of medical and surgical materials.&nbsp; Thus, the medical/surgical prime vendor industry lacks sufficient financial incentive to even contemplate reverting back to this older technology.&nbsp; Since AMD is already using the 3030 version of Electronic Data Intrchange (EDI), it is the only medical/surgical Prime Vendor that is currently geared to meet the needs of the Navy.<br /><br />The first generation Med/Surg Fleet Prime Vendor contract was awarded to AMD as a sole-source 8(a) set-aside.&nbsp; AMD graduated from the 8(a) program while the first generation contract was still in effect, and so the bridge contracs were not 8(a) set-asides.&nbsp; (redacted)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For continuity pruposes, AMD would be the recipient of this proposed second bridge contract.<br /><br />The first bridge contract, issued in March 2009 for 306 days, was thought to be of sufficient duration to provide enough time to award the second generation contract.&nbsp; The second generation solicitation was issued in August 2009, and closed in September 2009; (redacted)<br /><br />(redacted)<br /><br />(redacted)<br /><br />(redacted)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AMD's and DSCP's considerable involvement in processing a large volume of emergency requisitions in response to the recent Haiti earthquake on January 12, 2010 (redacted)<br /><br />(redacted)<br /><br /><br />(redacted)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In order to assure uninterrupted medical/surgical Fleet Prime Vendor support after the January 30, 2010 expiration date of the current bridge contract, the effective dates of the new bridge contract will be&nbsp;from January 31, 2010 through July 29, 2010, a period of 180 days. (redacted)<br />(redacted)<br />(redacted)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; however, the second bridge contract will cease upon actual implementation of the second generation&nbsp;award.<br /><br />The amount of time required to process the various phases of the second generation contract and the multiple levels of approval required for a contract of this size and complexity preclude any possibility of a timely award and the necessary smooth transition period from the current bridge contract to the next generation contract.&nbsp; There are approximately (redacted) current active items&nbsp;contained on the Fleet's (redacted)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for which it relies (redacted) on the DLA Prime Vendor contract.&nbsp; As (redacted) are currentlydepot-stocked, failure to keep the current Prime Vendor contract in place would result in massive delivery delays for (redacted)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; currently being supplied by AMD on a routine basis.&nbsp; Additionally, a lapse in coverage would result in having to dedicate more (redacted)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to handle a significant increase in (redacted)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requisitions to keep the Fleet supplied.&nbsp; Without a second bridge contract, a severe gap in coverage would result.<br /><br />AMD is the only medical/surgical Prime Vendor that can perform the bridge contract.&nbsp; The current Medical/Surgical Fleet Prime Vendor contract SOW reflects several military-unique aspects of processing&nbsp;transactions that are not found among standard industry practices of large suppliers.&nbsp; AMD is the only known Prime Vendor with business practices which accepts the previous generation EDI-3030 version of 850s (purchase orders) which allows for receipt and processing of extra key data elements (redated)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp; In concert with these requirements, AMD prints NSNs and part numbers, along with (redacted)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on each packing slip, and provides important manual backorder status for accurate fill rate calculations.<br /><br />Standard business operating procedures among&nbsp;Prime Vendor suppiers do not lend themselves to accommodating&nbsp;these types of military-unique requirements, particularly for the relatively short period&nbsp;of time and limited financial return that would result from (redacted)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in monthly sales for the proposed second bridge contract.&nbsp; Extensive programming changes in their EDI structure and associated internal hardware (redacted)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would not be economically feasible.&nbsp; Accordingly, AMD is the only known sources to fulfill these requirements.<br /><br />6.&nbsp; The propsed bridge contract will be synopsized in FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.2.&nbsp; In addition, this justification will be made available for public inspection, after award, in accordance with FAR 6.305.<br /><br />7.&nbsp; As the Contracting Officer, I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable because the items that comprise the current contract have already been determined to&nbsp;be fair and reasonable based upon a pre-priced Distribution and Pricing Agreements (DAPA) catalog.&nbsp; Prices for items within the DAPA catalog are individually determined to be fair and raasonable before time of award based upon comparison with Federal Supply Schedule prices, discounts from commercial catalog prices, and comparison with historical pricing to other customers under an uncommitted volume basis.&nbsp; Additions to the DAPA catalog and price changes made after award are also determined to be fair and reasonable in advance using the same methodologies.&nbsp; AMD has agreed to a distribution fee of 9.9%, which is .6%&nbsp;less than the current 10.5% fee.<br /><br />The current distribution fee, which remained constant throughout the first generation ten-year contract and during the first bridge contract, was determined to be fair an dreasonable at the time of award, based upon a comparison of historical Prime Vendor distribution fees to the unique aspects of the Statement of Work and associated risks that an 8(a) firm assumed on the first-generation Government Prime Vendor contract.<br /><br />8.&nbsp; Market research was not performed because, as described in more detail in paragraph 5 above, AMD is the only medical/surgical Prime Vendor that can perform the bridge contract.&nbsp; AMD is the only known vendor which accepts the previous generation EDI 3030 version of 850 (purchase orders) allowing for receipt and processing of extra key, Government-unique, data elements.<br /><br />9.&nbsp; There are no additiional facts supporting Other Than Full and Open Competition.<br /><br />10.&nbsp; AMD is the only source expected to express an interest in the proposed bridge contract.<br /><br />11.&nbsp; The second generation acquisition, which incorporates up-to-date EDI technology and does away with the above-described military-unique aspects, has been solicited as a sole-source 8(a) set-aside (redacted)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the decision be made to request that the Small Business Administration (SBA) grant a release from the 8(a) program, all future acquisitions for these requirements will be competed on a full and open competition basis.&nbsp; (redacted)<br /><br />12.&nbsp; As the Contracting Officer, I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), specifically the Office of Water, Office of Groundwater Drinking Water, Water Security Division (OG/OGWDW/WSD) requires an increase in the ceiling capacity of Contract EP-C-05-045 during Option Period IV in an amount of 20,000 hours level of effort. Increasing the capacity of the contract by this amount will put the ceiling of the contract for Option Period IV in line with the actual utilized contract levels in the previous four contract periods. The contract had originally been solicited and awarded with a bell-curve expectation (ramping up in the Base Period, straight-line for the next three periods, and ramping down in the final period), but subsequent events following that award have demonstrated that the contract should have been structured with consistent contract capacity in each of the option periods. Option Period IV is the final period on the contract. In order to issue all anticipated work assignments for Option Period IV, all available quantity option amounts have already been exercised.
<p>The contract provides technical support services of a unique nature for the WSD mission needs, and also provides critical support services to other Offices of the EPA [Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) Office of Emergency Management (OEM) effort; National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) efforts, including Methods Development and Security Products Assessment and Review efforts]. Without having sufficient capacity available for OEM on this contract, its very high priority, high visibility requirements would be severely impacted, jeopardizing the progress toward carrying out homeland security directives.</p>
<p>The US EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, an increase to the level of effort for this contract. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) and FAR 6.302.1 which allows for negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source. The basis for this determination is that only Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), the incumbent, can provide the continuity to complete the remaining complex technical work. The requirements are in sensitive stages of development, and abandoning the efforts at this point for lack of capacity would not be a reasonable option. Likewise, the time required to solicit a new contractor and allow that contractor to get up to speed on the requirements in the middle of a project would not be cost effective or efficient. In addition, the contract includes specific capabilities for secret and/or sensitive work, which is not common on other Agency contracts already in place. Furthermore, the analysis type effort for various highly sensitive contaminants is also unique on this contract, and is able to support the type of method development that NHSRC is working toward.</p>
