DESCRIPTION: The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS for the study entitled "EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM SUBSEA PROCESSING."  The MMS is a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, which has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf, Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994.   INTRODUCTION:  Production of oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) faces new challenges as the industry moves into deeper water.  The cost of exploration and operation in deep water (over 1000 ft.) is much higher than on shallower portions of the continental shelf.  New technologies are required to meet the demands of greater depths.  The equipment and structures used are far above the seafloor.  Besides the requirement for stronger structural integrity for equipment reaching the seafloor, the forces required to lift the product to the surface are greater.  Installing and maintaining a platform in deep water is a costly proposition and can suffer from catastrophic events such as hurricanes.  Processing oil and gas at the seafloor can eliminate some of the risks and expenses of operating in deep water.  Subsea processing involves a large template and a variety of equipment placed on the seafloor.  The technology of subsea processing can remove the need for a seasurface structure or can allow extraction from numerous wells to be combined to one platform with unlimited tie-back distance.  It reduces the problems of hydrate formation by removing water before transporting through lines at near freezing temperatures on the deep seafloor.  This can also eliminate the necessity for hydrate inhibitors.  Water is then re-injected to a well.  Removal of water before transport also increases efficiency by reducing the weight and maximizing the capacity of pipelines.  Gas can also be re-injected instead of flaring.  Subsea processing would be a new technology in the Gulf of Mexico and the potential environmental impacts from this type of process need to be evaluated.  The Technical Assessment and Research group of the Minerals Management Service has recently assessed the risks of subsea processing as compared to surface processing.  The study included the possibility of component failures, which could lead to a potential spill.  The technical report is available at http://www.mms.gov/tarprojects/500/Report%2070003245%20Rev%202.pdf.   SCOPE OF WORK:  This currently proposed study will look further to the potential environmental impacts from such a failure.  This project is designed to gather all relevant information for evaluating the possible environmental effects related to subsea processing.  The intent is to gather all the information available, make logical deductions from that information, and determine information needs concerning possible impacts that we cannot clearly predict.   OBJECTIVES:  The objectives of this project are: (1) review and synthesize information about the technology of subsea processing, including future trends; (2) review and synthesize all studies conducted on the potential environmental impacts of subsea processing; (3) review and synthesize information on platform processes that could possibly be moved to the seafloor in the future and the environmental issues and potential environmental impacts; (4) evaluate potential environmental impacts of all aspects of subsea processing and potential accidents associated with subsea processing in the Gulf of Mexico.  (Extrapolate from known processing effects as necessary); and (5) identify data gaps, information needs, and questions that should be answered.  The period of performance of this study shall be twelve (12) months, including the completion of all deliverables, with an estimated cost between $75,000 and $99,999.  The study area is the entire Gulf of Mexico out to the extent of the U.S. exclusive economic zone.   HOW TO RESPOND:   A copy of the RFP package will be provided to those who contact the contracting officer as stated above.  The additional  instructions on criteria and evaluation of your proposal will be provided in the RFP package.  Please contact Olivia Adrian at olivia.adrian@mms.gov, phone 703-787-1151 if you have additional questions.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a sole-source follow-on contract to FiberGate, Inc. for the continued lease/maintenance of sixty-three (63) FiberGate owned fiber optic cable segments currently linking various Centers and Offices of the FDA.  The cable segments are primarily in the Rockville, Maryland, area, but three (3) of those cables are to locations outside of Rockville:  to FDA’s White Oak campus, to the FDA building in College Park, Maryland, and to the Hubert Humphrey Building in the District of Columbia.   FDA paid Fibergate a substantial sum for the installation of (these) cables under the previous contract.   Replacing Fibergate with another contractor who would install its own cables would create a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered by competition, and would also create an unacceptable delay in contract performance.  The anticipated period of performance will be 60 months (5 years) with a 12 month base year, and 4 option years.

<DESC>The US Army proposes to acquire, on an other than full and open competitive basis, MFD units to support the effort for engineering support of a Brown-out capability to qualify, in the conduct and documentation of software testing, hardware environmen tal testing, and Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (EEE) testing, for line replaceable units (LRUs) to ensure they meet survivability requirements as defined by MIL-STD-461E and MIL STD 810F.  Rockwell Collins is the original and sole designer and deve loper of the Multi function display, as well as the applicable platform interface and application software for the platforms cited. The brown out capability being developed and tested must be capable of integration within the CH-47F avionics suite which is  being developed by Rockwell Collins under an existing contractual effort which expires in 2010. This suite uses the same multi function display as is going to be procured under this purchase thus ensuring seamless integration and maintenance.  All hardwar e development rights are proprietary since the MFD is used on a multitude of government and civil platforms. To purchase the rights and qualify another vendor would cause an unacceptable slip in schedule and significant duplication of cost, neither of whic h is prudent with the introduction of the Common Aviation Architecture System (CAAS) into the CH-47F platform which utilizes the MFD to be procured under this action.  Rockwell Collins, Inc., 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52498.   See Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to solicit on a non-competitive basis with Occupational and Environmental Life Science (OELS)  Inc., to provide simultaneous measurements of whole-body vibration and postural stress with a newly developed, computer assisted recording and long-term analysis of musculoskeletal loading instrumentation package, known as CUELA, for working locomotive engineers, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302 under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has concern with  the incidence of back pain and disability retirements related to back pain among locomotive engineers.  As one element of the Railroad Human Factors Project, the Volpe Center has been tasked to explore this issue.  Locomotives have vibration characteristics unlike any other mode of transportation.

<DESC>This request is being solicited on an unrestricted base. This is an Architect-Engineer (A-E) service acquisition for a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base period of one year and two option periods of one year each. The NAICS Code is 541330. A-E services are required for the preparation of parametric estimating and programming, development of plans, specifications and cost estimates suitable for bidding and repairs, renovations, alterations, upgrades, possible replacement (new construction), and associated demolition work for various projects primarily at Seymour Johnson AFB and occasionally at Dare County Bomb Range and Fort Fisher in NC.  A-E services for these projects will be accomplished under Task Orders written against the IDIQ contract. Construction cost ranges for these projects vary; however, it is not contemplated that the cost range for any individual job will be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The selected A-E firm(s) will be required to participate in an orientation, scope of work and site visit meetings (when requested) within 7 calendar days after receiving the request for proposal for a project. The maximum monetary limit for all task orders under this contract shall not exceed $2,250,000 with the maximum task order amount of $299,000. The guaranteed minimum for the IDIQ contract is $10,000 for the life of the contract. The work involved is multi-disciplined and includes, but is not limited to architectural, structural, civil, environmental, plumbing, electrical, management information systems (MIS) technicians, fire protection, site work, and mechanical requirements. Field surveying, landscaping design, and architectural rendering capabilities may be required. Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required.  Familiarity with English and metric system of measurements is required. Disciplines and capabilities may be represented within the same firm or with consultants that regularly work with the primary firm. The firm(s) must also be able to provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering services. All drawings are to be in electronic attachment format, DFX or DGN format and shall be 100% compatible with Computer Assisted Design Drawing Software (CADD).  Documentation shall be furnished with each drawing file detailing level layer usage, and scale information for drawings.  The selected firm(s) must have the capability of providing final drawings formatted in AutoCAD 2002 or higher.  Each final drawing shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system. The firm(s) shall also be able to obtain MaxView/SourceView software and convert drawing files formatted for electronic posting over the Internet. Each converted drawing file shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system. Firms are reminded of the requirement in FAR 36.601-3(a), which states that the construction design specifications shall require the maximum practicable use of recovered materials considering the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness. The possibility of hazardous materials, i.e., asbestos, lead paint, and other materials may exist at project sites. All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A-E firm(s) or their sub-contractors. The general intention is to provide for such design and engineering services as necessary to support the procurement of construction requirements/ acquisitions. For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as technical reports, studies, site investigations, concept designs, cost estimates, surveys, shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, Title II, preparation of construction record drawings, and O&M manuals, may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work. Because the IDIQ contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns to include all elements referenced in FAR 52.219-9. All contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.  All offerors in response to this solicitation shall complete electronic annual representation and certifications at http://www.bpn.gov/orca in conjunction with required regisistration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for an Active Layer Theatre Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) Program Management Support Contract.  

The Program Management Support effort is divided into two main tasks. The first is management of the overall contractor effort to ensure its responsiveness to program requirements. The second is direct support to the program office to include assistance in maintaining a program master, plan, assistance in preparing budgetary and programmatic documentation, and assistance in supporting risk analysis and risk management.

The successful bidder for this contract will not be allowed to compete as a prime contractor or participate as a subcontractor for the Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) contract to be funded under projects 0VA03019 and 0VA03020.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NC3A intends to use the Best Value procedure in its evaluation of bids. 

The estimated value of this project will not be disclosed at this time. NC3A has determined that disclosure of the budget information to prospective bidders may be detrimental to the execution of fair competition. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-11485-ALTBMD. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The tasks for Program Management Support center around the maintenance and upkeep of program data and records and the development of drafts of programmatic documents to include the Program Master Plan, forecasts of resource requirements, documentation of program risks, and support in the development of risk mitigation strategies. These activities include, but are not limited to, the following:

Supporting the drafting of a Program Master plan and providing support to document the plan in an appropriate program management tool

Ensuring that the necessary updating of the program master plan is accomplished in an accurate and timely manner

Supporting the development and maintenance of a program work breakdown structure in both a functional and organizational configuration

Maintaining an accessible file of contractor deliverables and coordinating distribution of contractor deliverables

Maintaining a program office reference library and program office records

Providing support for program cost estimates

Supporting the development of annual program office budget estimates

Drafting program annual/recurring financial and management reports

Supporting the development of and ongoing updates to a program risk register

Supporting the drafting of contingency/risk mitigation plans

Supporting risk management reviews, both those internal to the program office and those conducted for the program steering committee
 
ELIGIBILITY

Performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at the level of NATO SECRET.

Interested firms must be nominated by their Embassies with the required Declaration of Eligibility. Requests for participation received directly from firms cannot be considered.

COMPANY CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. However, all firms whose facility is located within the United States must be declared eligible by the U.S. Department of Commerce in order to qualify to bid for this procurement. 

The Host Nation is the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A). Only firms that the U.S. Department of Commerce has declared as eligible will be allowed to bid. A Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) will be submitted on their behalf to the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, Belgium, which will in turn provide the Declaration of Eligibility to the Host Nation.

Please visit the following website for more information on applying for the required Declaration of Eligibility: http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

BIDDING PROCEDURES

Those firms that are nominated to bid by their Embassies will be added to a distribution list of firms eligible to bid on this ICB project. When the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) is issued, those firms will be contacted directly by the Host Nation.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Embassy in Brussels to submit a Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) on your behalf: 3 January 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) will be forwarded to those on the Bidder List: January 2006

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<DESC>A modification to the previous notice is made to include the project requirement for weekly interaction and close coordination with engineers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico as well as to provide additional specifications for the required tasks.  The revised notice, inclusive of this requirement, is as follows:

This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.102(d)(2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  The contract awarded as a result of proposals submitted in response to this BAA is considered to be the result of competition to the maximum extent practicable. A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.  Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC (BSA) will not issue paper copies of this announcement.  BSA reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  BSA provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of BSA to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  BSA is interested in receiving innovative proposals that offer potential for advancement and improvement in the engineering design study for the PHENIX Silicon Vertex detector (VTX).  The successful offeror will be required to perform an engineering 
design study of components of the Silicon Vertex Detector (VTX) for the PHENIX experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The VTX is a compact device, approximately cylindrical in shape with an outer radius of 20 cm and a length of 80 cm. The VTX has three main components, a central barrel containing four layers of silicon sensors (both silicon strips and pixels) with approximately 4.3 million sensor channels and associated electronics plus two end caps with four strip layers each and approximately 1.3 million sensor channels and associated electronics.   The frames supporting the VTX sensors and electronics must be low mass and low density, composed primarily of carbon composite materials to allow a maximum 100 micron deflection under gravity of any component of the VTX mechanical system. The VTX must have an associated cooling system that is capable of removing up to 2500 Watts of heat from the device. The operating temperature of the device will be 0 degrees Celsius. Together the mechanical and cooling system must add no more than 2.8%of a radiation length to the total average thickness of the detector. 

The company performing this job must have experience working with large channel count, silicon sensor detector systems for particle physics and space-based experiments. They must have a demonstrated track-record of design of mechanical support, cooling and alignment systems with micron-level precision and multi-project experience designing and prototyping carbon composite-based low mass mechanical support systems. The company must also have significant experience working on advanced technology mechanical engineering projects for the US Department of Energy and NASA. This project will require weekly interaction and close coordination with engineers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. 

Tasks to be performed:
1) Barrel Ladder Staves
•	R&D: Perform FEA modal analysis to determine the dynamic stiffness of the lay-up. Perform FEA for mass-loaded static stiffness to insure less than 100 microns of gravitational sag. Optimize for mass (low Z) and structural integrity. An analysis will be performed to determine if mounting the staves only at the end of the VTX is acceptable.
•	Design:   Design the staves to be similar in concept to those used by silicon vertex detectors of the equivalent complexity in recent particle physics or spaced-based experiments. Design the connection between the ladders and the barrel mounts.

2) Ladder Coolant Tubes plus Terminations
•	R&D: A thermal analysis will be performed to size the ladder coolant tubes and to determine suitable connectors for a system that must operate at 0 degrees Celsius.
•	Design: Design the routing of the coolant lines inside the VTX detector.

3)Barrel Mounts
•	R&D: Perform FEA modal analyses to determine dynamic stiffness. Perform FEA for mass-loaded static stiffness to insure less than100 micron of gravity sag. Optimize for mass (low Z), structural integrity and access.
•	Design: The cant angle and overlap specifications for precise positioning of the ladders will be incorporated into the design of the barrel mounts. The connection between the barrel mounts and the space frame will be designed. It will be determined how to precisely position the barrels through an adjustment feature.

4)Space Frame:
•	R&D: The VTX space frame design should use a kinematic mounting technique with analysis similar to that used on silicon vertex detectors of the equivalent complexity in recent particle physics or spaced-based experiments. Perform FEA modal analyses to determine dynamic stiffness. Perform FEA for mass-loaded static stiffness to insure less than 100 micron gravity sag. Optimize for mass (low Z), structural integrity and access. Optimize the location and shape of mass reducing cutouts in consultation with Los Alamos National Laboratory project engineers.
•	Design: Design a carbon-composite structure, octagonal in shape. Use stiffening sandwich structure end plates. Determine the best method for connecting the two space frame clamshell halves.

The applicable NAICS code is 541710—Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.  This notice constitutes an announcement for the competitive selection of research proposals. This announcement is a continuously open announcement valid through 12 January 2006.  Brookhaven Science Associates reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  The awards will take the form of a contract. Multiple awards are not anticipated. Brookhaven Science Associates encourages Educational Institutions, Small Businesses (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (SDBs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) to submit proposals under this announcement.  All prospective offerors shall submit an initial technical and cost proposal, detailing the firm’s technical capabilities, comparable engineering design study work history, assets, and availability.  Capability statements must demonstrate qualified available personnel with the pertinent experience, adequate organizational and administrative structure, and demonstration of the resources necessary to perform the work.  Capability Statements submitted that do not provide sufficient information will not be considered. The cost proposal must include cost estimates for all tasks to be performed under the resultant contract. Prospective and qualified offerors are encouraged to submit technical and cost proposals before Jan 12, 2006.   It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement contract award will be made as soon as possible after review of all technical and cost proposals. The selection of proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response this announcement. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Brookhaven National Laboratory weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds.

<DESC>This request is being solicited on an unrestricted base. This is an Architect-Engineer (A-E) service acquisition for a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base period of one year and two option periods of one year each. The NAICS Code is 541330. A-E services are required for the preparation of parametric estimating and programming, development of plans, specifications and cost estimates suitable for bidding and repairs, renovations, alterations, upgrades, possible replacement (new construction), and associated demolition work for various projects primarily at Seymour Johnson AFB and occasionally at Dare County Bomb Range and Fort Fisher in NC.  A-E services for these projects will be accomplished under Task Orders written against the IDIQ contract. Construction cost ranges for these projects vary; however, it is not contemplated that the cost range for any individual job will be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The selected A-E firm(s) will be required to participate in an orientation, scope of work and site visit meetings (when requested) within 7 calendar days after receiving the request for proposal for a project. The maximum monetary limit for all task orders under this contract shall not exceed $2,250,000 with the maximum task order amount of $299,000. The guaranteed minimum for the IDIQ contract is $10,000 for the life of the contract. The work involved is multi-disciplined and includes, but is not limited to architectural, structural, civil, environmental, plumbing, electrical, management information systems (MIS) technicians, fire protection, site work, and mechanical requirements. Field surveying, landscaping design, and architectural rendering capabilities may be required. Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required.  Familiarity with English and metric system of measurements is required. Disciplines and capabilities may be represented within the same firm or with consultants that regularly work with the primary firm. The firm(s) must also be able to provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering services. All drawings are to be in electronic attachment format, DFX or DGN format and shall be 100% compatible with Computer Assisted Design Drawing Software (CADD).  Documentation shall be furnished with each drawing file detailing level layer usage, and scale information for drawings.  The selected firm(s) must have the capability of providing final drawings formatted in AutoCAD 2002 or higher.  Each final drawing shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system. The firm(s) shall also be able to obtain MaxView/SourceView software and convert drawing files formatted for electronic posting over the Internet. Each converted drawing file shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system. Firms are reminded of the requirement in FAR 36.601-3(a), which states that the construction design specifications shall require the maximum practicable use of recovered materials considering the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness. The possibility of hazardous materials, i.e., asbestos, lead paint, and other materials may exist at project sites. All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A-E firm(s) or their sub-contractors. The general intention is to provide for such design and engineering services as necessary to support the procurement of construction requirements/ acquisitions. For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as technical reports, studies, site investigations, concept designs, cost estimates, surveys, shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, Title II, preparation of construction record drawirawings, and O&M manuals, may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work. Because the IDIQ contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns to include all elements referenced in FAR 52.219-9. All contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.  All offerors in response to this solicitation shall complete electronic annual representation and certifications at http://www.bpn.gov/orca in conjunction with required regisistration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. 
B. SELECTION CRITERIA: Selection criteria to be utilized are listed in the relative order of importance as follows: 1. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction and the use of recovered materials; 2. Professional qualifications of key personnel of the A-E firm and consultants, including sub-contractors, and the proposed project team (the team/office actually accomplishing the work) in providing complete architectural services with multi-disciplinal engineering support services for the design methods and design requirements, employs or has consultant for the following: Architects, Structural, Civil, Environmental, Mechanical, Electrical Engineers, Plumbers, Interior Designers, Landscape Designers, Registered Surveyors and Fire Protection Specialists; 3. Professional capacity to complete projects within the established time limits, meeting project dollar thresholds, and current workload; 4. Ability to provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering. Ability to provide full and/or part-time on-site designs and plans review by professional engineers and/or architects on an as-needed basis. 5.

Historical dollar value and magnitude of requirements performed; 7. Demonstrated capacity of preparing drawings on Computer Assisted Design Drawings (CADD); 8. Special emphases will be placed on firms located within 150 miles of Seymour Johnson AFB NC which is located in Goldsboro NC; 9. Volume of DoD contracts awarded in the previous 12 months. It is estimated that this contract will be awarded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS

<DESC>The purpose of this request for Information is to identify qualified suppliers for the implementation of a national roof assessment and management program.

The United States Postal Service (“USPS”) is seeking companies or firms that can furnish, implement, and assist in executing a national roof asset management program. The Postal Service has an estimated 300 million square feet of roofing.  The Postal Service has ascertained that extensive amounts of financial and human resources have been wasted on roofing due to the following reasons:
•	Roofs are consistently failing prior to their expected service lives and replaced prematurely;
•	Roofs that can be repaired or restored at a fraction of the cost are being replaced unnecessarily; and
•	Traditional roof manufacturer warranties typically have been proven reactive in nature, and limit contractor liabilities, which reduce a roofing system’s service life and does not transfer substantive risk. 

Consequently the USPS is seeking, under the scope of the national roof asset management program, companies that can help eliminate unnecessary spending due to premature and unnecessary roof replacement by purchasing the repair, restoration, regular inspections, preventive maintenance, housekeeping and leak responsibility activities, which will bring USPS roofing systems to a watertight standard at a fraction of the cost to replace. 

The USPS program will effectively transfer to the contractor 100% technical responsibility and financial risk regardless of the scope of labor and materials associated with roof upgrades such as repairs, restorations, or section replacements as well as maintenance, for the performance of the entire roofing inventory by way of a performance warranty on these preexisting assets regardless of the roofs’ material manufacturer and installer.

<CONTACT>Mack A. Blankenship Purchasing Agent 9096975362     Mack_Blankenship@ca.blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management, Needles Field Office (NFO) has a requirement  to secure the physical hazards posed by three abandoned mine features located adjacent to Bonanza Spring.  The purpose of this announcement is to obtain installation of a bat-compatible gate across the entrance of an adit, and the permanent closure of two nearby mine shafts using polyurethane foam plugs. This requirement is 100% Set-Aside for small businesses under NACIS 326150.  Contractors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered eligible for award.  Facsmile proposals will be accepted at (951) 697-5298. Point of Contact for technical questions:  Heather McKenny (760) 326-7011 or Alicia Rabas (760) 326-7060. Point of Contact for contractual questions:  Mack Blankenship (951) 697-5362 Description of Work and Services: Primary access to the project site will be on Bonanza Spring Road, 7.2 miles W of Essex, CA on U.S. Rt. 66, across from Danby Road.  Bonanza Spring is approximately 3.6 miles from Rt 66. Bonanza Spring Road is a designated route of travel that may be utilized by the general public for casual use.  However, Bonanza Spring Road is in poor condition and will require high-clearance four-wheel drive vehicles to transport materials and tools to and from the general work site.   There is no easy access to the mine features from the general work site.  Access to the mine features is across extremely rough terrain that includes very steep topography and eroded drainages.  Therefore, vehicles will not be able to access the mine features directly, and the project may require alternative modes of transportation for materials and tools (i.e. mule or hand-carry).  The lower mine shaft is approximately 1250 feet from Bonanza Spring Road where the vehicles will be parked.  The adit is approximately 1750 feet from the road, and the upper mine shaft is approximately 1900 feet from the road.  NFO staff will work with the contractor to determine the most appropriate access route and means of transporting materials and tools. Bat-compatible Gate The gate must be constructed in accordance with the guidelines contained in Bats and Mines, Bat Conservation International, Inc., Resource Publication No. 3, 12/98.  These guidelines meet our dual objects to conserve bat habitat and to protect the public from physical hazards posed by the mine adit.  Bat-compatible gates are designed to maintaining proper airflow within the mine feature and to allow continued access to the mine by bats.  Gates built and installed following the guidelines contained in Bats and Mines have also proven to be extremely successful in keeping unauthorized personnel out.    The materials used in the gate will be as follows.  The sill which the gate rests on will be 6" x 6" angle iron, 3/8" thick.  The uprights will be 4" x 4" steel tubing, 3/8" thick.  The bars will be 4" x 4" angle iron, 3/8" thick.  The bat guards will be 4" plate, ?" thick.  The pins will be #8 rebar in the entrance.  The gate will include a removable bar to allow access to sites by authorized personnel following gating.  This bar will be secured by grade 8 bolts with a machine head.  The keys for these locks will be specific to the customer.  The gate will be installed using new materials and sound industry practices.  The gate parts will be welded on site with either the "stick" or MIG process.  All materials and tools for this project will be supplied by the contractor. Polyurethane Foam Plug Polyurethane foam made by Foam Concepts will be used to permanently close the upper and lower mine shafts.  The contractor will install the foam plugs using techniques supplied by the manufacturer of the foam.  The foam plug will be approximately seven feet deep and will be covered by at least one foot of dirt/rock fill.  NFO will specify where the fill can be taken from.  The dirt/rock fill will be contoured to minimize the evidence of the existence of the shafts reducing the chance of people trying to gain access in the future. Time Frame The project must be completed within 90 days of the award of contract. Tortoise Conservation Measures  Because the project is located within designated Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) Critical Habitat the project must be completed during tortoise inactive season (Mid-November to Mid-March or mid-June to Mid-September).  Additional conservation measures will be implemented in order to avoid effects upon the federally threatened desert tortoise.  The contractor will be apprised of, and will agree to follow these measures prior to commencement of the project.  In addition, the work crew will be briefed before commencement of project activities on measures to protect the desert tortoise and its habitat.  The NFO will have a qualified biologist present the program to all personnel.  The program will include the distribution of the tortoise, general behavior and ecology of the tortoise, sensitivity to human activities, legal protection, penalties for violations of Federal or State laws, and project protective measures. Health and Safety The contractor will adopt the Needles Field Office General Field Project Health and Safety Plan.  Mitigation for hazardous conditions created by the installation project that are not covered by the NFO Health and Safety plan must be properly addressed within the contract by the contractor.  Transportation and Cleanup The contractor will be responsible for transporting all materials and tools to and from the work site.  At the end of the project the contractor will be responsible for removing all traces of the installation effort.  Nothing will be left on site that was not there on arrival.   Accommodations The work crew, and pack animals if used, may need to remain on site for the duration of the project.  NFO staff will determine the appropriate location for camping and for corrals prior to the commencement of the project and for remediation of the site following completion of the project.  The contractor will be responsible for remediation of the site following completion of the project.  Accommodations off-site will be the responsibility of the contractor. Minimum Qualifications "	At least two years of experience in the design, fabrication, and installation of bat-compatible gates "	At least two years of experience in the closure of abandoned mine openings using polyurethane foam "	Completion of 40 hours of mandatory health and safety training, including annual refresher courses, as required under Public Law 91-173 as amended by Public Law 95-164   "	Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) certification for working underground and in mine entrances "	General liability insurance with limits of not less than $1 million   "	Current and active California Contractor License "	Current CPR and first aid certificates "	Certified welders

<DESC>Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) plans to recompete its contract for integrating Measurement and Signals Intelligence (MASINT) within the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System.  The Contractor selected to fulfill the requirements of this SOW shall be required to operate integrated MASINT capabilities within AF DCGS.   Specifically, the Contractor shall maintain the detailed framework upon which thorough operational planning and system development is accomplished.  The end result is to maintain the established functional/program management, maintain and implement Concepts of Operations (CONOPs)/Tactics, Techniques and Procedures, maintain the TPED capability/capacity commensurate with current and future sensors, establish a training program, and ensure adequate communications infrastructure resources.  More specifically the Contractor will focus on AF DCGS capability to handle MASINT tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (TPED).  The System Administrator/Information System Security Officer (Sys Admin/ISSO) positions will be filled to address historical shortfalls in the USAF for these skill sets.  These personnel will be utilized by the assigned unit to perform Sys Admin/ISSO functions related to the unit’s mission, not limited specifically to support the AF DCGS MASINT equipment/software.  The AF DCGS is a system of systems architecture composed of fixed and deployable, scalable and modular ISR ground station components that provide multi-source intelligence to the warfighter.  These components are connected via a secure wide area network (WAN) to create a virtual multi-INT tasking, processing, exploitation and dissemination (TPED) environment.  The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. The AF DCGS is part of the overall DoD DCGS architecture.  The AF DCGS is worldwide; with core location Distributed Ground Systems (DGSs), remote sites, and the DCGS Processing Exploitation, and Dissemination System (PEDS) Architecture (DPA).  In addition, other organizations provide support, directly and indirectly, to AF DCGS.  The AF DCGS provides integrated and flexible, multi-discipline intelligence satisfying warfighter requirements for all phases of military operations.   The system simultaneously tasks and receives, processes, exploits and disseminates data from national, theater, tactical, and commercial collection assets in a distributed environment.  It supports national, joint, combined, and AF operations.  It is capable of forward deployed, distributed (split-based), and in-garrison reachback operations.  Initial Operating Capability (IOC) was established 15 December 2002.
All services requested under this contract are non-personal in nature.   The anticipated contract award date is 17 Mar 06.  The performance period is projected to be a 6 month base period with 4 one year option periods.     The NAICS code for this effort is anticipated to be 541990.     A determination regarding the set aside status for this effort has not been made.  This is not a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and no contract will result from this synopsis, nor does it commit the Government to any acquisition for these services.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, and the Government will not pay for any information received.     Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.     

In an effort to streamline the information sharing process, the Government intends to post copies of current contract information, draft documents associated with the solicitation, and questions and answers relating to the acquisition on the FedBizOps website (www.fedbizopps.gov).

<RESPDATE>122205
<CONTACT>Erin Brakensiek, 703-432-3716
<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  The Marine Corps Systems Command is conducting a survey of potential sources for a non-gasoline burning outboard engine (NBOE).  The request is for systems that meet Naval Sea Systems Command Program Management Sea 399 (NAVSEA PMS 399) protocol for sub-sea operations. The objective of the system is to increase effectiveness compared to current gasoline-burning outboard engines in use.  The function of the system will be to power the currently fielded Zodiac F470 Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) during small boat operations in demanding sea states (SS) across a spectrum of conflicts.  Mission profiles will consist of tactical movements of Marine raid and reconnaissance forces from over the horizon, requiring one-way transits in excess of 20 nautical miles.  Optimal required system performance will be achieved in SS 2, with a mission duration of 12 hours.  The NBOE must support conventional operations in SS 3, and special operations that are conducted in SS 4. The NBOE should meet all mission performance objectives while powering a CRRC with a total combat load of 2,018 lbs.  The operational temperature range is 28 degrees Fahrenheit to 98 degrees Fahrenheit (28F – 98F) water temperature and -25 degrees Fahrenheit to 128 degrees Fahrenhei!  t (-25F – 128F) air temperature.  The engine must operate on the following multiple fuel types:  diesel (DFM), JP-5, JP-8, and gasoline (gas/oil mixture if 2-stroke). The engine must be capable of fitting through a U.S. Navy submarine hatch.  The fuel system must have the capability to purge any water ingested when the CRRC capsizes in surf.  This ensures the ability to rapidly restart the engine.   The engine must be 3-man portable (threshold), 2-man portable (objective).  The power head must have a flushing system with the ability to connect to a garden hose.  The engine must be submersible to 66 feet of seawater while enclosed in a dry bag supplied with the engine (threshold) or without a dry bag (objective).  The engine must be compliant with EPA emission regulations.  A full Contractor Logistics Support package is needed to support all maintenance above Echelon I (User Level). Please include the willingness of the company to participate in a demonstration of their product.    MARCORSYSCOM will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the requested information.  Industry firms capable of providing the required systems, in whole, are invited to submit a response to this notice.  MARCORSYSCOM anticipates using the GSA schedule for this opportunity although interested parties not on the GSA schedule are encouraged to participate.  Firms should identify/submit a copy of their GSA schedule, if applicable.  Firms should also include literature, brochures, price lists, current design and production status, estimated production capacity, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  At a minimum, the capabilities summary should include system description, weight, and dimensions.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice for the following requirement.  Only those firms qualifying as a Small Business should respond.


This Performance Work Statement sets forth the requirements for an integrator to provide and install ten commercially available off-the-shelf multichannel NTSC television break-away/automation systems which are already currently offered for sale to commercial broadcasters and cable system operators.  Each of these systems shall playout eight independent channels and be scalable for future expansion.  These systems will enable American Forces Radio and Television Servcie (AFRTS) manned affiliates at ten geographically separated locations to automatically and manually insert commercial breaks (spot material) into network programming streams and provide long and short form programming throughout a broadcast day in the event that network feeds are lost.

Locations for this contract are:
	Operating Location-A, Detachment 4 AFNEWS, FELTWELL, England
	Detachment 6 AFNEWS, LAJES, Azores
	Detachment 7 AFNEWS, INCIRLIK, Turkey
	Detachment 8 AFNEWS, AVIANO, Italy
	Detachment 9 AFNEWS, SPANGDAHLEM, Germany
	Detachment 10 AFNEWS, YOKOTA (TOKYO), Japan
	Detachment 11 AFNEWS, OKINAWA, Japan
	Detachment 12 AFNEWS, MISAWA, Japan
	Detachment 13 AFNEWS, IWAKUNI, Japan
        Detachment 14 AFNEWS, SASEBO, Japan
	 
Each of these locations receives primary programming from the Network headquarters, Defense Media Center-Broadcast Center (DMC-BC), Riverside, California via satellite service to Europe and the Pacific.  There exists in addition to the local automation requirement a requirement for transcoding of material using Anystream Agility to provide product to an automation system already owned by the Government and used in Germany.

4.1.	System Concept
The basic system concept is for the Television Break-away/Automation System to insert local spot breaks and News into the AFRTS program stream.  Schedules for each of the eight channels are provided by Network headquarters, also referred to as the DMC-BC, 3-5 days in advance and indicate the break times or “avails” in which to insert local products. Local manipulation of the scheduled breaks does not normally occur. For the purposes of this document the terms “spot”, “product”, “interstitial material”, “short form” or “long form”  are synonymous in that they refer to television program material produced or recorded in-house for air at a later time.

Our simplified TV automation concept for this award covers three main areas of functionality. 
a.	The Playlist Management System, residing at the User layer, which interfaces to the AFRTS Network schedules. It also plans schedules,  provides reports, and controls the automation software. Ingest plays a prominent role in this area as well.  Most program material will be ingested from Avid Unity® and not controlled by the play-out automation system.  These files will require format conversion to the internal format of the transmission servers.  It is important that this process also writes the metadata required by the automation system so that it can recognize the material once it is ingested.  The automation system shall also be able to control a local VTR to ingest material directly into the transmission servers in the event of failure of either Avid or Contractor Provided transcoder.  

b. The middle applications such as  “automation” software which controls the hardware through machine control servers; “playlist” software which receives commands from both the traffic layer and the automation layer; performs monitoring & tracking function, “database and library” software; and other programs designed to mesh the different areas into a unified delivery system. Transcoding also occurs within this area.
 
c. The hardware  which actually performs transcoding, stores material and streams it to air. For the purposes of this document, playout servers may also be called channel servers, cache, edge, transmission or streaming servers. All storage configurations offered must offer seamless delivery of product in the event of a failure in any portion of the configuration.  It is important to note that total redundancy is a critical evaluation item. Downstream keyers and Character Generator are also located in this area.  Character generator will be used for onscreen messaging on a channel-selectable or all-channels basis. DSK will be used for channel branding.  Both shall be controlled either manually or through the playlist as scheduled events.

4.2.	System Reliability

Guaranteed reliability and protection of media and media delivery streams is a fundamental requirement.  All systems evaluated will be assessed against potential single-points of failure.  All systems will be judged as to the level of media protection, server protection, and software failsafes offered in the basic system.   


4.3.	Common Operating Environment 

The following information is provided to describe those characteristics which are common among all ten overseas locations in regards to the source of our programming, the cues used to trigger insertion events, the current playlist system and methods for accomplishing these things.

Programming Stream: 
Each of the ten stations currently receives a statistically multiplexed MPEG stream containing ten TV services and 15 radio services. This satellite stream originates at the Network headquarters, also referred to as AFRTS-DMC-BC, Riverside, CA 92518. It is decoded to composite video with separate audio.  Any solution offered must take this into account when considering switvjing or ingest. At present, insertion only occurs on four channels using a custom modified Avid Airplay®.  Our intent is to completely remove and replace the Airplay.  Any system provided under this award shall provide eight channels of locally automated insertion plus content transcoding and delivery management of content.  

Scheduling: The scheduling of programming streams occurs at the AFRTS-DMC-BC and utilizes Encoda’s BMS traffic system.  Break schedules are currently provided manually to affiliate stations as tab delimited text for importing as playlists. These schedules are then manually converted through a small conversion program, and local product information is inserted into local break availabilities.  Any system awarded under this solicitation must provide automatic ingest of schedule information.

Number of Playout Channels:  Each location will require automation capable of sustaining eight channels of local insertion 

Cueing Source:  Each of the satellite streams received contains between 3 and 12 sub-audible cue tones ranging from 25hz-35Hz.  These tones are locked to the video stream.  These tones are then decoded to a specific cue through the use of Wegener tone decoders which provide momentary dry contact closures.  The following table outlines various cues used by the DMC-BC to initiate events.

INTERESTED FIRMS SHOULD E MAIL KAREN BEYER at karen.beyer@gsa.gov no later than 12/07/2005.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available dark fiber infrastructure between Capitol Hill and an Alternate Computing Facility within the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. area. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The United States House of Representatives (USHR or House) is soliciting industry for information related to dark fiber availability in the metropolitan area to enable future growth of communications between the primary and alternate data centers supporting the House. The focus of this solicitation is to provide House Communications and Business Continuity staff with a general understanding of dark fiber services that are available within the area, and the complexity of acquiring and activating dark fiber for future use. This information would serve as the foundation for a comprehensive and scalable solution that would be incorporated into the House Wide Area Network. The House is interested in obtaining information pertaining to but not limited to the following: 1. Current or proposed buried dark fiber infrastructure located within the metropolitan area. 2. Current capacity of buried dark fiber infrastructure. 3. Current or proposed route diversity of buried dark fiber infrastructure. 4. Current or proposed ownership of buried dark fiber and intermediate patch and co-location facilities. 5. Sampling of fiber loss standards for current or proposed buried dark fiber infrastructure and type of buried dark fiber. 6. Sampling of Service Level Agreements in place with existing users of buried fiber infrastructure including but not limited to maximum time to repair and credit criteria. 7. Sampling of Service Level Agreements in place with existing users of co-location facilities. 8. Method and procedures for allowing customer to monitor and troubleshoot assigned buried fiber plant. 9. Method, procedures and experience for supporting Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). 10. Method and procedures for provider monitoring of buried fiber plant. 11. List of currently supported customers and high level topology of network. 12. Rough order of magnitude (ROM) on pricing and availability via current government based contract (GSA/GWAC, etc.) USHR is located in downtown Washington, D.C. The facilities housing USHR consist of the United States Capitol, four main office buildings, and other smaller buildings clustered in an urban area encompassing an area of 0.8 square miles. The Alternate Computing Facility is located within the Metropolitan area; address information for this location will be provided under separate cover. Submittals should include examples of systems currently available to support the above specified operations, to include known locations where they are in use. Multiple systems may be proposed to meet the various needs specified, if appropriate. For currently available systems, proposals should include an estimate of lifecycle costs to include separate specification of purchase, implementation, and maintenance costs. New design efforts to meet the needs may be submitted; however, currently available systems are preferred. A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI. Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation. The USHR will not release any information – marked with a Proprietary legend – received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Legislative Branch of the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. Vendors may email their response no later than January 16, 2006 to jim.caskey@mail.house.gov; reference this RFI number and title in the subject line. Vendors may send hard copies to Office of Finance and Procurement, 356 Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515; reference RFI number and title on shipping label, and send email to jim.caskey@mail.house.gov identifying carrier and tracking number for follow-up through mail/package screening. Vendors may direct technical questions to Mr. Rich Zanatta via email at richard.zanatta@mail.house.gov. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the House. The House is not responsible for the accuracy or timeliness of information republished by third parties. The email addresses provided are not intended for other use, “subscription,” or solicitation purposes; this is an express “opt-out” notice.

<DESC>The purpose of this RFI is to determine the industry offerings to meet the needs of duplicating facilities that are running between 600,000 to 1,000,000 impressions per month on a single shift.   A single shift is defined as 8 hours per day 21 days per month for a total average month of 168 hours less 13 hours for mandatory employee training, equipment downtime, and customer production holds etc . . . leaving a total production month of 155 hours.  

 

Single devices that operate at 100CPM or greater and tandem devices will be considered. Machines that can not produce 1 million per month will have overtime hours factored into the comparison. 

 

Additionally, the vendor should factor in a throughput factor expressed in a percent that results in a speed less than the stated engine speed. Historically, DAPS has tracked the throughput at approximately 90% for the type of work produced. This throughput is similar to what industry reports. As an example if the device offered runs 130CPM, the throughput would be calculated by 130CPM X 60 Minutes X 155 Productive Hours X .9 = 1,088,100.

 

If interested in submitting a response to this RFI, you must contact Darren Crowden, DAPS HQ, for an Excel spreadsheet containing specific equipment, features and pricing questions that will need to be filled out and submitted by the due date of this RFI.  Contact information is below:

<SUBJECT>66 -- Industry Day for the Common Avionics Display (CAD)
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209), will host an Industry Day for the Common Avionics Display (CAD).  Event details are planned as follows:  When: Thursday December 15, 2005 from 08:00 AM to 4:00 PM  Where: at the Hampton Inn, located outside the main gate to the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Lexington Park, Maryland.  The purpose of this initial industry day meeting is to provide the Navy an opportunity to communicate to industry its objectives and expectations for the CAD program; and to enlist industry support for a series of integrated product team (IPT) meetings to identify capabilities, opportunities and technology trends for a family of common avionic displays that will meet the spectrum of Navy applications.  Specifically, the U.S. Navy seeks to obtain information relative to current and/or future avionics display capabilities that promote commonality across a wide range of applications.  Displays will be used in a wide variety of applications and installations ranging from primary flight in the open/closed cockpits to tactical operations in crew consoles.  The forthcoming CAD program will create a family of displays that employ open architecture principles to ensure total ownership costs are affordable for all level of requirements.  The CAD program will encompass displays that support both centralized and distributed processing avionics architectures.  Initial launch platforms for CAD will likely include helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft.  Platforms targeted for the Common Avionics Display could eventually include all legacy, in-production, and future aircraft.  Ideally, the CAD would be a modular and scalable system with an open architecture to enable commonality of major sub-components between the end-item displays used in different aircraft.  For example, the same display head assembly module could be mated to two different Input/Output (I/O) modules and installed in two different aircraft performing vastly different functions.  The physical, electrical, and functional interfaces between these modules would be open, non-proprietary, based upon commercial standards, and easily implemented by third parties.  Any CAD design should greatly reduce development cycle time and cost for redeploying an end-item display for a new platform to include final integration.  The initial CAD family will be built upon the most advanced technologies available with improved optical performance (luminance ranges, contrast ratio, viewing angles, and NVIS compatibility), next-generation processing performance, and high-bandwidth video/data interfaces.  Significantly increased MTBF is also a key requirement.  The modular nature of the system will ensure simplified technology insertion when new technologies become available.  For example, the display head assembly could be replaced with a form, fit, and function assembly based upon advanced concept technology in future years.  Pre-registration for the Industry Day is required.  For reservations, e-mail Soya Clapp (soya@usdc.org) with the following information:  name, company, address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail NLT 09 December 2005.  Industry Day check-in is between 0730 and 0800.  The session will break for lunch between 1100 and 1200.  Draft Agenda for Industry Day includes 1. CAD Program Overview and Update; 2. Notional CAD performance expectations; 3. Question and Answer Session; and 4. Kickoff of CAD Working Group.  The U.S. Displays Consortium (USDC) will provide support for this Industry Day.  USDC is an industry-led, public/private partnership providing a common platform for flat panel display manufacturers and developers, FPD users, and the supplier base.  Technical questions concerning the CAD program should be directed to Mr. Jim Grubb at 301-757-6463 or by email at james.grubb@navy.mil.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Background

HR/REE has a requirement to attract and recruit qualified, diverse applicants into the U.S. Department of State.  The Department’s HR marketing group has determined, after reviewing secondary market research data, including total population, diversity composition, educational attainment, and geographic location (to coincide with Diplomat in Residence locations and diverse organizations’ annual national conferences), that customized, Department-specific recruiting/networking events should be a key part of its outreach efforts to attract culturally diverse, entrepreneurial, corporate, business and student professionals into the Department’s many Civil Service and Foreign Service programs. The Department determined that when considering the logistics of developing events of this scope and magnitude, it is necessary, from a time-efficiency and cost-effectiveness perspective to build a partnership with an organization that has experience in conducting events, as well as established relationships with minority organizations in selected markets. In addition, a proven track record with Federal customers, who have recruiting processes similar to the U.S. Department of State for both Civil and Foreign Service career opportunities, is required. 

Specifically, the contractor will serve as the event planner, in conjunction with the Department, for a series of career panel presentations and one-on-one networking events. These events will be known as U.S. Department of State “Careers in the Foreign Service Diversity Networking Nights” and will target local market educators, graduate students and alumni; targeted affiliate organizations; interest groups; local government representatives and business leaders.

Requirement
	
Under the scope of this project, the contractor must demonstrate the highest degree of professionalism, customer focus, adaptability, innovation, commitment and responsiveness in meeting, and exceeding, the Department’s expectations and driving targeted results.  The event planner will provide service for nine events, with five events tentatively set for January 9, 2006 through March 8, 2006, with specific dates for the remaining four to be determined at a later date..  It is expected that approximately 150 people will attend each of the events.  The Event planner will conduct outreach to prospective attendees and organize all events that are to be held in Atlanta, GA, San Antonio, TX, Houston, TX, Miami, FL, Raleigh, NC, Chicago, IL, Detroit, MI, New York, NY and Philadelphia, PA. In addition, the contractor will complete the following work:

(a)	Develop and implement nine (9) diversity-focused events for mid-career professionals using targeted online and offline programs, including marketing on website owned and operated by contractor; outreach to local media venues; communications with strategic partners and alliances; and electronic communications to promote customized events.  

(b)	Provide demographic market analysis and target market recommendations.

The contractor will provide in-depth market analysis for nine (9) U.S. markets, including, but not limited to:

Atlanta, GA;
San Antonio, TX;
Houston, TX;
Miami, FL;
Raleigh, NC;
