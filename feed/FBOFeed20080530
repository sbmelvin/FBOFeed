<DESC>The government intends on awarding a sole sourceacquisition for geophysical analysis software fromHampson-Russell, a commercial seismic explorationsoftware development corporation..  The BIA has amandated responsibility to provide technical advice toIndian mineral owners who want to develop oil and gasresources on their lands.   BIA accomplishes thisthrough careful and accurate data analysis ofgeophysical data as part of BIAs compliance with theIndian Mineral Development Act of 1982 (Public Law97-382, 25 USC 2106) and the Energy Policy Act of2005, Title V  Indian Energy (Public Law 109-58, 25USC 3502).Hampson-Russell will provide software media,licensing, and maintenance for their Emerge andStrata software packages. Emerge estimates variouspetrophysical rock properties from well logs andprocessed seismic data and interpolates thoseproperties in a horizon-consistent sense betweenestablished control points. Strata performs seismicinversion of processed seismic data to estimateacoustic impedance and other properties and thusserves as a source for part of the informationrequired by Emerge.
Additionally, several invaluable utility programs areincluded which serve to integrate seismic and welldata with the results. These include comprehensivewell and seismic databases, surface and subsurfacemapping, 2D and 3D automated horizon picking, 3Dvisualization, synthetic seismogram generation, andothers. The modular nature of the package provides forseamless integration of current programs (Emerge andStrata) as well as any additional modules which may bepurchased in the future.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed purchase contract to the Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH), 1101 15th Street NW Suite 910, Washington DC, 20005-5002 to assist the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) with Division of Strategic Recruitment (DSR) CMS Public Health Fellows Program. The Office of Operations Management (OOM) Human Capital Management Group (HCMG), Division of Strategic Planning (DSR) has developed a strategic recruitment plan that requires the collaboration and partnership with academic institutions and affiliation groups in an effort to hire Fellows.  The Fellows will be assigned to work on special projects that staff would otherwise not be able to support within the following CMS components: Office of Policy (OP), Centers for Medicare Management (CMM), Office of Research, Development and Information (ORDI), and Office of Clinical Standards and Quality (OCSQ). The focus of these special projects will include assisting in the writing of policy and initiatives that research new insights and innovative solutions to health problems, providing guidance, and monitoring quality standards. In the course of partnering with graduate schools and affiliates of public health, CMS will demonstrate its support for public health education and the public health profession; in addition to becoming an employer-of-choice.  
In order to fulfill this undertaking, it will require that the contractor have an established procedure for providing a highly skilled cadre of qualified applicants that are recent (graduated less than five years ago) graduates of a Masters or Doctorate program that offer graduate degrees in public health related fields, and accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH). Proposed fellows may still be enrolled at a School of Public Health (SPH) at the time of application submission, but must receive their degree prior to the expected start of the CMS Public Health Fellows Program. The contractor also must be able to verify the credentials of each candidate and supply supporting documentation for the Fellows that ensures they are equipped with the skill set and educational requirements that are in line with those established by CMS.  The contractor must also ensure that the candidates understand the mission of CMS. The proposed fellows must be a U.S. citizen to be eligible for the Fellowship Program. Fellows will be chosen to work in the Baltimore Central Office for one year.
To our knowledge, ASPH is the only organization that has demonstrated extensive knowledge in this capacity. Based upon past experiences in other federal agencies, an understanding of the federal sector, the existing relationship with schools of public health, and market research, ASPH is determined to be the only responsible source for the effort and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agencys requirements.
All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the address below and must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) System. CMS program officer shall make the determination of what would constitute equivalent expertise. If you submitted a capability statement in response to market research previously, you need not submit again.
The period of performance is for 1 year. NAICS CODE IS 611710

<DESC>The DARPA Strategic Technology Office (STO) is looking to develop the next generation Network Centric Radio System (NCRS), with additional capabilities and an assured affordable unit price to the user.  DARPA envisions two critical technologies for achieving these new goals:  1) a backbone radio architecture that enables a versatile Internet Protocol (IP) network and 2) a radio gateway that enables legacy analog and digital communications systems to be internetworked.  As with NCRS, the MAINGATE will enable heterogeneous groups of radios to be integrated into a heterogeneous network tolerant to high latency and packet loss.  The technologies developed for the program will permit affordable, tactical, real-time, high fidelity video, data, and voice services to be deployed in a networked environment to support tactical operations in either Maneuver or Dismounted operations.  As a result of this effort, DARPA expects a clear demonstration of advanced mobile ad hoc network (MANET) gateway technology that will incorporate a wireless IP-capable network (WIPN), which provides interconnectivity between nodes bridging heterogeneous mixtures of radio networks.  A unique characteristic of the MAINGATE program is the integration of a default IP radio network as part of the gateway.

1.  INTRODUCTION:  The Air Force Small Business Solutions Center Mentor-Protg Office is soliciting WHITE PAPERS from eligible mentors interested in participating in the Department of Defense (DoD) Mentor-Protg Program.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  Those WHITE PAPERS found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal in accordance with (IAW) this BAA, subject to need and the availability of funds.  This BAA announcement will remain in effect until 30 September 2008.

IAW Section Two of the Presidential Executive Order 13360, and in order to significantly increase contract and subcontract award opportunities to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), we highly encourage SDVOSBs participate as protgs or mentors (if eligible) in the program.

2.  OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this Department of Defense (DoD) program is to provide incentives to prime DoD contractors to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the protg firms to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements.  This is accomplished by technical and developmental assistance from the mentor to the protg.  Under this program, approved mentor firms will enter into Mentor-Protg agreements with eligible protgs.  A complete description of the DoD program and eligibility requirements is provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).  In addition, you can visit the Air Force Small Business Website at http://www.selltoairforce.org/programs/mentorprotege/default.aspx to obtain detailed Air Force MP Program information.  Proposed agreements consisting primarily of business infrastructure, management and marketing assistance will not be considered for approval. The Air Force is focusing on Mentor-Protg agreements that have a strong technical component or focus on innovative state of the art technology transfer in the domains of air, space and cyberspace.  Some technical categories are listed below.

The period of performance for each contract awarded shall be one year from the date of award, with a one-year option.  If proposed mentoring efforts require a second option year, justification of the additional year shall be provided in the WHITE PAPER.   The amount of individual awards will vary according to the complexity of the effort proposed and cannot exceed the regulatory yearly amount as set forth in DFARS, Appendix I.

PHASE ONE  WHITE PAPER

4.  WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION:  WHITE PAPERS must be received no later than COB on 20 June 2008 and shall be mailed to the following two addresses:  

AFDW/A7KS					AFOPO/CCP

Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.
  
a.  CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION:  Mentors are required to submit 3 hard copies to the AFOPO/CCP address and 2 hard copies to the AFDW/A7KS address of the white paper, not to exceed 10 pages, single spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch summarizing their proposed mentoring approach.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of a mentor whose proposed assistance is not in-line with program objectives as described in paragraph 2.  The white paper shall be structured and completed as follows: 

Section A:  Mentor Company Name & POC Contact Information; Protg Company Name & POC Contact Information; School Name & POC Contact Information.

Section C:  Provide description of mentors current/past relationship with the protg and the results/progress of protg firms mentored by your company.  

Section D:  Provide anticipated approach, description, and timeline of the technology transfer, business development, and infrastructure assistance proposed to be transferred to the protg.  Technology transfer must equate to no less that 70% of the total proposed effort.

Section E:  Provide description and details to include training courses or seminars that will be provided to the Protgs by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs), Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs), or Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs).  

Section F:  Provide description of the benefits to the DoD/AF from the proposed mentoring and provide the name and phone number of the Air Force Technical Advisor/Champion if available.

Section G:  Provide anticipated mentor subcontracting to the protg.

Section H:  Provide an estimated value for proposed technical and business mentoring efforts.
       
b.  WHITE PAPER EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:

(1)  Relevance of proposed technology to current DoD/AF requirements as listed in paragraph 2.

(2)  Overall technical approach to providing transfer of technology.

(3)  Capacity, capability and proposed metrics to achieve the objectives of this BAA.

c.  WHITE PAPER NOTICES / REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be requested to submit a technical and cost proposal, subject to available funding.  Proposals will be due 30 calendar days from receipt of notification letter sent by the Contracting Officer.  This invitation does not ensure that the mentor will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner with reasoning for non-selection. 

PHASE TWO  REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL

5.  PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be evaluated against the technical criteria as listed in paragraph 6.b below.  Proposals that represent one or more of the top technical categories as listed in paragraph 2 will result in a more favorable ranking.  Proposals will be ranked from the highest to lowest based upon a subjective evaluation performed by the Air Force evaluation team, based upon DoD/AFs requirements and focused areas.  Awards will be made starting at the highest ranked proposal, descending down in order, for all technically acceptable proposals, contingent upon availability of funding, successful completion of negotiations, and current Air Force requirements.

(1)  Comprehensive Needs Assessment:  Demonstrate a comprehensive Protg needs assessment was performed prior to proposal submittal by summarizing the results of the needs assessment. Example needs assessment templates are available on the Sell to Air Force Website - http://www.selltoairforce.org/programs/mentorprotege/mp_examples.aspx. Variations and modifications to the example templates are acceptable to best reflect the results of the protg needs assessment.  The needs assessment should focus on technology and developmental assistance within the identified technical categories set forth in paragraph 2.  Color coding, numeric ranking or similar means of priority needs assessment results is recommended and highly encouraged.  The government may validate the comprehensive needs assessment using either internal MP Program personnel or an outside independent agency.
  
(2)  Technical Approach to Needs Assessment:  Identify relevant technologies set forth in paragraph 2, business infrastructure and developmental areas using the Tech Approach Outline example template at http://selltoairforce.org/programs/mentorprotege/mp_examples.asp.  Tailor this template to provide a thorough description of the specific approach to address the technology and developmental areas identified in the needs assessment.  Describe what, when, and how the assistance will be provided and by whom (e.g., OJT, workshops, seminars, development or update of business plans, HBCU/MI, PTAC, SBDC).  Describe involvement of HBCU/MI, PTAC and SBDC faculty and interns.  Variations and modifications to the example template are acceptable to best reflect the proposed Technical Approach.

(a)  Technology transfer must equate to no less that 70% of the total proposed effort. 

(b)  The AF mandates a minimum 5% requirement of total proposed contract value for HBCU/MI, PTAC and/or SBDC subcontracting.

The actual categories and task descriptions are dependent on the contractors approach and cost accounting system.  The costs shall be presented in Excel format, with formulas, and the spreadsheets shall not be locked.  If they are not presented in Excel format, they will be considered non-responsive.   Mentors shall provide proposed cost data for each year proposed, not to exceed two (2) years, unless a second option year is pre-approved (see paragraph 3).  Hours and dollar values associated with technology transfer should be not less that 70% of the total proposed labor hours and costs, and must track to each technology and developmental assistance category proposed in Volume Two (Technical Volume).  Volume Three shall contain separate specific costs that show which costs are clearly attributable to the 70% transfer of desired technology, and the 30% attributable transfer to business related items.

(2)  Provide adequate, realistic and auditable support for all labor, travel and incidental costs proposed for both the prime and authorized subcontractors (protg, HBCU/MI, PTAC, SBDC).

(3)  Provide copy of rate approval letter for approved forward pricing rates and identify the cognizant DCAA office.

(4)  Provide all travel expenses broken out by individual trip with justification.

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST/TI.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell EMC DAE2 2Gb Disk Array Enclosure.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/II requires this additional SAN shelf to provide capacity for  a potential growth of 40% of applicants.  Per the manufacturer, the DAE2 (2-gigabit disk-array enclosure) is a highly available, high-performance, high-capacity storage system that uses a Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) as its interconnect interface.  An enclosure connects to another DAE2 or a storage processor, and is managed by storage-system software in RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disk) configurations.  The enclosure is only 3U (5.25 inches) high, but can include 15 hard disk drives.  Its modular, scalable design provides additional disk storage as your needs increase.  The DAE2 can support up to fifteen 3.5-inch, Fiber Channel disk modules.  It uses the Fiber Channel interface to connect disk modules together.  Simple serial cabling provides easy scalability.  You can interconnect as many as eight DAE2s to Fiber Channel loops (sometimes called busses) to form a large disk storage system.  The number of loops depends on the capabilities of your storage processor; highly available configurations require at least two loops, other configurations use a single loop.  You can place the disk enclosures in the same cabinet, or in one or more separate cabinets.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The Dell EMC DAE2 2Gb Disk Array Enclosure is required as the EDV program is currently housed and processed on DELL equipment.  The requested DELL Disk Drives will be an upgrade to the existing equipment and is the only product that the DELL vendor will support.The Dell EMC DAE2 2Gb Disk Array Enclosure has undergone test and assessment and has received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Perk Grindstone Unit 7 Mastication:  The contractor shall furnish all technical expertise, labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals necessary to complete the work required.

The bidder is advised to visit the worksite to determine average cut trees per acre prior to submitting a bid.  The bidder is responsible for determining the amount of work.  Bids will be reviewed by a committee and award will be made upon selection criteria defining the best benefit to the government.  

Description of Work-Perk Grindstone Matication unit 7.  This contract is designed to reduce hazardous fuels, and restore public lands.  The Perk Grindstone Mastication  Project is described in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Perk-Grindstone Fuel Reduction Project..  The project will contribute to the central priority of restoration of fire-adapted systems by reducing intensities of wildfires, especially in the wildland urban interface (WUI) as well as Public lands, and restoring natural ecologic processes across a range of forest vegetation types.  Additionally, the project would provide forest products to the local community and enhance watershed conditions (i.e., water quality and quantity).   The project areas are within dense stands of mixed conifer, ponderosa pine, and ponderosa pine associated woodlands that are at high risk of stress-induced bark beetle attack, as well as a risk of wildfire.  This thinning will enhance residual tree vigor and thus reduce the chances for tree mortality.  Treatment of the resulting woody debris and slash will make the residual stand more fire resistant into the future and begin to restore natural function and sustainability.  To accomplish these goals, this project includes treatment by  mastication. Although burning is not apart of this Contract, many areas treated by this Contract is a preparatory step toward its use.

<DESC>IRS ASFR-EASE Project
Request for Information

The purpose of the Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and to assist the IRS in considering the use Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) products for implementation of the modernized version of the Automated Substitute for Return (ASFR) system currently in use today.  Your response to this RFI will be used to make a determination on the IRS potential use of COTS product as an alternative to custom development. Current System Description: ASFR is a batch system written in the COBOL language.  Essentially, this system works with individual taxpayers that have been identified as non-filers by other IRS systems.  These other systems provide basic account information for a taxpayer based on third-party filings such as W-2s, 1099s, etc. 
ASFR has several functions, broadly defined as follows: 1. Preparing a substitute return on the taxpayers behalf.  2. Generating letter content for letters to taxpayers as defined by federal statute.  3. Tracking calls from the taxpayer regarding the return substitute.  4. Tracking correspondence to and from the taxpayer regarding the return substitute, including undeliverable correspondence.  5. Finalizing the return substitute as an official tax return.  6. Reconciling the return substitute with an actual tax return subsequently filed by the taxpayer.  7. Posting transaction codes to other IRS systems as needed to reflect changes in status of the return substitute and taxpayers account.  8. Limited executive reporting.  Aspects of a Successful Modernized System:  The modernized system being proposed has several key capabilities.  The new system will be a complete rewrite of the old system, keeping the current business functionality and adding a modest amount of new business capabilities.  The ASFR-EASE project is envisioned as a multi-release effort over several years.  IRS views elements of a successful ASFR-EASE system as follows: (a) Conforms to the target Enterprise Architecture. (b) Provides the ability to change business rules in a dynamic fashion by non-technical users.  (c) Provides a real-time web-based interface.  (d) Available to a wider internal IRS audience.  (e) Utilizes modern RDBMS databases.  (f) Supports Web Services. (g) Utilizes modern reporting tools.  (h) Supports IRS single sign-on technology.  (i) Shortens or eliminates batch cycles in use today.  (j) Is expandable consistent with future release plans.  (k) Integrates with other case management solutions. (l) Integrates with IRS document management strategies (Documentum).  Application Requirements: Much of the evaluation criteria center around application requirements as documented in this section.  These requirements are separated by broad categories in the sections that follow: Enterprise Architecture Requirements (EA):  It is beyond the scope of this analysis to list all Enterprise Architecture (EA) requirements.  These may be found in the IRS Enterprise Architecture.  For evaluation purposes, the evaluation team will look at the following aspects of the proposed solution in terms of the IRS Enterprise Architecture: (1) Solution must operate in one of the approved operating environments.  These include either Sun Solaris or Microsoft server environments. (2) Solution must utilize an Oracle database if operating in a Solaris environment or the MS SQL Server database if operating in a Microsoft environment. (3) Data maintained by the system must be able to use Business Objects for reporting. (4) Solution must support Services Oriented Architecture with real-time integration with a WebMethods Integration Broker. (5) Solution must integrate with an IRS Portal architecture, which provides for user authentication and authorization Other Technical Requirements.  The Enterprise Architecture only covers a portion of technical requirements for the project.  These requirements also apply to ASFR-EASE: (a) Solution must be able to access external Oracle databases for reference information. (b) Solution must be able to access flat files for data feeds by utilizing an EA-compliant ETL tool (e.g. Informatica) (c) Solution must be able to reasonably handle 500 concurrent users.  There are approximately 1500 users in the universe. (d) Solution must have the ability to recognize duplicate customer records. (e) Solution must have capability of creating a best-of-breed record from multiple source records.

- Proposed Issue Date: June 16, 2008
- Title of Project:  Land Restoration and Land Clearing
- Description:  The work of this contract will restore formerly developed areas of Everglades National Park. Over 7,000 acres of Everglades National Park consists of formerly developed land that was once farmed, graded and filled for roads or filled for some other purpose. Local agricultural practices included rock plowing, which breaks up underlying bedrock and dramatically alters soil structure. Agricultural fields were often heavily fertilized, resulting in nutrient rich soils, not at all typical of the very nutrient-poor Everglades. In south Florida, previously farmed or filled areas rapidly fill up with dense communities of exotic plants. The drained, artificially nutrient-enriched soils on these sites support such luxuriant plant growth that management of exotics in these areas is impractical. The park has developed techniques for restoring former agricultural or filled sites that restore natural conditions, promote native vegetation communities and minimize the need for ongoing exotic plant control. Over 3000 acres of previously farmed land in the Hole-in-the-Donut area of the park has already been successfully restored using these techniques. Many of the additional areas to be restored are in the East Everglades addition lands, though others are scattered throughout the park. In all, the project would complete the restoration of over 7,000 acres of highly disturbed land and improve the habitat quality and wetland function of a large area surrounding the restoration project.
- Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) service contract with one base year and four option years will be considered for award requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.
- Estimated annual price range: $2 million minimum and $24 million maximum.
- Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
- All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.
- It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories.
- In order to be considered for award, all large businesses will be required to submit an acceptable Small, HUBZone Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-owned, Veteran-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan with their proposal.   The NPS subcontracting goals for Fiscal Year 2007 for the participation of small businesses at a minimum are as follows:  Small Business Concerns - 19%; Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns - 3%; Small Women-Owned Business Concerns - 5%; HUBZone Small Business Concerns - 3%; Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns - 3%; Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Concerns - 3%; 8(a) concerns - 2.5%.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THE US ARMY AVIATION AND MISSILE COMMAND INTENDS TO PROCURE, ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS FROM SIMMONDS PRECISION PRODUCTS, INCORPORATED (GOODRICH) A MINIMUM OF 32 UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 1,000 INTEGRATED VEHICLE HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (IVHMS) KITS,  UP TO 6,650  DEPLOYMENT SPARES PACKAGES AND UP TO 342 IVHMS PECULIAR GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (GSE) KITS TO SUPPORT THE HEALTH MONITORING FOR UH-60A/L AIRCRAFT.  THE IVHMS KIT PROVIDES VEHICLE HEALTH MONITORING AND CRASH SURVIVABILITY DATA TO ASSIST IN MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION.  THE IVHMS KIT CONSISTS OF THE INTEGRATED VEHICLE HEALTH MANAGEMENT UNIT (IVHMU), SENSORS FOR DIAGNOSTICS AND ROTOR SMOOTHING, AND ASSOCIATED PARTS.
THE IVHMS INCLUDES THE REMOTE DATA CONCENTRATOR (RDC), WHICH PROVIDES ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL (A/D) DATA CONVERSION CRUCIAL TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONDITION BASED MAINTENANCE (CBM) ON NON-BUSED (UH-60A/L) AIRCRAFT.  THE ABSENCE OF A DIGITAL DATA BUS MEANS THAT A DEVICE LIKE THE RDC IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE DIGITAL DATA COMMUNICATION AND PROCESSING.  CBM IS MAINTENANCE BASED UPON EVIDENCE OF NEED.  THAT EVIDENCE IS ACQUIRED BY ONBOARD SYSTEMS, LIKE IVHMS, AND PROCESSED OFF AIRCRAFT BY SYSTEMS THAT ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE ARMY LOGISTICS ENTERPRISE INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE PURPOSE OF CBM IS TO REDUCE THE MAINTENANCE BURDEN AND THE  LOGISTICS FOOTPRINT OF FIELDED SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY LEGACY SYSTEMS LIKE THE UH-60A/L, SO THAT THEY CAN BE AFFORDABLY SUSTAINED.
THE IVHMU INCLUDES AN INTEGRATED COCKPIT VOICE/FLIGHT DATA RECORDER (CV/FDR) AND UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC LOCATING BEACON (UALB).  THE FUTURE PURCHASES OF DEPLOYMENT SPARES PACKAGE WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE FIELDING SUPPORT TO COMBAT AVIATION BRIGADES (CABS). FUTURE GSE KIT PURCHASES ARE REQUIRED FOR IVHMS OPERATION AND CALIBRATION.
BECAUSE THESE ITEMS WILL BE UTILIZED TO SUPPORT THE VEHICLE HEALTH MONITORING AND CRASH SURVIVABILITY OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN DEPLOYED UH-60 BLACK HAWK AIRFRAMES, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AND THIS REQUIREMENT SHALL BE FILLED IN THE TIMELIEST MANNER POSSIBLE.  29 UH-60 IVHMS INSTALLATION  KITS ARE REQUIRED BY 30 JUNE 2008 AND 32 UH-60 IVHMS INSTALLATION KITS ARE REQUIRED BY 31 JULY 2008
THIS ITEM IS RESTRICTED TO SIMMONDS PRECISION PRODUCTS, INCORPORATED (D/B/A GOODRICH), FOUR COLISEUM CENTRE, 2730 WEST TYVOLA ROAD, CHARLOTTE, NC 28217.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT POSSESS SUFFICIENT, ACCURATE OR LEGIBLE DATA TO PURCHASE THIS PART FROM OTHER THAN THE CURRENT SOURCE.  IVHMS IS APPROVED FOR USE ON UH-60 AIRCRAFT VIA THE AIRWORTHINESS RELEASE (AWR) PROCESS, AND HAS COMPLETED ALL OF THE TESTING REQUIRED FOR FULL AIRWORTHINESS QUALIFICATION.  THERE IS NO OTHER SYSTEM THAT IS QUALIFIED OR APPROVED VIA AWR WHICH MEETS THE UTILITY HELICOPTERS PROJECT OFFICE (UHPO) REQUIREMENTS FOR CBM, INCLUDING FLIGHT REGIME RECOGNITION, WHICH IS A CRITICAL IVHMS CAPABILITY REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE CBM.  IN ORDER TO SUPPORT DEPLOYING AIRCRAFT, TIME AND FUNDING ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP AND QUALIFY A NEW SYSTEM BEFORE INITIAL DEPLOYMENTS OCCUR.  DURING DEPLOYMENTS TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, IVHMS EQUIPPED UNITS HAVE OPERATED THEIR AIRCRAFT AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER OPERATIONAL READINESS RATE! S IN HIGH OPERATIONAL TEMPO (OPTEMPO) ENVIRONMENTS THAN NON-EQUIPPED UNITS. 
ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302-1, OTHER INTERESTED SOURCES MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT A PROPOSAL.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  HOWEVER, ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES THAT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WILL BE GIVEN DUE CONSIDERATION BY THE GOVERNMENT.

<DESC>The FAA Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Information Technology Directorate has need of an application packaging toolset that integrates with its existing investment in BMC Remedy Help Desk and BMC Marimba IT application deployment software.  The ATO National Service Center (NSC) is deploying an ITIL-based Release Management capability and must be able topackage modify, test, and deploy COTS and custom applications as well as regular software patch updates in a widely distributed environment of 32,000 users.  Software packaging is an integral part of the process of deploying and installing server and desktop applications on equipment within a geographically dispersed organization from a remote location via an automated process.   Software packaging is the common practice of creating or customizing commercial, in-house developed, or legacy applications or programs into one set of installation files (e.g., some applications come bundled with optional components or options that need to be customized or preset for our business requirements).  The "packaged" applications may then be deployed to and automatically installed on remote servers and desktops via the FAA's current platform of BMC products.  
Therefore, the ATO has the requirement for a COTS application that will perform application packaging as well as meet the requirements specified below.
Requirements
The packaging solution will need to meet the following functional requirements, and provide capability to:
	Standardize applications on the MSI format, fully supporting Microsoft's Windows Installer Service and all its benefits such as self-healing, installation rollback, install-on-demand, advertising, and ability to specify conditions and transforms.	Automate the repackaging process with ability to convert all software, including legacy setup files, to standard MSI packages.  	Create customized packages; build transforms (MST) that safely modifies MSI packages to meet the specific needs of ATO user groups.	Run automated QA and validation tests to ensure software runs reliably	Support conflict resolution and QA testing for system conflicts against the ATO National Baseline Image, pre-determined custom validation rules, as well as conflict testing against Microsoft or other vendor security patches.	Ability to seamlessly hand off software packages to BMC's configuration management tool, Marimba, for deployment.	Store everything associated with a software package, such as binary files, source files, and related attachments in a single searchable database.  Must be compatible with our existing Oracle 10g environment. 	Allow for team based packaging so that members of an ATO virtual packaging team can check out, modify, and version control all packages under development via the web.	Ability to create, edit, and manage industry leading application virtualization technologies such as Thinstall (VMware) and Citrix software solutions. 	Able to support migration from Windows XP environment to Windows Vista OS.	Ability to provide reports demonstrating compliance, or non-compliance, with pre-determined performance metrics such as time to package or time to deploy, allowing for resource allocation with respect to packaging responsibilities.	Ability to create, re-create, and customize packages for multiple platforms including Linux, Pocket PC, cellular devices, and Windows mobile devices 	Ability to create, re-create, and customize packages for the Windows server environment.

Other Considerations
Offerors must also provide a detailed list of hardware requirements needed to support the comprehensive solution, and provide quote for classroom training at an on-site location for an estimated 12 to 15 packagers including hands-on assistance using the tools in the FAA ATO test and production environments.  

Market research performed by the FAA leads the FAA to conclude that there appears to be only one commercial product that can meet the above-noted requirements:  AdminStudio by Acresso Software.  The purpose of this announcement is to ascertain whether or not there are other commercially available products that meet the functional requirements noted above.  
For those entities who consider that they have a commercial product that meets the above-noted criteria, and they would like the FAA to consider their product, a response to this announcement is required.  All responses must be received by COB June 16, 2008.  The response must include the following:  
(1)  Clear indication as to which of the above-noted requirements the "proposed" product meets; (2)  A description of the proposed product including brand-name and product/part number; (3)  Pricing information explaining the normal commercial licensing and pricing structure and prices (e.g., by server licensing, by user licensing, and how much per server or per user); and   (4)  A list of at least three customers that have purchased the "proposed" product (including name of company, name of an individual and phone number to contact the named individual)
The FAA is not interested in working with a company to "develop" a product or application to perform the required functions.  Rather, the FAA is interested in purchasing existing technology that is currently commercially available and has been deployed with significant customers to substantiate and support a conclusion that the product is a proven and commercially viable product.  
Responses must be received on or before COB June 16, 2008.  Should the FAA not receive any responses to this announcement, the FAA will pursue a procurement to purchase the brand name product noted above:  AdminStudio by Acresso Software.  
Responses must be sent to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at:

<DESC>FedBizOps Synopsis - Airport Ground Support for Air Evacuations Within the U.S.

The Department of Homeland Security/ Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is seeking information that may assist the government in acquiring the services of the private sector to assist in establishing the capability to provide large-scale evacuation airport ground support. Specifically, FEMA is soliciting information to determine the availability of capable contractors that can develop, deploy, and operate such a capability. This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. FEMA reserves the right to accept, reject, or use without obligation or compensation any information submitted in response to this RFI. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.

Since much of FEMAs recent planning efforts have focused on the New Orleans International Airport (MSY) and developing the capability to assist in the safe and timely precautionary mass evacuation of the Critical Transportation Needs (CTN) and general (ambulatory) population, to pre-designated host states in the event of a major disaster, this RFI will generally focus on MSY and the Gulf Coast Region.  FEMA is considering creating a service area for this contract that would be inclusive of FEMA Region IV that includes the states of AL, GA, FL, KY, MS, NC, SC and TN as well as FEMA Region VI that includes the states of AR, LA, NM, OK and TX. The contractor would be required to accept an order placed for a location within the service area. FEMA could place an order for services outside the contract service area, if the contractor agreed to accept such an order.

FEMA considering awarding an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) commercial contract to a successful offeror for airport operations services to include above the wing passenger services, as well as below the wing ground support.  Initial efforts may include operational planning and will focus on MSY.  The potential contractor would also be expected to capable of receiving alerts, mobilizing, and deploying in order to assist in the evacuation of 20,000 CTN passengers during a 28 hour window within a hurricane disaster response planning timeline.  

FEMA is using a one year base period and four possible options of one year each for a total period of performance of sixty (60) months. Actual services would be acquired by placing an order against the contract. FEMA is currently considering a full and open competitive acquisition.  If FEMA does elect to obtain services from the private sector, a full and open competitive procurement to all eligible offerors is being considered.  The award of both firm fixed price and a time & materials contract line items is anticipated.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  All inquiries must be submitted in writing or electronic mail to the point of contact (POC).  No responses shall be accepted after 12 June 2008.  Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available.

<CONTACT>Deborah E. Joeckel, Contracting Officer, Phone (205) 731-0135 Ext. 32, Email deborah.joeckel@gsa.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit comments from potential sources from academia and industry on the solicitation approach and the clarity of the High Performance Computing Modernization Program Offices (HPCMPO) draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) for the User Productivity Enhancement, Technology Transfer and Training (PETTT) Program.   This RFI and the SOO may be viewed on the DoD HPCMP web site at http://www.hpcmo.hpc.mil/PETTT business_opps.htm .  The HPCMPO was established in 1993 to perform life cycle management and acquisition oversight for the High Performance Computing (HPC) needs of the defense Science and Technology (S&T) and Test and Evaluation (T&E) communities.  The purpose of the PETTT Program is to enable the flow of computational science and related technology and help fulfill the research and development objectives of the DoD high performance computing user community.  PETTT will focus on enhancing user productivity through technology transition, training and support.  The predecessor contract of the User Productivity Enhancement, Technology Transfer and Training (PETTT) activity has introduced tools and techniques from various computational communities and brokered collaborative activities with government agencies, industry, and academia.  The PETTT activity under this solicitation will further facilitate collaborations among DoD researchers and world-class institutions on computational problems of significant interest for national defense.  The Government anticipates the following solicitation approach for the PETTT contract: (1) this RFI, (2) a pre-proposal Bidders Response identifying a technical/management approach based on the SOO, and (3) a formal Technical/Management and Cost Proposal based on a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government will hold one-on-one bidders conferences with prospective bidders during the pre-proposal phase as well as the RFP phase.  Based on the bidders responses and the bidders conference during the pre-proposal phase, the Government will generate a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  This, together with the SOO will dictate the Governments requirements for PETTT and form the basis for a formal request for proposals (RFP) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the FAR Part 15.  The Government anticipates awarding a single Award Fee contract with a Base and four option periods. The Government envisions that the most productive form of the contract will result from a consortium of university and industry partners.  The expected award date is May 2009.  This is a Request for Information only.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this posting. Written responses to this RFI may be submitted to the General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Services, Assisted Acquisition Services Division, 950 22nd Street North, Suite 600, Birmingham, AL 35203, Attn. Ms. Deborah Joeckel, by 30 June 2008.  Electronic copies are preferred and should be sent via e-mail to deborah.joeckel@gsa.gov  with a copy to eddie.mills@gsa.gov in PDF format.

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT
<p>This is a sources sought announcement to seek potential vendors that could fulfill the below requirement. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The applicable NAICS code is 511210 Size Standard is $23.0. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of market research being conducted by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce to identify capable potential small business sources for the purchase of a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf Software Tool as described below. Based on the response to this Sources Sought, the Economic Development Administration will decide if this requirement will be set aside for small businesses, for a small business program (8a, HubZone, or Service Disabled Veteran), or done through full and open competition. Below is a highlight of services that is needed to be provided for EDA and attached is the Statement of Objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statement of Objectives<br />For the Purchase of a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf Software Tool that&nbsp;will&nbsp;Automate the EDA Balanced Scorecard Implementation</p>
<p>The Economic Development Administration (EDA), an agency within the Department of Commerce, recently revised and updated its Balanced Scorecard (BSC) strategic management implementation. EDA implemented the BSC several years ago to measure performance and to translate EDA's strategy and goals into a set of actions and initiatives. The newly revised BSC better quantifies EDA's current niche in the economic development community.</p>
<p>The EDA Balanced Scorecard features both financial and operational key performance metrics that measure the consequences of EDA resource investments on community economic development. There are separate scorecards for individual EDA offices, all of which are "rolled up" into an enterprise scorecard. The current method for producing the BSC is a time-consuming, manual quarterly process. This labor intensive method involves too much work from EDA's limited resources, leaves openings for entry errors, and does not provide the necessary involvement from both HQ and Regional Office staff. It also does not provide the analytic capabilities desired by senior staff.</p>
<p>The objective of this purchase request is to procure a COTS software tool that automates EDA's BSC implementation. In addition, the tool must be capable of working within the EDA Oracle environment; interfacing with other EDA databases and software; meeting Federal, DOC and EDA IT security requirements; providing the features required in the areas of functional requirements, technical requirements, and operational requirements; mitigating known risks; and satisfying the evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>The vendor must be able to provide onsite training and ongoing product support through an annual maintenance agreement. The vendor must be able to demonstrate past performance of their COTS tool to implement a similar BSC, and the vendor must have a business strategy that shows concrete benefits for EDA.</p>
<p>Responses must reference the sources sought to Sources Sought Number DG1325-08-SS0397(GJB) and include the following: (1) Name and Address of the Organization, (2) The size standard and small business program (8a, Service Disabled Veteran, HubZone, etc. including any teaming partners) status of the company as seen at listed under www.ccr.gov, (3) Point of contact with name, title, phone, fax and email, (4) DUNS number, (5) Contractors existing literature on services provided, experience, and general capabilities (i.e. pamphlets, brochures, etc.) no longer than 10 pages in length (6) List of three references to whom similar types of services have been previously provided to include contract number, dollar value, name and phone number of customer-must be relevant to the requirement and be within the last three years. The references must also include a description of the services rendered. (7) Contractor shall state if services can be solicited from a GSA schedule along with rates.</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. RESPONDENT WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEWS. ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT MUST BE RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE. THE CLOSING DATE FOR RESPONSES IS June 6, 2008 at 1PM EST. Emailed responses are authorized, but it is up to the vendor to make certain that the email was received. All questions must be submitted in writing and may be emailed to G. Jean Barrett at <a href="mailto:Jean.Barrett@NOAA.GOV">Jean.Barrett@NOAA.GOV</a>. Mailed documents can be sent to the address listed in Fedbizopps.</p>

NAVAIR has scheduled an Industry Day for 12 February 2008 from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm at the Frank Knox Building, VIP Room, Patuxent River, Maryland.  The Frank Knox Building is located just outside gate 2 with the entrance south of gate 2.  Access to the base is not required. This Industry Day is open to all interested parties. The intent of this Enterprise Architecture (EA) Center of Excellence (COE) Industry Day is to provide our Industry partners with an opportunity to learn more about the Navy?s focus on information delivery in a network-enabled environment and the direction NAVAIR is taking towards the development of architectural artifacts.   While careful and strategic planning goes into the design, an enterprise architecture actually emerges as a result of implementing individual projects; therefore, it is critical that NAVAIR programs develop their DoDAF views and ISPs using a defined set of recognized tools and templates.  This will ensure interoperability with other programs and demonstrate how these architectural artifacts decompose from overarching architectures.  The COE exemplifies the new collaborative business model ? multi-agency shared services delivery models.  Learn more about the EA COE vision and the perceived way forward in architecture development for NAVAIR.

The capability statement package shall be sent by mail to the following address:  Department of the Navy, Contracts Department, Code 251521, Building 441, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, 21893 Bundy Road, Unit 7, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1463; or via email linda.p.nelson@navy.mil; or by facsimile to (301) 757-6516.  Submissions must be received at the office and cited no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EDT) on 28 February 2008.  Questions or comments regarding this notice may be addressed electronically to Linda Nelson at linda.p.nelson@navy.mil.  No phone calls will be accepted or returned.

NAS Patuxent Rivers groundwater usage averaged 800,000 gallons per day (GPD). The State of Maryland Department of Natural Resources Water Resources Administration has issued Water Appropriation and Use Permits, which allow NAS Patuxent River to appropriate and use groundwater. 
NAS Patuxent Rivers potable water distribution systems, Systems A, B, C, and Q, consist of approximately 45.4 miles of distribution piping up to 12 inches in diameter.  Pipe materials include ductile iron pipe and cast iron pipe. The systems are combined potable and fire protection systems. Distribution system pressures average between 52 and 62 psi.  The water distribution system was originally installed in the 1940s.  WASTEWATER COLLECTION, TREATMENT, AND DISPOSAL SYSTEM:  The wastewater collection system at NAS Patuxent River consists of approximately 33 miles of gravity lines, 7 miles of force mains, 18 pump stations and 17 grinder/ejector stations.  The original collection system was installed in the 1940s.  The gravity system pipe materials include Vitrified Clay Pipe, Polyvinyl Chloride pipe, Asbestos Cement Pipe, Cast Iron pipe, Concrete Pipe, and Ductile Iron pipe.  The gravity mains vary in size up to 24-inches in diameter.    The force main system pipe materials include CI, VCP, AC, unknown material and PVC pipe.  The force mains vary in size from 4-inches to 14-inches in diameter.
The NAS Patuxent River domestic wastewater is discharged to the St. Marys County Metropolitan Commission (METCOM), Marley Taylor Water Reclamation Facility for treatment and final disposal.  Wastewater is metered at prior to discharge to METCOM.  The daily flow discharged to METCOM is approximately 800,000 GPD.  The wastewater interconnection between NAS Patuxent River and METCOM is an 18-inch diameter concrete pipe downstream from Pump Station 1389, off of East Patrol Road.  
WEBSTER FIELD: Webster Field is an annex of the NAS Patuxent River complex. It is located in St. Marys County, Maryland. Its borders consist primarily of the St. Marys River, about three miles upstream of the Potomac River, and Route 5.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this &ldquo;sources sought&rdquo; is to identify hotels willing to provide meeting space, lodging, and meals in the San Antonio, TX area, in light of new guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs. Two of the new requirements prescribe limits for meals and refreshments served at breaks. Regarding meals, the new guideline states that the cost of any meal provided, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 150 percent of the locality M&amp;IE per meal. For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $54.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $10.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $15.00 ($10.00 X 150%) per person. If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $54.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $15.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $22.50 ($15.00 X 150%) per person. The new guideline defines refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins. Under the new guidelines the cost of these items, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality (M&amp;IE) for both morning and afternoon breaks. For the San Antonio, TX area, the M&amp;IE rate is $54.00 per person. Therefore, the cost of the refreshments cannot exceed $12.42 ($54.00 X 23%) per person per day. Any hotel source interested and capable of providing lodging at the Federal per diem rates and meeting the new guideline requirements should submit a statement of capabilities, to include sleeping and meeting capacity, floor charts, and food and beverage menus, to the point of contact identified. The food and beverage menus should support the pricing mentioned above, including hotel service costs: breakfast, $15.00 per person; lunch, $22.50 per person; and refreshments for both morning and afternoon breaks, $12.42 per person.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Department of Homeland Security is conducting market research.

The Department of Homeland Security has a possible future requirement for advertising, public relations, social marketing and partnership development for a public service advertisement (PSA) campaign.  

The contractor will be responsible for distributing existing PSAs until they expire in the general market, Hispanic market, and business market which include television, print, radio, internet, and outdoor advertisements.  Therefore, the contractor must be able to demonstrate relationships with media organizations and public service directors as well as their established distribution channels nationwide in donated media space.  This would also require assuming all the current talent obligations and meeting the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists regulations and ability to do this must be demonstrated.

Once these PSAs expire, the contractor will be responsible for the creation of new PSAs on a cycle basis of 2 years for television, print, radio, internet, and outdoor advertisements.  A requirement of the contractor will be to utilize the expertise of top industry leaders in advertising, media, and communications fields in the development of these PSAs on a voluntary basis.  Again, all talent obligations will need to meet the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists regulations.  

In addition, one of the services the campaign provides its local and state partners is the opportunity to localize the campaign in their state or city.  Therefore, the contractor must have the ability and capacity to work with these states and cities in not only tailoring the PSAs but also have the ability to help them secure media donations for this localized work.  This is a requirement that will need to be demonstrated in the capability statement.

The contractor will be responsible for conducting annual tracking surveys of Americans attitudes and behaviors on emergency preparedness and the Campaigns progress.  Therefore, it is important for the contractor to have experience in emergency preparedness issues and have an expertise in conducting research.  

As a public service advertisement campaign, the Department also requires a contractor who can distribute the campaign messages through media outreach and significant public relations effort.  This includes but not limited to preparing media materials, promoting the campaign through satellite television, radio media tours, press conferences, and other activities.  The contractor will be responsible for tracking these media efforts.

Another responsibility and requirement of the contractor will be to assist the department in organizing and sponsoring the campaigns largest organized effort that is a month long activity.  This requires creation of marketing materials to communities nationwide to assist in their efforts in promoting emergency preparedness.

Lastly, the campaign relies heavily on partnerships.  Therefore, the contractor will be responsible for developing relationships with a wide variety of public and private sector as well as media and non-media organizations to distribute the campaigns message.  It is a requirement for the contractor to demonstrate experience in assisting in partnership development.

Firms should submit a detailed capability statement that addresses this sources sought synopsis and specifically the following areas:

	The contractor must be able to demonstrate relationships with media organizations and public service directors as well as their established distribution channels nationwide in donated media space.

	The ability to assume all current talent obligations and meet the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federal of Television and Radio Artists regulations.

Payment to Honeywell is based on the energy savings realized during the course of the contract. These payments cover the cost of the and also include anticipated maintenance cost. Funds for contract payments are taken from Kirtland's utility budget. If these savings are not realized, the government may reduce the payment to Honeywell by an amount not to exceed the savings shortfall. In addition to the energy savings Honeywell is also responsible for maintaining the buildings at a certain temperature. To ensure the savings are realized and that the temperatures are maintained in accordance with the contract it is imperative that the HVAC equipment be continually maintained for optimum performance. The Air Force's ongoing construction and modernization program for the aging facilities on the base have affected the HVAC equipment in ESPC facilities that Honeywell is responsible for. Although these changes are allowed under the basic ESPC contract, paragraph C.13, the ESPC contract does not allow for funds to be added to cover the maintenance cost of any new equipment installed by these projects. Maintenance and repair service shall consist of the following requirements: The existing single point of service, the Civil Engineering service call desk, shall be the initiation point for all service calls. Contractor shall use the government work tracking computer system (currently Response time must match the ESPC contract. At a minimum, telephone response to a service call shall be within 1 hour, and arrival on site shall be within 24 hours, or 4 hours for emergency repairs (defined as work needed to prevent damage to government facilities or equipment, work needed to prevent injury to personnel, or work needed to prevent adversely affecting the government's mission). For some facilities, the emergency repair response time is 1 hour and the repair time is not to exceed 8 hours (if 8 hours is exceeded, provision for temporary heating/cooling must be made) Contractor must be able to work Honeywell excel 5000 direct digital control/energy management and control system (DDC/EMCS) equipment. All programming is done by Honeywell, and Honeywell is responsible for EMCS monitoring. Contractor must work with Honeywell for remote EMCS access. Equipment must be maintained at new efficiency levels so that the savings for the ESPC contract is not lost. All maintenance and repairs shall be performed to manufacturer's requirements and shall maintain full operability of the system controls will not be manually overridden). The following are the government's concerns if this contract is not awarded to Honeywell. Any statements of capability must address these: Having an additional civil engineering service contractor operating at AFB will increase costs for the other contracts by requiring multiple contractors to respond to service calls, and requiring the customer service desk do more evaluation to who to dispatch. The government will not provide space on base for an additional contractor, and given current security requirements resulting in frequent access delays at the gates, a one-hour response time may not be attainable.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement. Responses are due by and shall be submitted to 377 Contracting Squadron ,2000 Wyoming SE, Kirtland AFB 87117-5606. If you have any questions, please call Mr. Denis C. McGrew, 505-846-5703, Contract Specialist, or Ms. Susan J. McDaniel, 505-846-5680, Contracting Officer.</p>

<CONTACT>SN08-37 SN08-37, Coordinator, Email BAA08-21@darpa.mil
<DESC>PROPOSERS DAY CONFERENCE
DARPA will host a Proposers Day Workshop for the Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE) program (BAA08-21) on 13 June 2008 at the Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201, 8:30AM  4:00PM. The purpose of this Conference is to provide information on the MAINGATE effort, promote additional discussion on this topic, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION  
The objective of the MAINGATE program is to develop the next generation Network Centric Radio System (NCRS) with additional capabilities and an assured affordable unit price to the user.  DARPA envisions two critical technologies for achieving these new goals:  1.) a backbone radio architecture that enables a versatile IP network and 2.) a radio gateway that enables legacy analog and digital communications systems to be internetworked.  As with NCRS, the MAINGATE will enable heterogeneous groups of radios to be integrated into a heterogeneous network tolerant to high latency and packet loss.  The technologies developed for the program will permit affordable, tactical, real-time, high fidelity video, data, and voice services to be deployed in a networked environment to support tactical operations in either maneuver or dismounted operations.  As a result of this effort, DARPA expects a clear demonstration of advanced mobile ad hoc network (MANET) gateway technology that will incorporate a Wireless IP-capable Network (WIPN), which provides interconnectivity between nodes bridging heterogeneous mixtures of radio networks.  A unique characteristic of the MAINGATE program is the integration of a default IP radio network as part of the gateway.  The program will be designed around a test-build-test philosophy through intermediate and final field evaluations, which will lead to Limited User Testing (LUT) by US and Allied Experimental Forces evaluating the effect of MAINGATE on new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) designed for the networked maneuver and dismounted forces.

MAINGATE will be a connection point that allows a multitude of users employing a heterogeneous set of radio technologies (both proprietary and non-proprietary) on different stub-nets to attach to and communicate through an IP Network.  The WIPN will provide the default high bandwidth connectivity among air and ground mobility platforms.  The network will include the integration of adaptive communications architecture, flexible routing architecture, and heterogeneous application services.  It is envisioned that a large fraction of the IP networking technology will be commercial or based upon commercial systems.  Only components and subsystems at an approximate maturity of Technical Readiness Level (TRL)-6 will be considered for entry into this effort.

Proposals to MAINGATE must address DoD specific and coalition radios and networks; commercial radios and networks; and relevant applications for seamless integration, as well as the capacity to attach to other IP networks (e.g. SATCOM) to provide both redundant and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) networking.  The output of this program will be a demonstrated suite of hardware and software components that can be configured for specific DoD, coalition, and first responders/public safety requirements. 

Details regarding the MAINGATE program will be presented at the Proposers Day meeting.

<DESC>This is a market research to determine if there exists enough small businesses in the State of Colorado to set aside an IDIQ contract. Services would be for the Rocky Mountain Region's 7 forests in the State of Colorado.  The intent is to award approximately three (may be less, may be more) IDIQ contracts for services listed below who must have offices in the State of Colorado.

These draft documents are NOT to be considered as a Request of Proposal or Quotation or any solicitation at all.  

More market research notices may be posted.  Please watch out for them.

Potential vendors are invited, at their expense, to participate in a capability briefing for about 1 hour to the R2 forestry personnel, concerning their capabilities in providing services as noted below.   Those interested need to contact Mr. Stephen Moore, 970-945-3208.  He will schedule dates/times slots for vendors during the week from June 16 to June 20, 2008.  This briefing is not mandatory.

<DESC>The Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to enter into a no cost contract with SureScripts, LLC, for access to the Pharmacy Health Information Exchange.  Under the proposed agreement, electronic prescription messages sent from the IHS Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) to pharmacies that contract directly or indirectly with SureScripts may only be transmitted through the Pharmacy Health Information Exchange.  IHS will retain the right to use non-electronic prescription methods and may enter into contracts or agreements with other similar exchange network providers subject to the limitations described herein and the necessary testing and validation.  IHS developed e-prescribing capability for RPMS as part of its project to achieve certification of RPMS by the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology (CCHIT).  CCHIT certification of RPMS is a mandated activity for IHS.  Electronic prescribing is an identified business need for Indian Health Service and Tribally-operated health care facilities that are the principal users of RPMS.  The ability to transmit electronic prescriptions to retail pharmacies in virtually every state requires access to the Pharmacy Health Information Exchange operated by SureScripts. This is an information notice only and is not a request for proposals.  Comments or inquiries must be received by the response date to be considered prior to award.

<CONTACT>Darlene Rideout, (508) 233-4125

<a href="mailto:Darlene.Rideout@natick.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Natick Soldier Systems Center, Natick, MA (NSRDEC) is entertaining white papers from firms or teams of firms having the requisite Soldier protection, human factors and evaluation expertise to develop a survivability-fightability personal armor assessment tool. The intent of the tool is to enable users, such as a Product Manager or Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements developer, in advance of a large armor development effort or purchase to determine how a complete armor system may perform in the areas that are most desirable for given mission type and threat combinations (e.g., a mounted patrol facing an IED threat would employee an up armor configuration, while a dismounted patrol through mountains facing the threat of small arms fire would don the base armor configuration). NSRDEC anticipates this to be a multi-phase project that may extend until the end of FY10 and may require up to eight man-years of effort over the next two years. Phase I of the effort involves defining the key survivability and fightability performance attributes (e.g., area of coverage, load carriage capacity, Soldier mobility, thermal burden, weapons interface/firing position and accuracy, system bulk, modularity). Phase II of the effort involves developing attribute-driven, scientifically-based test standards that can be applied to various armor system types and yield repeatable output. The third and final phase of the effort involves a means of summarizing the survivability-fightability results in an easy to interpret manner.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that each phase of the effort will be a contract option, as will the development of each test standard.  The government may decide to award separate contracts or use other government agencies for the development of individual test standards.  Interested parties are invited to submit a white paper under Topic 13 of the Natick Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Solicitation Number 07 - 09 Natick BAA effective from 1 April 2007 - 31 March 2009.  To obtain a copy of the BAA, contact Darlene L. Rideout at darlene.rideout@us.army.mil.  White papers should be sent via email to Kristine Isherwood (email: kristine.isherwood1@us.army.mil, phone 508-233-4924, fax 508-233-4483) by 17 June 2008. Prior to white paper submittal, there will be a pre-proposal conference for all interested parties on Monday, 9 June 2008 at 1:00 PM at NSREDC to present the topic and answer questions.  Individuals planning to attend this conference must submit name, address, citizenship, company, address, phone number to Alysia Dzedulonus (email:  Alysia.dzedulonus@us.army.mil, 508-233-5914) by noon EDT 5 June 2008.   Conference will be held at Natick, conference room will be provided when signing up.  The Government shall evaluate all white papers and provide a written response/proposal invitations to the offerors on or about 7 July 2008. It is anticipated that proposals will be due 30 July 2008. NSRDEC expects to award contract(s) by the end of FY08.<BR><BR>Access to Secret or NATO sensitive information is expected for some portions of this contract effort, and companies should have or have the ability to obtain a Secret clearance and storage facility, as outlined in the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) and its supplements, in order to participate in this contract. <BR>

1.2 On August 13, 2007, a human-caused fire burned approximately 4,708 acres of critical shrub-steppe and grassland habitats within the Arid Lands Ecology Reserve of the Hanford Reach National Monument.  This area is comprised primarily of highly-erodible soils and early-seral native vegetation, and prior to the fire had a low frequency/cover percentage of invasive plants, the worst of these being Rush skeletonweed.  Among other things the fire destabilized the ecological integrity of the area making it highly susceptible to invasion by weed species.  Chemical control is required as an emergency stabilization treatment as part of an integrated approach to address the invasive species presence within the burned area.
2.  DEFINITIONS:  2.1 ALE:  Fitzner-Eberhardt Arid Lands Ecology Reserve resource management unit of the Hanford Reach National Monument
2.2 GIS:  Geographic Information System
2.3 GPS:  Global Positioning System
2.4 Hanford:  U.S. Department of Energy, Hanford Site

3.  SCOPE:  3.1 The contractor will aerially apply Milestone (aminopyralid; EPA Reg. No. 62719-519) and appropriate adjuvants on approximately 810 acres of the Milepost 17 Fire areas using helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft.  Milestone will be applied to areas within the fire area that have been pre-defined and mapped within a GIS by USFWS.  The contractor will apply Milestone at a rate of 6 oz/acre and adjuvants at appropriate label-identified rates (including, but not limited to, non-ionic surfactant, anti-foaming/de-foaming agents, and drift control agents), in ?5 gallons of water per acre.
3.2 The contractor will purchase and supply all chemicals, including herbicides and adjuvants.  Contractor will also supply equipment to meter chemicals and water mixtures, and will provide mixing and loading equipment and water.  Water hauling services may be required depending upon airport arrangements secured by contractor (see Clauses 3.5 and 7.1 below).  Equipment and personnel must be able to work at a semi-remote and primitive site (i.e., no electrical or water hookups, no hanger or aircraft tie-down facilities, nearest services are >20 miles away, etc.).
3.3 The contractor must be capable of calibrating aircraft to the final application rate specifications. All spraying equipment and/or aircraft must be equipped with GPS tracking equipment that can map application areas and flight paths and can download information for contractor and USFWS use.  GPS equipment must be capable of uploading a GIS shapefile of treatment areas and of providing downloadable maps and information of treatment progress on a daily basis.  All application locations and flight paths will be documented by the contractor using GPS.
3.4 The contractor shall provide adequate personnel for the purpose of loading and dispersing of the chemicals.  All personnel and equipment to be used shall be appropriately licensed and certificated as appropriate for the work to be done.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing sufficient equipment, equipment fuel, safety items, spill response kit, personnel and their subsistence needs during the project period, as well as for checking all work sites for hazards of any type which could impact their ability to accomplish the spraying project.   
 3.5 The contractor will be required to make all necessary arrangements for use of airport run-ways, loading zones, and equipment and fuel storage areas.  The contractor will be responsible for all loading operations.  Movement of chemicals, water, and equipment in and around an operation location will be the sole responsibility of the applicators.  This may require special handling equipment including, but not limited to, a forklift, water truck, or pallet jack.
3.6 If Road 106 is used as a landing site (see Clause 7.1 below) the contractor shall provide adequate personnel and/or signage to regulate traffic on this road.  Access to Road 106 is restricted to authorized personnel only, but access must be maintained for these authorized personnel.
3.7 The contractor must be licensed and bonded.  Proof of bonding will be required upon notification of bid award.  The contractor is required to obtain a performance bond of 25% of the total bid price and a payment bond of 20% of the total bid price.  Submission of bonding will be required prior to any work commencing.
3.8 The contractor shall be responsible for conducting all flight-following.  Communications must be maintained between ground personnel and the aircraft at all times.  Additionally aircraft and ground personnel must have appropriate communication capability to communicate with Hanford dispatch and/or USFWS personnel.  
3.9 The contractor shall provide USFWS with contact information for all ground personnel, and vehicle and equipment identification information (including make, model, and license and/or identification numbers) at least 24 hours before implementation of the project.
3.10 No chemical applications may be made during inversions, when winds exceed 8 mph sustained, when temperatures exceed 85 F, or when precipitation is forecast within 6 hours.  Minimum buffers must be maintained near Highway 240 to prevent spray drift onto traffic and undesired areas.
4.  PLACE/DELIVERY AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  4.1 GIS-designated areas within the Milepost 17 fire burn area, ALE, Hanford Reach National Monument, Benton County, WA.
4.2 The project should begin on or about June 20, 2008, and be completed before July 12, 2008, and will likely take one to two days to complete.  It is critical that all aerial operations be completed during this short window of opportunity.
5.  INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE:  5.1 The contractor will supply GPS files of all flight paths and of all application locations.  The contractor will also supply shapefiles in ESRI format of all flight paths and of all application locations.
5.2 Evaluation and acceptance will be determined by the Technical Coordinator(s) and/or Refuge Manager(s).  Chemical applications will be evaluated for thoroughness and evenness of application using GPS files and shapefiles provided by the contractor, and by field-checking application areas for chemical effects (e.g., looking for skips or overlaps in the effects on the vegetation).
6.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT OR MATERIALS/INFORMATION:  6.1 Maps and GIS shapefiles of the treatment areas.
6.2 Monitoring of and communication of the application site readiness to the contractor on a weekly basis in a pre-arranged conference call beginning on or about June 1, 2008.
6.3 Coordination and communication with Hanford security regarding security and air restriction considerations as needed.
6.4 Verification of spray application by spot check and review of aircraft GPS mapping of chemical application areas.
7.  AVAILABILITY:  7.1 The application area is approximately 12 to 16 air miles north of the Richland, Washington airport (located at 46 18' 30" Latitude North , 119 18' 0"  Longitude West, at 393 feet above MSL elevation).  Road 106, a 2 lane paved road within the ALE restricted access area, may be available as an alternate landing site.  This road is within 4 air miles of the treatment site.  Contact USFWS for details.  It is the contractor's responsibility to assure they have acquired appropriate permission of landowners of privately-owned areas or other entities for use of non-public airfields or strips.  Specific treatment maps will be provided to the successful bidder by the USFWS.
7.2 The Milepost 17 Fire is immediately adjacent to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.  Due to national security issues, airspace and access restrictions may be in effect at the time of contract implementation.  These restrictions may include elevational flight limitations from the airport loading areas to the project sites and may require daily coordination between the USFWS, contractor, and Hanford Security officials.  If operations occur on DOE-owned lands, the USFWS will assist the contractor in obtaining proper clearances and provide updated security information as needed.
7.3 It is common to have high-wind events, inversions, and high temperatures during the project time period.  This may lead to implementation and application delays.  
7.4 Annual precipitation on the Monument is approximately 6 inches, with most coming in the form of winter fogs and rains and summer thundershowers.  Elevation within the treatment area is approximately 540 feet above Mean Sea Level (MSL).
7.5 There are electrical utility lines running near the north and the south ends of the treatment area. The east boundary of the treatment area abuts Highway 240.  All of these present application challenges that the contractor will have to be mindful of and will have to handle appropriately.

<DESC>Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a firm fixed price purchase order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. No other solicitation will be issued. The North American Industry Classification Code is 561492. It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. 

STATEMENT OF WORK: 

Verbatim Transcription and Official Summary Working Minutes Services.
	
Nineteen meetings are projected in the base year, however, the Government reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of meetings per year. Meetings will average fifty participants whose comments will need to be captured verbatim with each speaker identified.
Meetings are highly scientific and technical in nature, they usually last one day, but at times last 2 days, from 8am to 6pm. Court reporters are required to stay until the meeting ends. 
Also, because of the wide variety of both the subject matter focus of each advisory committees and also the fact that each Committee Executive Secretary is a different person, an extensive amount of time must be allocated by the bidder to become familiar with both the content of each scientific area as well as the special needs and preferences for each committee with regard to how the summary minutes are presented. This requirement for interactive involvement between the court reporter/writer and the Committee Executive Secretary is continuous and ongoing not only because from time to time the person holding the position of Committee Executive Secretary may change which implies a change in the "working" summary preference requirements, but also because the content of the material discussed changes due to new discoveries in scientific research.
Transcribers must arrive one hour prior to the start of the meeting.
Deliverables: 
              1.Transcripts:
a. Hard Copies; 
b. 1 original + 1 copy; 
 c.CD Roms; 
 d.  1 word formatted  full transcript on 1 cd rom; 
1 pdf format with only 100 pages on each cd rom  please label cds accordingly (i.e., 1 of 3 Circulatory Meeting 9/19/07)
 e. Closed Session:
                        2 Hard Copies (no CDs) 
                    2. 1 audio of open and closed session  labeled accordingly with the word audio
        3. Summary Minutes:
       Summary Minutes of the entire meeting, one document for each day, not to exceed 25 pages per day. Include CD Rom in WORD format.

 

Delivery:

 Eight (8) business days after the meeting, verbatim text of proceedings are to be sent electronically to the attention of the Project Officer .

Final product must be received within five (5) business days. The transcripts must be delivered to: Project Officer
Telephone Numbers: 
TBD

Prior Notice requirements: 

In general, advisory committee staff endeavors to give all possible practical prior notice of one-day and two-day meetings which may be as much be 1 or 2 or 3 weeks previous to schedule dates, however because of circumstances beyond the control of staff such as weather or other mitigating conditions, bidder must be willing to accept as little as 1 or 2 days prior notice and be ready with all trained and skilled personnel to perform all services required and to be present for entire duration of proceedings. 

Contractor must be approved by FDA for access to privileged information and must be certified as being capable to receive and protect such information according to the requirements set forth in 21 CFR 20.90 (Disclosure to Contractor).
Price includes any additional staff hours and pages if meeting goes beyond tentative times listed.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missiel Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Raytheon Company, Andover MA for an increase to the ceiling on the current Raytheon Contract W9113M-08-C-0153. The purposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Requlation (FAR) 6.302-1. This action is to provide BETSS-C engineering, programmatic, logtistics, mission sustainment, system support activities and analysis to include all phases of Integrated Support Planning, coordination, control, scheduling and monitoring of assets. Award to any source other than Raytheon would result in unacceptable delays and substantial cost. This action will be a modification to the existing cost plus fixed fee contract. The ceiling increase will support the execution of work planned through 1 May 09. The significant duplication of cost involved with a new contractor is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed toward Raytheon Company. This acquistion is not open to foreign firms. All responses should be directed to Elbert Clarke at elbert.clarke@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from publication of this synopsis. No telephone inquires will be accepted. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services the government intends to negotiate with only one source  under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract W9113M-08-C-0153, and is not a request for competitive proposals. This synopsis is being issued for information purposes only. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available. See numbered notes 22.

The VA OIG is requesting prices for both date ranges provided in the solicitation.  The lodging rates must be within the Government Per Diem rate or lower for the area.

Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote.This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a writtenamendment will not be issued.The purpose of this amendment is to answer additional questions regarding therequirement.Question # 1:What is the actual lowest temperature needed to reach for this application?  Is itactually -70 Degrees C or another value such as -50 Degrees C? Answer # 1:The no-load temperature should be -70C or less and the unit should be capable of lifting250W load at -70C.  This includes all loads external to the chiller (parasitic loads aswell as dissipation in the object being cooled).Question # 2: How has the Pump Capacity, 4.0GPM at 30 PSI and 2.0GPM at 60 PSI, been determined? Thiscapacity is extremely high and not feasible with most products in this class.  Perhaps there are factors that we could account for that would allow us to revisit thatspecification requirement. We would be happy to assist with calculating thosespecifications. Answer # 2:This is a minimum capacity that is believed to be sufficient based on lab testing withthe chiller being replaced.  Question # 3: What is the delivery time-frame required by NASA for this unit?Answer # 3:1 monthThe due date for receipt of offers is not extended.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on June 6, 2008.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

4 March 2008
Urgent Information concerning the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program (ATEP)follows:   Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) is not recognizing ATEP'ssolicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2560. Consequently, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS post toATEP did not post on FBO under said solicitation number. After numerous attemptsby PIXS and FBO administrators to resolve the issue, both concluded the onlysolution is to reissue ATEP information under a new solicitation number.Therefore to ensure you receive any and all updates to the ATEP, you must register/re-register under the new solicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2599. The name of theprogram has not changed, it is still the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program(ATEP).

Additionally, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS posting issuing a new sources sought synopsis isalso attached.   That posting issued a suspense date of 1500 local, 14 Mar 08 forsubmittal of capability statements.  Due to the posting difficulties, a new suspense date of 1500 local, 18 Mar 08 is established. There are no other changes to the requirements for submittals.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;************ PLEASE NOTE: This is a modification to Space Warfare Center (SWC) Open Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 04-01, clarifying SWC BAA 04-06.</p>
<p>Modification Description:</p>
<p>Modification 13 to SWC BAA 04-01 adds verbiage to SWC BAA 04-6 clarifying the requirements for security markings. The additional language can be found in the attachment titled&nbsp; "BAA revision for security markings".</p>
<p>Paragraph IE1 supercedes the same numbered paragraph under Modification 12.</p>
<p>SWC BAA 04-06 Description (IAW FAR 35.016 and its supplements):</p>
<p>SWC BAA 04-06 makes minor changes to existing focus areas under Tactical Enhancement Capabilities (TENCAP) and the Fusion Center. This call also changes submission instructions, separating instructions for unclassified and classified documents. Other clerical changes have also been made as a result of this modification. Calls will be executed on an annual basis. White papers for SWC BAA 04-06 may be submitted from the date of this announcement through 18 Feb 09. All terms and conditions of the previous announcement for SWC BAA 04-05 remain valid. A complete description of SWC BAA 04-06 is identified in the attached document. The SWC may contract for activities covered in the focus areas detailed within this document. The intent of the BAA is to investigate and develop concepts and technologies that will enable the Space Innovation Development Center (SIDC) to meet current and future Air Force warfighter space needs. The goal is to develop technologies that provide the best possible space capabilities for the warfighters, when and where needed, in the most cost-effective manner. White papers and subsequent proposals can cover either development of new capabilities for potential 3600 Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) acquisitions or leverage off of existing capabilities for 3400 Operation &amp; Maintenenace (O&amp;M) acquisitions. Please closely follow the directions in the BAA regarding submission of white papers and do not submit a formal proposal at this time.&nbsp;It was determined that specific funds would not be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. However, should potential white papers be accepted from those institutions, and adequate funding become available, proposals will be requested from them. Direct questions to Mr. Robert Wind at (719) 567-3565 (robert.wind@schriever.af.mil).</p>

<DESC><p>SYNOPSIS<br />13 May 2008
<p><br />The 62d Contracting Squadron at McChord AFS is soliciting for a indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity construction contract (IDIQ). This acquisition is for a requirement contract for a one year base period plus two, one year option periods.</p>
<p>The work consists of all plant, labor, equipment and materials for the execution of interior painting of various Military Family Housing (MFH) units for Project No. 07-4009A/B/C entitled IDC Paint Interior MFH at McChord AFB, Washington.</p>
<p>JOINT BASE LEWIS / MCCHORD: McChord Air Force Base and Fort Lewis are in the process of combining various functions and requirements as a result of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Joint Basing guidelines. This contract may add the requirements of Fort Lewis to this McChord contract at a subsequent time or in a subsequent option year, or the requirements of this contract may be added to a Fort Lewis contract at a subsequent time in which case an option to this contract may possibly not be exercised. Any additional requirements may increase quantity of work or the number of positions. Any additional requirements may not necessarily change the scope as to task performed.</p>

The work to be preformed under this IDIQ acquisition will be within the North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) 238320 - Paint and Wall Covering Contractor.</p>
<p>The exact closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation including specifications and drawings, will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website at hhtp://www.fedbizopps.gov. Hard copies will not be available. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package, which will be on or about <strong>16 June 08</strong> and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and drawings.

Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractors Registration at web site http://www.ccr.gov/ and ORCA at web site http://orca.bpn.gov/.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation cost.</p>
<p>Please Note: Past Performance documentation addressed in Section L of the solicitation will be required not later than five calendar days prior to the closing of the proposal.</p>

<DESC>The following Contractor Questions were received by the DDC Contracting Office in response to the solicitation:

We have a few technical questions regarding BLDG 79:
 
1. The specs mention asbestosis in the surrounding area is asbestosis in material that needs to be removed?
2. Is the piping to the chiller above grade or below grade?

The following responses are provided to these Contractor Questions:

1. The contractor does not mention the Specification Section where the removal of asbestos is stated.  I think that he is making reference to Specification Section 01011-SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS, paragraph 14.4.  This Section is included in every project sent to the Contracting Office. The paragraph is advising the contractor that friable and/or nonfriable
asbestos-containing material may be encountered in area(s) where the contract work is to be performed so that he can take the necessary precautions if asbestos-containing material is encountered. The asbestos-containing material in this project is unknown.

2.  The piping to the chiller is above grade.

The Closing Date for receipt of quotes is extended to the close of business on 04 June 2008.

QUESTION12:  [Several potential offerors have asked questions about the materials specifications and the label marking process. Rather than answering individual questions, the following information is provided.] <br><br>

ANSWER 12: <br> 
<br>
The Government is looking for the best IUID Data Label solution.  The solution, presented in the proposal, should include flexibility to order a wide variety of material, imprint, and adhesive options.  To clarify the Governments intent, see the first item under the title ADDITIONAL SOLICITATION CHANGES, below.  The following material examples are provided in the solicitation.  These materials are the ones that shall be used by the offeror when completing the representative Schedule of Items/Services and Prices, (Attachment 1) that is being used as the pricing example forproposal evaluation purposes, only. <br><br>
  
Solicitation Section C, Paragraph 7.1.1.1 as currently written is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following --<br><br>

NOTE:  The material thickness variations stated on each worksheet in Attachment 1 are to be used in place of thickness variations stated in Section C.  Offerors should propose the closest commercially available products. <br><br><br>

QUESTION13:  Request clarification on the requirement for vinyl labels.  Does this type label include destructible labels, i.e., labels that are destroyed when removed from the item? <br><br>

ANSWER 13:  Destructible tags that offer tamper detection characteristics are not a primary requirement for this effort but may be included as a proposed material option (see answer to question 12, above). <br><br><br>


QUESTION14:  Can the AIT PMO provide a standard label quantity level for evaluation purposes? <br><br>

ANSWER 14:  To ensure that pricing from different offerors is placed on equal footing, solicitation Sections L, M and Attachment 1 have been amended.  Attachment 1 has been amended to include specific quantities, for proposal purposes only.  Attachment 1 has been revised to include pricing for each different size and for each of the three delivery times, as well as for material type, material thickness, marking process, and attachment method.  See amended Attachment 1, attached.  Solicitation Section L, Paragraph L.3.8. is deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following.  Changes are made throughout. <br><br>

L.3.8  Price - State the fixed unit prices and total price for a quantity of one, each, offered for IUID Data Labels. <br>
a.	Fixed unit prices offered for IUID Data Labels will include: (1) the price of data labels, (2) the price of the processing and management service, (3) the price of the phone support, and (4) the price of all supporting and/or overhead costs associated with this product and its delivery (excluding actual direct shipping charges).  <br>
b.	A quantity of one, for each of the selected Contract Line Item Number (CLIN), shall be used as the basis for proposal price comparison.  The total price offered will be the total amount when all unit-of-one prices are summed.  This total price amount will be used for evaluation purposes only.  The actual schedule of items and prices will be established based on the options offered in the best value solution.  The contract ceiling will be set by the Government at time of award to accurately represent the total price for purchasing all data labels. <br>
c.	The Government has provided a Schedule of Items / Services and Prices (see Attachment 1).  Offerors shall use this schedule for submitting their list of items and prices.  The configuration of this schedule represents the Governments conception of item pricing.  Phase increments have been used to allow for price changes over the life of the contract and are not fixed to any specific period of time although they generally represent one year. <br>
d.	The Government recognizes that the best value solution, selected for contract award, will likely incorporate item options and prices not included in the Governments schedule that is being used for proposal evaluation purposes.  Additionally, offerors may desire to use different schedule configurations to represent or capture their individual pricing structure, considering tier pricing or pricing variations.  Offerors may propose an alternate schedule configuration.  The proposed alternate configuration will be considered by the Government for use in the contract but prices in the alternate schedule configuration will not be considered during the evaluation or affect the outcome of the evaluation.  Only the total price, as defined above, will be used in the best value determination.  Note: Delivery orders placed against this contract will be based on the fixed unit prices offered. <br>
e.	State the estimated prices for shipping* based on the proposed shipping strategy.  For estimating purposes, 80% of the labels shall be shipped to locations within the continental United States and 20% shall be shipped overseas.  Shipping costs are included on a separate contract line item and will be reimbursed at actual cost.  These prices will be used for planning and budget purposes and to establish ceiling prices in the contract but will NOT be included in the price total when performing the best value determination during proposal evaluations.  <br><br>

*Note: The estimated price for shipping is the estimated amount that will be paid to a third party shipper or the estimated amount that the offeror will charge for self-shipping.  In either case, shipping costs must be broken out separately prior to reimbursement by the Government, and will be subject to validation in accordance with the cost reimbursement provisions of the contract.  If offerors propose self-shipping or to include indirect charges on direct shipping costs, the Government will require extensive validation and financial audits to insure that these indirect charges are not also included in the overheads charged on the fixed price portions of this contract.  This financial oversight will not be required if only third party shippers are used and only direct costs are billed for shipping. <br><br>

f.	Travel will be reimburse at actual cost up to the ceiling of $10,000 per contract phase increment.  These ceiling prices are included in the price schedule.  Travel prices will NOT be included in the price total when performing the best value determination during proposal evaluations. <br><br>

End of Section L change. <br><br>

Solicitation Paragraph M.4 is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following.  Changes are made to the last sentence of the first paragraph and the entire last paragraph.
<br><br>
M.4	Step 3 - Price/Rate<br><br>

IUID DATA LABEL AND IUID DATA LABEL MANAGEMENT AND PROCESSING SERVICES PRICES:  <br><br>

For evaluation purposes, the Government will use the total price offered for IUID Data Labels when making its best value determination.  The total price offered for IUID Data Labels will include: (1) the price of data labels, (2) the price of the processing and management service, (3) the price of the phone support, and (4) the price of all supporting and/or overhead costs associated with this product and its delivery.  The total price shall be based on the estimated quantities set forth in the Schedule of Items and Prices (solicitation Attachment 1).  <br><br>

For evaluation purposes, the Government will NOT use (1) the estimated price of shipping*, or (2) the estimated price of travel.  <br><br>

*Note: The estimated price for shipping is the estimated amount that will be paid to a third party shipper or the estimated amount that the offeror will charge for self-shipping.  In either case, shipping costs must be broken out separately prior to reimbursement by the Government, and will be subject to validation in accordance with the cost reimbursement provisions of the contract.  If offerors propose self-shipping or include indirect charges on direct shipping costs, the Government will require extensive validation and financial audits to insure that these indirect charges are not also included in the overheads charged on the fixed price portions of this contract.  This financial oversight will not be required if only third party shippers are used and only direct costs are billed for shipping.  In the latter case, the Government will only require copies of shipping invoices to verify reimbursement requests. <br><br>

The Government has provided a Schedule of Items / Services and Prices (see Attachment 1).  Offerors shall use this schedule for submitting their list of items and prices.  The configuration of this schedule represents the Governments conception of item pricing.  A quantity of one, for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN), shall be used as the basis for proposal price comparison.  The total price offered will be the total amount when all unit-of-one prices are summed.  Only this total price amount will be used when performing the best value determination.  This amount, used during the proposal evaluation, does not represent the contract ceiling. <br><br>

End of Section M change. <br><br><br>


QUESTION15:  What type of label(s) (i.e. template material, thickness, and attachment options) will the PMO require to be delivered within 24 hrs during Phase 1 and Phase 2?  <br><br>

ANSWER 15:  <br><br>

The Government does not have a definitive answer to this question, and the following does not represent a firm or implied Government requirement.  The Government believes that the .003" aluminum foil label (1.75"L x .75"H) with laser etching and adhesive backing AND the polyester label (1.75"L x .75"H) with thermal transfer and adhesive backing will be the two labels most in demand for the 24 hr delivery (in both Phase 1 and 2.) <br><br><br>

QUESTION16:  On page L3, (4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items.  Please confirm/clarify if proposals may offer some of the data label types but not required to offer all types. <br><br>

ANSWER 16:  The Government has taken exception to the standard language cited in the question.  The Governments requirement is stated in Paragraph L.3.14.  However, due to the need for clarification, Paragraph L.3.14 is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: <br><br>

L.3.14	Partial Proposal - Paragraph (c)(4) of FAR 52.215-1  Instructions to OfferorsCompetitive Acquisition, above, does not apply to this acquisition.  The Government is looking for the best solution; however, the proposed solution, as a minimum, must include the materials identified in Solicitation Section C, Paragraph 7.1.1.1  Materials.  Only proposals that offer these required items will be eligible for award. <br><br><br>


ADDITIONAL SOLICITATION CHANGES<br><br>

The following additional changes are made to the solicitation to clarify and stress what the Government is looking for in the proposal regarding an IUID Data Label solution and to add a provision to take advantage of Item Request Quantity Discounts. <br><br>

1.	The Government wishes to make it clear that it is looking for the best IUID Data Label solution.  This includes product options to meet a wide variety of labeling requirements.  Proposals should demonstrate the capability to produce labels that meet the requirement found in MIL-STD-130N, Para. 4.3., which states, identification labels used shall be as permanent as the normal life expectancy of the item and be capable of withstanding the environmental tests and cleaning procedures for the item to which it is affixed.  The solicitation is clarified as follows to convey the intent of the Government. <br><br>

Add the following change to Section L --<br><br>

Paragraph L.3.7.b - Vendor Product vs. Government Requirement-General is changed to add the following sentence --  The Government is looking for product flexibility to meet a wide variety of labeling requirements, and compliance with the intent of MIL-STD-130N.  For example, this includes material, imprint, and attachment options.  These should be clearly addressed in the proposal.
<br><br>
Add the following paragraph to Section M, under the heading -- M.2 - Step 1 - Evaluation of Technical Capability<br><br>

IUID DATA LABELS:  The Government will evaluate the degree to which the offer is flexible in its ability to provide product options (i.e., material, imprint, attachment, etc.) to meet a wide variety of labeling requirements. <br><br><br>

2.	The Government desires to take advantage of quantity discount pricing, if it is offered.  Since the Government does not know the quantities that will be requested under individual orders, there is currently no way to designate quantity discounts other than to hide them in unit prices.  To provide an alternate way of evaluating quantity discounts, Section L and M of the solicitation have been revised to include the evaluation of an item request quantity discount strategy.  This strategy will be evaluated as part of the technical evaluation.  The changes to the solicitation are as follows: <br><br>

Add the following paragraph to Section L --<br><br>

L.3.7.k.  Item Request Quantity Discount Strategy  At the option of the offeror, the offeror may propose an item quantity discount strategy.  The discount strategy, if quantity discounts are offered, shall apply to item quantity discounts given at the time IUID Data Labels are requested through the web-based interface.  The strategy should set forth the percent discount (not dollar amount) that will be offered on an individual label request based on the quantity ordered (specifying whether in total, by individual label material type, size, thickness, marking process, attachment method, delivery time, etc.).  The strategy may include tiered discounting.  If the discount strategy is to offer lower unit pricing (in Attachment 1), the offeror should clearly state this in the proposal. <br><br>

Add the following paragraph to Section M, under the heading -- M.2 - Step 1 - Evaluation of Technical Capability<br><br>

QUANTITY DISCOUNT STRATEGY:  The Government will evaluate each offerors Item Request Quantity Discount Strategy to determine the degree to which the strategy will save the Government money by making larger quantity label requests.

NAVAIR has scheduled an Industry Day for 12 February 2008 from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm at the Frank Knox Building, VIP Room, Patuxent River, Maryland.  The Frank Knox Building is located just outside gate 2 with the entrance south of gate 2.  Access to the base is not required. This Industry Day is open to all interested parties. The intent of this Enterprise Architecture (EA) Center of Excellence (COE) Industry Day is to provide our Industry partners with an opportunity to learn more about the Navy?s focus on information delivery in a network-enabled environment and the direction NAVAIR is taking towards the development of architectural artifacts.   While careful and strategic planning goes into the design, an enterprise architecture actually emerges as a result of implementing individual projects; therefore, it is critical that NAVAIR programs develop their DoDAF views and ISPs using a defined set of recognized tools and templates.  This will ensure interoperability with other programs and demonstrate how these architectural artifacts decompose from overarching architectures.  The COE exemplifies the new collaborative business model ? multi-agency shared services delivery models.  Learn more about the EA COE vision and the perceived way forward in architecture development for NAVAIR.

The capability statement package shall be sent by mail to the following address:  Department of the Navy, Contracts Department, Code 251521, Building 441, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, 21893 Bundy Road, Unit 7, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1463; or via email linda.p.nelson@navy.mil; or by facsimile to (301) 757-6516.  Submissions must be received at the office and cited no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EDT) on 28 February 2008.  Questions or comments regarding this notice may be addressed electronically to Linda Nelson at linda.p.nelson@navy.mil.  No phone calls will be accepted or returned.

BACKGROUND


The Census Bureau, Administrative Management Systems Division (AMSD), Census Hiring and Employment Check Branch (CHEC), is responsible for processing requests for criminal background checks on current Survey (Schedule A) employees, respondents, career appointees and Special Sworn Status employees.  This responsibility includes background check processing for the temporary employees hired to conduct decennial census pretests and for the Census itself.  The scope of the hiring effort is very large. During the peak hiring period for the 2000 Decennial Census, the Census Bureau conducted screenings on 3.7 million applicants, prior to selection and subsequent hiring of nearly 1 million employees.


DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES


The Census Bureau seeks to procure services of a contractor to fingerprint and train newly hired fingerprint examiners in support of recruiting and hiring efforts for the 2010 Decennial Census, in the use of proper fingerprinting techniques to perform a successful fingerprint capture.

The contractor shall train the fingerprint examiners to properly fingerprint individuals using ink and cards during the course of a two-day training session totaling 9 to 10 hours.  The contractor shall also fingerprint all the Census fingerprint examiners during the training session and mail the completed fingerprint cards to the Census Bureau for processing.  The contractor will train and fingerprint over approximately 228,461 fingerprint examiners during an anticipated 18-month training period.

	Step-by-step training on how-to perform 4-4-2 fingerprint process
	Step-by-step training techniques for capturing legible fingerprints
	Step-by-step training techniques to avoid fingerprint rejections
	Testing of fingerprint candidates to validate the attendees are properly trained to fingerprint.

3.	During the training sessions, the Contractor will use Census Bureau-provided training materials, such as training videos, fingerprint examiner training manuals, and instructor training manuals.

DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

1.	Respondents shall submit appropriate information about their company that will provide the Census Bureau insight into their capabilities and experiences.

All travel expenses will be incurred by the contractor and shall be included in the cost estimate.
