POC:  Preston Marshall, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA04-26@darpa.mil;  Web:  http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/CN/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencys (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design, and testing to support Phases II and III of the DARPA Connectionless Networks program.

OVERVIEW:  The Connectionless Networks (CN) program will develop technology to allow radio networks to send and receive messages without any initial link acquisition, or any previous sharing of routing information. This will, in turn, improve energy per bit of delivered information by as much as 100 - 1000 times compared to conventional and near-term deployable communications systems such as contemplated by both commercial and military users.

The technical approach is to exploit current signal processing components, intelligent (processing and memory intensive) routing, and availability of situational information to demonstrate a total energy savings of at least 100 times typical connection oriented network applications.  The first phase of the CN Program (not covered by this BAA) addressed Integrated Layer Design and Performance Prediction.  That approach investigated specific technology requirements for each of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) layers, leading to the development and analysis of sets of Implicit Protocols.  The effort considered both layer-specific and layer-integrating approaches, with particular attention given to combining the physical layer and media access, and to the functionality of a network and transport layer.  Simulation-based approaches were implemented to identify promising techniques for further development in the later phases.

PHASE II:  Phase II of the Connectionless Networks program should translate technology design and simulation into actual hardware and software.  Phase II should focus on device development, fabrication, and testing.  Phase II should result in a laboratory demonstration of the Connectionless Networks system implementation.

PHASE III:  Phase III (Option) of the Connectionless Networks program should consist of a field demonstration and an investigation of scalability.  The demonstration should implement the technologies developed in Phase II to demonstrate integrated network performance in a single design.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA04-26) on or before 12:00 noon, Local Time, Arlington, VA, 24 SEP 04.  

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business, small disadvantaged business, HBCU, or MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are, in order of importance: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Management Approach; (c) Cost Realism; and (d) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DoD Mission.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated PIP available at www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov, which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12.603 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The Government intends to award on a full and open competition basis.  The items listed below are specifications for the Austron Chassis Time Distribution Replacement.  This order will be firm-fixed price to be delivered 30 days after receipt of award. Require two of the following units to replace the Austron chassis and seven cards that are used in the Austron chassis.  One unit would be used for the automatic fail over switching and distribution of the 5 MHz signals that are generated from existing Agilent Cesium Beam Frequency Standards.  The other unit would be used for the automatic fail over switching and distribution of the IRIG-G (100 kHz) time codes that are generated from existing TrueTime GPS Time and Frequency receivers.  Since the time and frequency distribution system does not have a redundant backup and is therefore a possible single point of failure, we suggest that there be an additional unit purchased per system. Since both the time and frequency distribution units are identical, one spare on site would be sufficient to recover from the failure of one of these units. Each station would require three units (one for time, one for frequency, and one ready spare).  Purchase six additional spares bringing the total number of units to 27 (7X3+6).  The units cannot combine both the 5MHZ signal the IRIG-G time code into one chassis, there must be 60 dB of isolation of these signals to prevent any possible interference.  The units should be identical, with configuration differences limited to jumpers and/or software configurable parameters. Automatic fail over switch and distribution specifications 1.

FAR 52.217-8 AND 52.217-9 Option to extend contract.   The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation's minimum criteria for technical acceptability at the lowest price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. (Factor 1) To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must furnish product literature that demonstrates the products offered meet all requirements stated in the above purchase descriptions for Line Items 0001.  (Factor 2) Past Performance, contractors to submit previous three (3) contract numbers, names of agencies/companies and contacts for past three years.  (Factor 3) price  Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under factor 1 above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award. See paragraph b below. Only those offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor 1 will be further evaluated under Factors 2 and 3.  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor 1 to be technically acceptable., Factor 2 is approximately equal to Factor 3, price. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b) Technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement, Factor 1, will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to offerors - commercial items, subparagraph (b) 4 which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technical unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically  unacceptable may not be considered further for award. © Offeror's Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors - Commercial items, Subparagraph (6) 10, will be used  to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as in attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's past performance as follows: Neutral:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. Outstanding:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degration of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. Satisfactory:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. Marginal:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d) Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (of part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of  withdrawal is received before award.

<RESPDATE>100604
<ARCHDATE>08092005
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for a temporary holding facility (feed lot setting) to hold up to 2,500 wild horses/burros in a safe and humane condition. The period of performance will be one base year plus 4 one year option periods. The facility must be located in the state of Nevada, within 75 miles of the Bureau's preparation facility at Palomino Valley, 15780 SR 445, Reno, NV 89510. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements for the Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility:  a. Wild horses and burros on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340). As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt-A-Horse program. Before the horses are placed in the Adopt-A-Horse program or long term pasture holding, they are held in feedlot holding facilities. b. The BLM has initiated a management strategy that provides for the removal of more wild horses than our nationwide holding facilities can accommodate. The intent of this proposal is to provide a feed lot setting for these animals while they are cared for, until they are shipped to long-term holding or an adoption. The purpose of this solicitation is to provide for a facility located within the State of Nevada to facilitate the preparation of the animals after they are gathered. This is to facilitate the movement of horses and burros to decrease stress and injury and to ensure cost effective operation within the Wild Horse and Burro Program. This allows BLM to maintain an even flow of horses and burros from the gather site, to the preparation facility and on to the contract holding facility. The contractor must provide the following: land, pens, feed, salt, minerals and water necessary for maintaining approximately 2,500 wild horses; corrals and adequate facilities to load, unload, prepare, and sort wild horses; humane care of all wild horses during receiving holding and preparation, prior to shipment to long-term holding or adoption; regular, on-the-ground observation of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210.  This solicitation will be available at http://www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about August 23, 2004.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided.  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), plans to procure services on a sole source basis for Germline Genetic Variation and Risk of Chromosome Aberrations among Mayak Nuclear Workers with Southern Urals Biophysics Institute, Ozyorskoye shosse 19, Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk region, 456780, Russia.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) conducts studies regarding the role of radiation exposure in contributing to cancer etiology. REB has been integrally involved in investigations of the health effects of radiation in the Mayak nuclear worker cohort. Workers at the Mayak facility, the first nuclear production plant in the former Soviet Union, were exposed to much higher radiation doses than those received by their counterparts in other countries or considered permissible today.  In collaboration with Russian investigators, REB has conducted several studies in this population, including cancer mortality and a clinical thyroid study, and has collected biological samples and published joint manuscripts.  The objectives of this procurement is to enroll approximately 350 selected Mayak workers in the study, using an in-person structured interview to solicit information regarding other factors possibly related to SCA frequency; to collect additional information regarding the demographics and work history of participants from existing files.  Period of Performance:  Base year of twelve (12) months with four (4) optional years.  Southern Ural Biophysics Institute is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the services required.  The Mayak worker cohort is virtually the only population that has received more than minimal doses. The proposed co-investigators, Drs. Tamara Azizova and Galina Rusinova, have been conducting research within the Mayak cohort for some time, and are recognized experts in the biological effects of high-LET radiation, including plutonium.  In conjunction with investigators from Columbia University, they have obtained funding for the extremely expensive project of chromosome aberration assessment for 350 individuals in this population, without which the REB genetic study would not be possible.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, August 23, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40126-NG.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate, on a non-competitive basis, with Department of Public Health Sciences, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC 27167, to reformat data sets received from the completed clinical Activity Counseling Trail (ACT).  Through competitive procedures contracts were negotiated to perform clinical trails for various research initiatives.  Upon completion of those clinical trails data sets were delivered which compiled research data for used by other researchers in their own research investigations. Due to recent concerns about maintaining the confidentiality of patient data compiled as a result of  NHLBI’s clinical trails, the data sets are to be modified to allow use of the data without inadvertently unveiling patient identities.  The initial research institutions possess a unique familiarity with the clinical studies, and will be able to reformat the data sets systematically removing personal patient identifying information in a short period of time.  In order for NHLBI to meet the confidentiality requirements and to make the data sets available to the research investigators in a timely manner, an award to any other source for this requirement would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Background Information: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has supported collection data from participants in numerous clinical trails and epidemiologic studies.  These well-characterized population samples represent rare and valuable scientific resources.  In order to take full advantage of such resources and maximize their research value, it is important that data collected with public funds be made available, under appropriate terms and conditions, to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.  Under contact-supported studies, a limited access data set is required as a contract deliverable to the NHLBI.  In selected circumstances, such data sets also may be required of studies supported by cooperative agreements or grants.  In preparing data sets for releases the subject identifiers are removed.   Variables that might lead to the identification of subjects, such as outliers, dates, and study site in the case of multi-center studies, are removed or collapsed into larger cells.  Nevertheless, given enough information about an individual subject, coupled with publically available data, it may be possible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity of a particular subject.  Therefore, the data are not truly “anonymous” and are only provided to investigators agreeing to adhere to established polices for distribution.  Recently we have become aware that the data sets received before 2000, do not protect subject confidentiality to the extent we require under current NHLBI policy.   The purpose of this acquisition is to reformat the data sets from a selection of previously conducted clinical trials to meet current confidentiality and documentation requirements.   The period of performance is not expected to exceed twelve (12) months from date of award.  This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541710.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
	
Enantiomer Selectivity in Toxicity of Vinclozolin to Japanese Medaka Fish

Background

Endocrine disrupting chemicals have the potential to adversely impact reproductive processes.  Many environmental pesticides are known to possess endocrine disrupting properties.  The dicarboxyimide fungicide vinclozolin has been shown to induce cytochrome P450 in both mice and rat mammalian systems.  These monooxygenase enzymes are responsible for the hydrolysis of the parent vinclozolin and the known end-products have been shown to possess antiandrogenic properties in both mammals and fish.  Vinclozolin is a chiral compound; that is, it consists of two species called enantiomers – mirror image isomers that usually differ in their fate and effects.  For example, it is well known that in the great majority of cases enantiomers differ in their rates of microbial transformation, leading to selective occurrence of one over the other in the environment and biota.  Now it is deemed important to test the enantiomers of various pesticides for differences  in their toxic properties, since both toxicity and occurrence must be considered in making risk assessments.  In the present case, a species of a fish – the Japanese medaka – will be employed in a new approach to assay the two separate enantiomers of vinclozolin for differences related to the induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes.  This induction, as mentioned above, has already been proven for racemic vinclozolin (a mixture of equal amounts of the two enantiomers), but no work has been done with separate enantiomers to show any differences in their activity.  In addition, preliminary results indicate that more than one cytochrome P450 enzyme is being induced by vinclozolin upon exposure to the medaka.  This can be verified by separation and detection of the enzymes from the medaka liver using electrophoresis measurements followed by mass spectrometric protein characterization – the modern science of proteomics.  The hypothesis upon which this contract is based is that the induction process will operate at different rates for the two vinclozolin enantiomers, and that more than one cytochrome P450 enzyme is induced. 

Requirements      

The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:

1. Quality Assurance: Prepare a Category 4 Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  The Plan shall be delivered by the Contractor to the EPA Technical Coordinator and the Contracting Officer within 21 days after award of the contract.  The QAPP will be approved by the EPA within 7 days after receipt, after which time work can commence on the effort.  A copy of the approved QAPP must be forwarded to the Contracting Officer.

2. Exposure:  Exposure systems shall consist of three separate chemicals –  the two separated enantiomers of vinclozolin and the vinclozolin racemate, each at a concentration of 1.25ppm in the aquarium water – as well as a control without vinclozolin.  Each chemical and the control shall  be exposed in duplicate to 10 medaka fish for 72 hours to induce measurable amounts of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase.  Thus, the exposure regimen will require 8 exposure chambers and 80 fish.

3. Liver Sample Preparation: Microsomal isolates shall be prepared from the livers of the medaka that have been exposed as directed in 2 above.  Each of the 8 exposures shall require excision of liver tissues from the 10 fish, their combination and homogenization, and isolation of endoplasmic reticulum fragments in the form of a microsomal fraction corresponding to each exposure.

4. Proteomics: The 8 microsomal isolates shall each be separated into their protein components by gel electrophoresis, visualized by appropriate reagents, and their quantity measured by fluorescence  spectroscopy.  Comparison of protein bands and their quantities between enantiomers, the racemate and the control will indicate which proteins have been regulated by exposure to the various forms of vinclozolin.  Important bands shall be picked by robotic equipment and automatically submitted to the  mass spectrometer for possible identification of the protein.   

5. Final Report: A final report giving experimental procedures and results in both hard copy and electronic form (WordPerfect or Word) shall be submitted to the Technical Coordinator and Contracting Officer within 6 months after award of contract.  

6. EPA Provisions: The EPA will provide the racemic vinclozolin and separate vinclozolin enantiomers to be used in this work.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Recovery System Inc. for a modified design, installation, and operation of a testing unit and sampling stations under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, for the ORD/NRMRL/APPCD.   This acquisition is for a modified design and installation of a testing unit and sampling stations, and operation over a six (6) month period to analyze emission factors of a swine production facility located in Maury, NC.  The modified testing unit and sampling stations shall: (a) Test for pathogens before treatment and  their destruction after the process;  (b) Check the concentration and recovery levels of ammonium phosphate;  (c) Test for residual ammonia in the returned flushing liquid;  (d) Test the flow rates of liquids to determine the fresh water makeup and complete a hydraulic liquid balance;  (e) Sample  the air discharge from the air stripper to determine ammonia carry over;  (f) Sample the air discharge from the acid scrubber to determine the capture efficiency of the ammonia;  (g) Monitor the salt concentration in the flushing liquid. (Salt deposition will block the pipe system);  (h) Test the  digested feed solids in the methane generator  to determine the volume mass of methane per pound of digested material;  (i) Check the pH at the hold and mix tanks and at the solids separation tank;  (j)  Test digested feed solids before and after processing in the methane generator for nitrogen and  phosphorous content; (k) Check particle size of recovered feed and digested feed solids;  (l) Record recovery rates for undigested feed and digested feed;  (m) Dry the recovered feed and test its use as cattle feed and poultry litter;  (n) Tests the recovered feed for moisture content, after drying  together with nitrogen, protein, fat, fiber, NFE, carbohydrates, DIG energy, MET energy, and heavy metals. assist in reducing both air and water impacts from his swine production facility.  The EPA believes that Recovery System Inc. is the only firm able to provide the testing unit and sampling  stations due to the existence of a proprietary testing system that measures animal waste recovery with sampling stations used in previous testing with the farm owner.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required testing unit and  sampling stations, installation and operation on a swine production farm in Maury, NC may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of delivering this equipment and services.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A  determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to  proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   The U.S. EPA National Homeland Security Research Center, located in Research Triangle Park, NC, is currently evaluating the interaction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) with common interior surface materials, (also known as the sink effect). The main objective of this project is to recommend a sink model that can predict, with reasonable accuracy, the amount of VOCs and SVOCs adsorbed/absorbed by the surface materials. The output of this study has potential applications in both exposure modeling and building  protection.  There are two types of sink models, those based on surface adsorption and those based on molecular diffusion in the solids. Solid/air partition coefficient and molecular diffusion coefficient in solid material are two key parameters for the models in the latter category. Under this  requirement, the EPA requires a contractor to experimentally determine these physical properties for the materials selected by EPA. Specifically, the contractor shall experimentally determine the solid/air partition coefficient and apparent molecular diffusivity for 36 chemical/material  combinations.  The following materials and chemicals shall be tested and will be provided by the EPA: gypsum board (painted and unpainted), carpet, and vinyl flooring, ethylbenzene, n-decane, and n-dodecane.		 This acquisition is processed using full and open competition under NAICS code 541690.  The acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It is anticipated that a Request For Quotation (RFQ) will be issued on or about August 25, 2004. To receive a copy of the RFQ, interested firms must submit a written request to Mr. Josh Bowers  (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) by 2:00 PM EST TUESDAY AUGUST 24, 2004. Requests submitted via email are preferred or a fax is acceptable. The fax number is 513-487-2109. Requests must include company name, mailing address

An additional ICS 200 and the sample collection components is  needed so that simultaneous determination of both gases and particle components can be achieved. EPA believes that a critical need exists for purchasing the remaining components of the instrument from Dionex Corp in order to maintain instrument compatibility. The circumstance permitting "other than  full and open competition" FAR 6.302-1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement."  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities in writing within 15 days of the date of this  announcement. The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources (s) exist and, therefore, no RFP is available. Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will be ignored.   Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02) RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@ustda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Ministry of Communications of Afghanistan, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Fiber Optic Backbone Network Deployment Project of Afghanistan  :  The Ministry of Communications (MoC) of Afghanistan invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance in the deployment of a fiber optic backbone network in Afghanistan.  The chosen Contractor will provide technical assistance to MoC in refining the network specifications, securing the financing, and managing the tendering process for the Fiber Optic Backbone Network project.

Afghanistan has one of the weakest telecommunications systems in the world.  Immediately after the fall of the Taliban, only one out of every 625 Afghans had access to telephone service, yielding a “teledensity” of 0.16 telephone lines for every 100 people.  This level is far below the developing country average of 2.6 lines per 100, and well below the World Bank’s targets for effectively stimulating economic growth.  The use of ICT is similarly underdeveloped, while the pent-up demand is overwhelming.  Currently two cell phone systems are offering limited service in Kabul and MoC has ambitious plans for developing the country’s overall telecommunications infrastructure.

As this is an essential component for the development of a modern economy, USTDA has been supporting these efforts and previously provided an advisor to MoC and funded a Feasibility Study (Study) on a Telecommunications Backbone in Afghanistan.  Upon completion of the Study, MoC requested assistance with the tendering process for this project, at which point USTDA funded a Definitional Mission to scope out this request and identify other ICT project opportunities.  The recent Definitional Mission confirmed that MoC considers the implementation of this project to be a priority and that MoC indeed requires technical assistance for the implementation process.  As currently envisioned, this fiber optic ring would connect the country’s major cities (Kabul; Kandahar; Herat; Mazar e Sharif; and Baglan), paralleling the national roadway network wherever possible.  When completed, the ring would be capable of serving as a telecommunications backbone for approximately 90% of the country’s population.

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $219,550 grant to MoC from USTDA.  
 

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or Afghanistan.   The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host countries for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to Ministry of Communications of Afghanistan c/o USTDA by 4:00 P.M. September 24, 2004, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  MoC reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  MoC also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  MoC is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Integrated Aqua Systems, Inc. in San Diego, CA to furnish and deliver two (2) EACH;  516 Gallon Integrated-Aqua Research Recirculating Systems and associated appurtenances.  These items shall be delivered FOB Destination to the USDA, ARS, National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture (NCCCWA) in Kearneysville, WV.  These systems will be used for our research on broodstock enhancement and improvement in rainbow trout growth, growth and feed efficiency and disease resistance utilizing methods to influence the animal's own hormonal systems using hormones, environmental alteration and manipulation of dietary components.  The recirculating system need to be able to operate under conditions of full, partial, or complete flow-through (continuous fresh water rather than recirculated water), to allow for maximum ability to be a multi-user/flexible use system.  The recirculation system must have 12-self-cleaning, circular, fiberglass tanks (~40 gallon) to ensure maximum flow and cleanliness for animals that have undergone surgical procedures.  Stand-pipe fittings must be integrated (fiberglassed) into the bottom of the tanks for maximum durability and also permits the tanks to operate as self-cleaning tanks.  Fiberglass is required to prevent leaching out of plastic which can influence the animal's physiology.  The recirculating system must have a self-contained plastic-coated steel holding system with laminated, plastic-coated, shelved for enhanced resistance to rust or corrosion buildup and is non-toxic to the fish.  The system must include the following: 1) a self-contained, plumed, filtration system that is skid mounted, and which has high-efficiency filtration for particulates. 2) an ultraviolet (UV) sterilizer for sterilization of the water.  3) a water and air pumps.  4) a low-profile (space) sump tank for collection of used water.  5) a integrated (single system) bio-filtration module that is capable of denitrifying used water and oxygenating (a) degassing up-draft counter flow of clean air) used water.  6) a temperature control which is capable of heating and cooling the water within one (1) degree Celsius of the desired temperature.  7) a Heat pump that includes a high-efficiency titanium heat exchanger that transfers excess heat into a waste-water stream rather than into the room.  8) A modular and plumed manifold system for delivering filtered/sterilized water and air to each tank.  The integrated life-support system is proprietary to Integrated Aqua Systems, Inc. and includes a standard commercial warranty on the equipment.  Companies with the demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide and service such equipment must submit a written substantive statement outlining the Company's and systems' capabilities to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of publication of this notice.

<DESC>There is no formal solicitation document for this acquisition.  A Project Agreement will serve as the initial solicitation document (see below).  The Forest Service, in coordination with the Department of the Interior (including at least the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation), and the US Army Corps of Engineers, has a need for a national, consolidated, reservation service contract in support of the National Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) Program.  Through the Project Agreement, the Forest Service is seeking a contractor to develop and operate a state-of-the-art reservation service, complete with facilities, personnel, marketing, materials, equipment, communications, information distribution, and transaction record processing.  The NRRS will provide opportunities for customers to reserve, in advance, specific Federal recreation facilities and activities.  The NRRS includes, but is not limited to, camping reservations, wilderness permit reservations, tour ticketing, and lotteries.  Reservations will be made through multiple sales channels.  This acquisition will integrate recreation reservation requirements for National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, US Army Corps of Engineers, and USDA Forest Service activities.  Incumbent contractors include Spherix, Inc. for the National Park Reservation Service (NPRS) and ReserveAmerica, Inc. for the current NRRS.  A principal objective of this new acquisition is to replace these separate reservation capabilities with one consolidated service.  A Project Agreement will be posted on or about December 5, 2003 on the Internet at www.recreation.gov/contract focusing on industry capabilities and high-level solutions.  In accordance with this acquisition process, the Project Agreement will serve as the initial solicitation document.  This step will be followed by the issuance of a Statement of Need on or about March 8, 2004 addressing specific outcomes, best-of-breed vendor solutions and costs/fees.  An Industry Day is scheduled for December 11, 2003, however, definitive information on the Industry Day will be contained within the Project agreement.  This acquisition will be awarded under NAICS Code 561599 based on full and open competition. This acquisition will be conducted using a streamlined acquisition process intended to provide an improved acquisition environment intended to benefit both the vendor community and the Government.  To be eligible for award, interested parties must respond to the Project Agreement in order to be considered for the Statement of Need and subsequent award of any resulting contract.  A copy of the Project Agreement may be obtained by registering at www.recreation.gov/contract.  Potential offerors are requested to submit questions to Contract@Recreation.gov.  Answers will be disseminated via the Internet and posted at www.recreation.gov/contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The RFP will contain the requirements necessary for the short-listed D-B teams/firms to submit both a Technical Proposal and a Price Proposal during Phase Two.  Those firms will be required to provide the necessary information to the EFLHD within 60 calendar days after receiving the RFP.  A site visit/pre-proposal meeting will be held within the first 21 days of this period to provide additional information.  It is anticipated that a stipend will be awarded to each Phase Two offeror who provides a responsive, but unsuccessful proposal (see Subsection I.A.6 of the RFP).  A copy of the draft RFP is available to interested D-B firms/teams during Phase One.

After receipt of the Phase Two Technical and Price Proposals, an Evaluation Board will conduct a “best value” analysis (see Subsection I.B.6 of the RFP), and submit their recommendations to the Selection Official for approval.  Award of one Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated approximately January 15, 2005, with Notice to Proceed issued approximately February 15, 2005.

It is not the intent of EFLHD to receive project specific design or engineering recommendations as part of this Phase One selection process.  Offerors should limit their submittals to the information required by this Notice, and other information that may be relevant to the qualifications and experience of the Offeror.  No reimbursement will be made for any expenses associated with the preparation of Phase One submittals.

Phase One Submittals:  Interested firms/teams may use Standard Forms (SF) 330 U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, as the basis for their submittals.  SF 330 is available on the Government Printing Office’s website at: http://hydra.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_files.  Although SF 330 is formatted for Architect-Engineer and Related Services, the construction elements of the firms/team’s submittal may also be included on SF 330.  Alternate forms and formats may be submitted, provided that the applicable information from SF 330 is included.  The Phase One submittals shall be bound and tabbed with the major headings.

Send eight (8) copies of the completed submittals to the following address:

	Federal Highway Administration
	Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division
	21400 Ridgetop Circle

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/INDUSTRY DAYS FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III) ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought/Industry Days Parts and  Repair Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However, the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

INTRODUCTION: Our goal is to develop an acquisition strategy that allows us  to achieve outstanding performance while significantly reducing our cost of  doing business with a manageable level of risk.  While we welcome your input  throughout the acquisition process, your suggestions and comments will be  especially valuable as we develop our acquisition strategy.   2.  BACKGROUND:  Program Title The Parts and Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) is a service contract managed  by the Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC). It is available to satisfy  logistics requirements for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  PROS II  provides a capability to purchase a wide range of nonstandard and difficult to  support standard parts and maintenance services.  PROS II also provides a  vehicle for contracting for specialized engineering and technical services  through task orders. Contract Effort Description The PROS II Program functions much the same as an Air Logistics Center.  The  contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance  services and the management of task orders.  The contract is managed by a  dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s performance  and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS II are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However, the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. Note: See chart one for how the PROS II program process works.  SAMIS stands  for Security Assistance Management Information System. Developmental Phase PROS III the Follow-on to PROS II  We are entering the developmental phase of the follow-on to PROS II.   Chart Two Explanation Chart shows PR (purchase request) being offered up to contractors A and B (1)  for competitive supply/maintenance fill action.  Contractors A and B in competition with each other go to their OEM partners or  competitive vendors (2) for quotes. Price and Lead Time (LT) are provided to the USAF by contractors A and B (3)  and the USAF then selects the best offer (4). The contractor (A or B) with the best offer receives the order (5) and they  issue a contract (6) with the appropriate vendor. Shipment is made as quoted (7) and services charges are paid (8). Winner takes all.  The loosing contractor receives no recompense for their  efforts unless they win an award to fill an order. Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Possible options include, but would not be limited to, multiple award and other  Governmental agencies receiving orders with respect to contractor B. Goal Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.  We are  soliciting comments from industry on the attached approach (chart two) with  regard to feasibility, suggested incentives and interest in PROS III  participation. 3. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not  constitute a solicitation.  The RFI shall not be construed as an obligation on  the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  The Government  does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI and all  information shall be made available at not cost to the Government.  Responses  to the RFI will not be returned.   4.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Human & Robotic Technology which was posted on June 29, 2004. You are notified that the following changes are made: Posting of additional Questions and Answers and a revision to the BAA, Appendix C. paragraph 2a. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=04  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A link to briefing charts and further details on the BAA is located at: https://naccsli1.msfc.nasa.gov/ExplorationPortal I.  Cont'd Questions/Answers: Q40.  Will CCEI support software or just hardware? A40.  CCEI will support software that is directly related to the particulars of the hardware it runs on.  All software that is hardware independent falls under SISM or ASCT areas. Q41.  If a waiver of inventions is requested after contract selection will NASA grant a waiver of inventions so the contractor will own inventions it creates or will NASA only  consider a waiver of inventions? If NASA will only consider a waiver of inventions will NASA accept a proposal with a contingency whereby the offeror can withdraw from consideration (award) if approval is not granted?  A41. All requests for advance waivers are considered when timely submitted.  The NASA Inventions and Contributions Board normally will recommend grant of a request for advance waiver of domestic rights submitted prior to execution of contract or within 30 days after execution of the contract. While there are circumstances where the Board can find that the interests of the United States will be better served by restricting or eliminating all or part of the rights of the contractor, this rarely occurs.  (See, 14 CFR 1245.104) If an advanced waiver is not granted the contractor can still petition NASA for waiver of each invention as they arise under the contract. Waivers are liberally granted.  NASA does not accept proposals with contingencies.  We encourage the contractor to submit the waiver request early so that it knows what the answer will be early in the process. Q42.  Under the HESS Technology Element Program, High-Efficiency/Power and Low-Mass Electromagnetic (EM) Propulsion Systems theme, does the reference to output power greater than 500 kW imply that a single thruster of at least 500 kW is needed, or is there an interest in systems consisting of several lower-power thrusters that total 500 kW? A42.  A system of multiple smaller thrusters with total output power of 500 kW is acceptable as long as the integrated performance of the multiple-thruster system is demonstrated. Q43.  On page 9 paragraph 11, Past performance of Offeror's team.  The past performance includes subcontracts over $500,000.  Does this contradict paragraph 14, g, on page 12 which states, "major subcontractors are defined as those subcontracts in excess of $550,000 per year" and on page 14 which states, "with proposals exceeding $550,000."?   A43.  No, data applies to two different categories in the proposal.  One is for past performance and the other is for pricing submission. II.  Revision to the BAA Note. Appendix C, paragraph 2.a is revised to clarify that the 75 words per person for Key Personnel Background Summaries does not include the titles of 1-2 papers that each key member has published or presented at a conference.	An amended BAA will be posted at the website noted above.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Retrofit of Transmitters with Digital HF Exciter
<SOLNBR>BBGCON3604S5431
<CONTACT>David Lum, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-205-9587, Fax 202-260-0855, Email dlum@ibb.gov
<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau  (IBB) require the performance of their existing transmitters to be enhanced by retrofitting them with digital exciters capable of generating a suitable Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) signal format.  The anticipated requirement will be accomplished via a two-step acquisition process.  To pre-qualify, potential sources shall provide sufficient technical documentation to BBG/IBB to demonstrate that their proposed DRM exciter can successfully be integrated into the following transmitter types when those transmitters are equipped with solid-state modulators manufactured by Continental Electronics or others; the Marconi B6128 and B6132, the Continental Electronics Model 418, 419 (all models) and 420B, and the Brown Boveri SK53 and SK55.  To be acceptable, the Offeror's transmitter(s) must be capable of performance that complies with all IBB contractual specifications when performance data is measured at the output port of the transmitter.  The IBB specification will reference the latest version of European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ESTI), ES 201 980, as the governing document containing criteria for DRM performance.  Portions of the original transmitter performance criteria that are applicable to personnel and equipment safety, audio performance, and unwanted emissions will also be applicable.  Alternate proposals may be submitted if they are clearly marked as such for separate evaluations.  IBB will allow each potential Offeror access to appropriate IBB transmitting stations and to representative transmitter types as needed to allow the Offeror to develop integration techniques for their DRM exciters and to perform demonstrations to the IBB.    In the second step of the procurement, those Pre-Qualified Offerors will be invited to submit a COST PROPOSAL AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE for a specified number of DRM exciters complete with any supplemental parts or items needed for DRM compliant operation along with the final retrofit plans for each transmitter type, spare parts lists and operations and maintenance manuals for the DRM exciter as well as complete schematics and mechanical drawings for the retrofit.   As an option, Pre-Qualified Offerors may also be asked to provide technical support during the conversion of IBB transmitters.  The successful Offeror will be awarded a contract for the delivery of the specified exciter and all related equipment/accessories required for the installation, testing and operation of the above mentioned transmitter types.  IBB is also interested in measuring devices capable of decoding the DRM data format; Offerors are encouraged to include information about them in their submittals.  Qualified sources will be required to provide retrofit, test, and modify/enhance the operational performance of existing transmitters with a digital HF exciter capable of quadrature amplitude transmission.  The BBG/IBB intends to issue a full and open unrestricted solicitation document in accordance with FAR Part 15 for a negotiated firm fixed-price (FFP) procurement with Pre-Qualified Phase One proposals due thirty (30) calendar days thereafter.  Cost proposals and delivery schedules will be due 30 days after Offerors are notified they have satisfied Pre-Qualification criteria.   Award will be based upon product performance, availability and delivery schedule, price and the evaluation criteria stated in the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal to the BBG Contracting Officer at the above listed address in response to the forthcoming Solicitation No BBGCON3604S5431.  Oral expressions of interest will not be accepted.  Any questions related to the subject solicitation must be submitted in writing to the attention of the Contracting Officer.  All written expressions of interest shall specifically reference this FBO Notice by its title and date of publication.  This notice is not a RFQ, RFP, or an IFB.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SUBJECT:  Reduction of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility Study The Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) seeks to determine if existing contractors are capable of studying the feasibility of reducing the size of the DPMO Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) and the implications of reta ining a small SCIF within the boundaries of the existing office.  If DPMO and the contractor(s) determine the proposed reduction of the size of the SCIF to be feasible, the contractor(s) should advise DPMO of their capability to assist DPMO to implement th e recommended plan. DPMO employs a staff of 140 personnel in approximately 25,000 square feet of leased commercial space at 1745 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 800, Arlington, Virginia, 22202.  The portion of DPMO removed from SCIF operations will convert to an unclassified f acility with limited personnel access. The study should: Ã‚Â·	Address the implications, advantages and disadvantages of converting a large portion of DPMOÃ¢Â€Â™s current office space from a classified to an unclassified facility. Ã‚Â·	Include implications in regard to budget savings; employment security clearance requirements; potentially lower personnel grade requirements for employees; work efficiency; public perception of openness and accessibility to DPMOÃ¢Â€Â™s work; the relat ionships between DPMO, the national Intelligence Community, other Departments and Agencies of the USG, and non-Governmental agencies; etc. Ã‚Â·	Address the implications, advantages and disadvantages of adjoining classified and unclassified facilities, to include the interface between collateral and compartmented information, and the impact on interaction and operations between the two levels; Ã‚Â·	Address the implications of maintaining three local area networks (LANs) at the Unclassified, Secret, and Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) that maintain connectivity between the SCIF and unclassified portion of the office; Ã‚Â·	Identify logistical and personnel placement requirements, to include which personnel reside within the SCIF area, physical size of the area, computer support and equipment, and accessibility; Ã‚Â·	Develop a phased restructure plan and timeline to include facility reconstruction, personnel and equipment; Ã‚Â·	Recommend a plan of execution; and Ã‚Â·	Support DPMO in implementing the plan, as required. The contractor(s) should complete the study (minus support in implementing the plan) and submit a written report to the Director, DPMO, not later than six months following award of the study contract.  DPMO requests an initial response from Defense Contrac ting Command - Washington as soon as possible but not later than June 30, 2004. Security Clearance Requirement: Individuals conducting the study must possess a Top Secret security clearance with SCI access. The points of contact are Mr. Angel Beltran, 703-699-1125 and Mr. John A. Brown, 703-699-1185. Chief of Staff_________

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service, on behalf of the Air Force Safety Center (AFSC), Kirtland AFB, NM intends to award a contract for the following described effort.  Background: The Mishap Analysis & Animation Facility (MAAF) is the central Air Force focal point for the extraction and analysis of recorded data from USAF aircraft following a mishap or incident.  The recorded data may come from a flight data recorder (FDR), cockpit voice recorder (CVR), radar, telemetry and other sources.  Much of the MAAF’s equipment was procured in the mid-1990’s and has had no technology refresh or upgrades since then.  The computer equipment is obsolete and cannot be upgraded.  A number of Air Force program offices never procured equipment to process recorded data for their aircraft.  MAAF capability to process data from those aircraft is minimal at best and more often non-existent.  Objectives:  At the conclusion of this task, the MAAF will have a modern and comprehensive capability for processing recorded data from all Air Force aircraft.  The contractor will be responsible for performing the following tasks.  (1)  Process Development Task - The contractor shall develop custom replay procedures; techniques; and plotting and animation templates to extract, analyze and present data from FDRs and CVRs, whether damaged or undamaged.  The contractor shall provide all necessary equipment to integrate the solution into the MAAF’s existing system.  The contractor shall modify and extend the source code to Flightscape Inc's Insight software to ensure that raw binary data extracted from the FDR can be imported directly into Insight.  The contractor shall provide all necessary training and documentation required to utilize the hardware, software and custom replay procedures.  (2)  Software Integration Task - The contractor shall modify and extend the source code to Flightscape Inc's Insight software to enable mapping and imagery data to be imported directly into Insight.  The mapping and imagery data shall be in the format used by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The contractor shall provide all necessary training and documentation to allow MAAF personnel to utilize the import function.

The period of performance for the above task is 12 months with an anticipated start date of Sep 2004. Respondents should provide a Statement of Capability demonstrating their ability to fulfill the above requirements within the period of performance in order for AFSC to determine the requirements can be met. Statements of Capability are limited to a total of five (5) pages.  Submit responses electronically to gary.duffala@gsa.gov and to jeff.barnette@kirtland.af.mil no later than 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement by 4:00 PM, Mountain Daylight Savings Time.  Companies wishing to be placed on the bidders list for this requirement are to respond by e-mail to gary.duffala@gsa.gov (negative responses are not required).  In your response, indicate exactly how your company name is registered in GSA's ITSS system and the name of the person listed in ITSS to whom the RFQ announcement should be sent. Please note that the person named must also be registered in ITSS and associated with your GSA schedule contract. To be considered for this requirement, your company information must be registered in GSA's ITSS system as of 20 Aug 2004.   To register a designated person and your company in IT-Solutions, go to IT-Solutions.gsa.gov and follow the directions under the drop down menu “Tell Me About Registration”.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT   
 

This is a Sources Sought Notice only.    This is not a request for proposal, but a survey to locate potential sources.    The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) is performing a market survey to determine if there are an adequate number of interested and qualified firms, having the capability to provide up-front financing for the design, construction and operation of a 59 MGD (million gallons per day) secondary wastewater treatment plant with supporting facilities.    Construction of the wastewater treatment plant will take place in Tijuana, Mexico.    

We are seeking interested firms that have the ability to provide up-front financing and serve as the contract administrators for this project, which has an estimated cost of between $300 and $600 million.    The firm will only provide up-front financing for this project but is not the responsible party for the design, construction and operations of the project.    The design, construction and operation of the project will be contracted in accordance with competitive bid requirements as prescribed under Mexican law.    Design and construction of the project is expected to take 18 to 24 months.    The USIBWC will request funding for this effort through the U.S. Federal Budget Process and will be diligent in working with members of Congress and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on an annual basis; however, in the event that funding is not appropriated the USIBWC is not required to make any payment.    In order to successfully enter into a contract with an interested firm, the firm must agree to enter into such contract at its own risk; the contract will also include a provision specifying that no cancellation/ termination fee will be paid.    The firm will be the owner of the facility for the term of the contract or until all fees are fully paid, whichever is sooner.    The contract is expected to be an operating lease or a fee for services contract.   The USIBWC is expected to initiate payments to the firm two years after construction has been completed; payments are contingent upon receiving funding appropriations from Congress on an annual basis.  

All interested firms must notify this office in writing by mail or fax by May 28, 2004.  Responses shall include:

  
(1)	Identification and verification of the firm’s capabilities to provide up-front financing for an estimated project cost between $300 and $600 million.

(2)	Annual financial report for the last five years. 

(3)	Letter from a financial institution confirming the firm’s capability of obtaining up-front financing.  

This Sources Sought Notice is issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This is not a request for proposal, but a survey to locate potential sources and provides additional information to that previously provided in the Sources Sought Notice posted March 22, 2004.  The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) is performing a market survey to determine if there is an adequate number of interested and qualified firms, having the capability to fund the capital development costs for the design and construction in the vicinity of Tijuana, Mexico of a 59 MGD (million gallons per day) secondary wastewater treatment plant with supporting facilities, to include a pumping/conveyance system for the conveyance of 25 MGD of advanced primary effluent from the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant in San Ysidro, California to the secondary treatment plant in Mexico and from the treatment plant in Mexico to the South Bay Ocean Outfall in the United States.  The project will be carried out consistent with Public Law 106-457 (22 U.S.C. Section 277d-43 et seq.) and International Boundary and Water Commission Minute No. 311.  The firm selected will be responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations of the United States, State of California and Government of Mexico regarding water quality, including compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq.).    

We are seeking interested firms that have the ability to provide up-front financing for this project.   The firm selected will be responsible for the design, construction and operations of the treatment plant and will use competitive procedures applicable in Mexico for the procurement of property or services for engineering, construction, and operation and maintenance of the Mexican facility.  The final design of the facilities to be constructed in Mexico will be subject to the approval of the U.S. and Mexican Governments. Design and construction of the project is expected to take 18 months to 2 years.  The USIBWC anticipates entering into an operating lease contract under which it will make payments, subject to the availability of U.S. Congressional annual appropriations, for the engineering, construction, and for a period of 20 years the operation and maintenance of the Mexican facility, in an amount up to $156 million or such amount as the Congress may subsequently authorize.  No payments will be made until after construction has been completed, operations have been initiated, and funds have been appropriated and are available to the USIBWC for this purpose.  Payments will also be contingent upon verification by the IBWC that the effluent treated at the Mexican facility complies with the water quality laws of the United States, the State of California and Mexico.    The USIBWC will seek funding for this project through the U.S. Federal Budget Process and will be diligent in working with all relevant Federal Government parties on an annual basis.  Upon termination of the contract, the facilities constructed in Mexico will be transferred in adequate operating condition to the responsible Mexican authorities.

All interested firms should notify this office in writing by mail or fax by July 2, 2004.   Responses shall include:
 
§	Identification and verification of the firm's capabilities to provide up-front financing to cover the costs for design, construction and related costs for the proposed project.  
§	Annual financial reports for the last five years.
§	Past experience with projects that are similar in size, scope and complexity to the proposed project, both in the United States and Mexico.
§	Letter from a financial institution confirming the firm's capability of obtaining up-front financing to cover the design, construction and related costs associated with the proposed project.
§	Description of ability to develop the project envisioned in Public Law 106-457 and International Boundary and Water Commission Minute No. 311.

<SUBJECT>U -- Geriatric Education Center National Technical Assistance Center
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA) intends to contract with, on a sole source basis,  the Case Western Reserve University(CWRU), Cleveland, Ohio.  This contract, authorized by Title VII, Section 753(a), of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, is needed to establish a Geriatric Education Centers National Technical Assistance Center (NTAC).  The CWRU is the lead organization for the data management and evaluation task force for the National Association of Geriatric Education Centers.  The CWRU has developed a data management system to provide these services.  Any other organization would require an exorbitant amount of time and funds to reproduce the CWRU data management system.  The CWRU is uniquely capable and has the personnel experience and information systems resources to carry out all of the tasks of this requirement.  This center will serve as the primary focal point to provide technical assistance in the areas of data collection tools, methods, systems and evaluation with a goal to evaluate tertiary outcomes (i.e., the effect of geriatric education and training on patients).  The CWRU is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the services without a substantial duplication of cost to the Government which would not be expected to be recovered through competition.  This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition(JOFOC) is processed under the authority in 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation.  A copy of the JOFOC is on file.  

A one(1) year contract with a base year and four(4) one year option periods is planned.   A JOFOC is on file.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Small Business Administration - two corrections to Small Business Size Regulations affecting
<DESC>SBA recently made two technical corrections to the final rule amending part 1 of its Small Business Size Regulations (13 CFR § 121). The final rule itself appeared in the Federal Register on May 21, 2004 (69 FR 29192). Specifically -- (1) The final rule amended the definitions of affiliation and employees and made procedural and technical amendments to cover several of SBA’s programs. These amendments apply to all solicitations issued on or after June 21, 2004, as well as all applications for financial or other assistance pending as of or submitted to the SBA on or after June 21, 2004. The amendments apply to all follow-on or contract renewals and size representations submitted as part of an order issued pursuant to a contract (if the Contracting Officer has reserved the order for small businesses and requested a size certification) on or after December 21, 2004. The amendments apply to all novation and change-of-name agreements executed pursuant to FAR 42.12 on or after December 21, 2004. The SBA believes it is necessary to delay applicability of this rule for such situations because some novations may be in the progress of completion, but not yet completed at this time and this change in applicability date will not hinder the progress of such agreements. This technical correction was published in the Federal Register on July 30, 2004. It is available for reading and/or download at TEXT PDF; (2) The final rule also amended the regulations that govern the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program. The corrected provision concerns who may initiate a size protest or initiate a size determination. The correction appeared in the Federal Register on July 26, 2004. Please go to http://www.sba.gov/size/indexwhatsnew.html#part121techcorr or to http://www.regulations.gov for further information.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance / Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as required delivery dates, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal, that meets the government’s required delivery dates, will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the list of contract line items above.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision) 

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its offer. 

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>THE DATE AND TIME FOR THE SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS IS BEING EXTENDED TO AUGUST 17, 2004, CLOSE OF BUSINESS.  THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS SUBMITED WILL BE FORTH COMING...

Statement of Work for – Assessment of DOC Compliance Program


The Department of Commerce has a requirement to provide the Agreements Compliance unit is seeking proposals for issuing a questionnaire, hosting focus groups, and/or conducting interviews to gather strategic feedback from core and target customers.  These surveys will provide reactions to MAC’s publicly available tools, informational outreach efforts, customer service regarding compliance casework, and new initiatives for exporters.

Background

In 2003, the Department of Commerce’s (DOC’s) International Trade Administration (ITA) conducted a bureau-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey covering all ITA program units.  ITA’s Market Access and Compliance (MAC) program survey report identified gaps between a high level of customer awareness yet low customer use of fair trade and market access services.  Findings also indicate that a substantial customer base is unaware of the specific services that the DOC Compliance Program offers.

In response to the survey findings, MAC is proposing to conduct a survey and/or focus groups to assess, in more specific terms and greater detail, what is MAC’s Trade Compliance Center’s (TCC’s) customers expectations.  This will enable the TCC to answer: “What Do Customers Want from the DOC’s Compliance Program?”   Information about the TCC can be found on its website at www.export.gov/tcc. 


Work Description

The Department of Commerce’s (DOC) International Trade Administration (ITA) has made great strides in monitoring ITA’s customer satisfaction and advancing a strategic approach to delivering value to its customers.  

The purpose of this Work is to obtain customer and potential customer views regarding the DOC Compliance Program to determine:
 
&#61553;	If the TCC offers the right set of services to assist U.S. exporters to overcome foreign trade barriers
 

&#61553;	If MAC is aware of exporter needs
&#61553;	If the right MAC programs are in place to meet identified needs
&#61553;	If MAC services are properly promoted to maximize efficiency and effectiveness
	
	In order to continue to monitor customer satisfaction and improve the customer experience, this work requires the following deliverables:
	
 

•	Design and administer a MAC survey based on the TCC-relevant recommendations identified during the ITA-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey
•	Development of an interview guide and conduct focus groups and/or interviews to obtain additional information regarding the survey findings and address the desired outcomes
•	Analysis and recommendations based on survey and focus group questions that address the following key issues
	
	The primary scope and outcomes from this work include the following:
 

&#61553;	Analysis of what ‘customers’ expect of Commerce compliance services and how expectations match ability of the TCC to deliver those services 
&#61553;	Recommendations on how to improve customer awareness and use of products and services (what tools & how are they used)
 

&#61553;	Identification of opportunities to increase Market Access and Compliance case intake
 

&#61553;	Identification of which monitoring and outreach tools work best and which could be improved or added (best distribution/communication channels)
&#61553;	Identification of data for areas of client demand where product or services are needed but do not exist
 

&#61553;	Analysis of customer perceptions about resolving foreign trade barriers
 

&#61553;	Analysis of what prevents potential customers from using Commerce Compliance Program services
 

&#61553;	Assessment of how well the Liaison subprogram is delivering value
 

	
	Alternatives 
	
	Market Access and Compliance is considering the two options below and requests a proposal outlining the approach, activities, and timing for executing a survey and/or focus group that will target the following customer segments:
	
 

a.	 Active customers: Existing TCC customers who will be able to comment on the effectiveness of MAC’s current programs, identify repeat business opportunities, and suggest potential improvements
b.	 Prospective customers: Exporters who are aware of the TCC, but currently do not seek assistance and will be able to provide insight regarding what would motivate them to use the TCC’s programs
c.	 Untapped customers: Exporters who are unaware of the TCC’s products and services and will be able to provide insight regarding how the TCC can best increase its customer base through awareness and promotional efforts 
	
	Option 1.  Conduct a Customer Survey and Focus Groups to Assess the Effectiveness of the Compliance Program – The contractor shall provide an outline of the specific tasks involved in administering a survey and series of focus groups/interviews, including questionnaire development, design, approval, and execution.  The purpose of the survey will be to obtain cross-TCC specific information on the customer’s needs, experience with the TCC, and overall satisfaction.  The focus groups will then use the survey findings to gain a deeper understanding of issues identified.
 

	
	Option 2.  Conduct Focus Groups Only to Assess the Effectiveness of the Compliance Program – The contractor shall clearly outline the specific tasks involved in administering a series of interactive customer focus groups, including the internal MAC preparation meetings, focus group questions, related facilitation materials.  The purpose of the focus groups will be to gain a better understanding of the issues identified in the ITA-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey.  The focus groups will also target the above-listed customer segments.  
	
	Each option shall conclude with a summary and more detailed report of the data and analysis (specify presentation medium), which will outline the primary recommendations for improving the TCC’s compliance program.
	
	Deliverables

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)

RESEARCH INTEREST SPECIFICS

A.  INTRODUCTION

This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Concept and Technology Development Division, Enterprise Management Program Office, of the Air Armament Center (AAC/XRS), Eglin AFB FL, under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs.  It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs.

AAC/XRS contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology.  This BAA is intended to cover the research area of interest only to this Division as an unrestricted solicitation.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to AAC/XRS should not only carefully examine this BAA, but are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AAC/XRS Point of Contact (POC) identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest which AAC/XRS may have in a specific research project.  AAC/XRS anticipates award of two firm fixed-price IDIQ contracts with a maximum value of $2M each, with an anticipated 30-month period of performance. Proposal due date will be determined by the Government after receipt of the White Papers. However, prior to submitting a formal proposal, offerors are required to submit a two to three page white paper on their proposed research topic no later than 15 Jul 2004.  The white paper should also address data rights associated with the research, current security clearances of key personnel and facilities, and the proposed total contract price with a summary by major cost element, i.e., labor, materials, travel, overhead, G&A and profit.  A detailed breakdown is not needed nor requested.  Submit white papers to the following address: Air Armament Center, Concept and Technology Development Division, AAC/XRS, Attn: Mr. Ron Rapp, 207 West D Ave, Suite 301, Bldg 349, Eglin AFB FL 32542, or email to aacyec@eglin.af.mil .   The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a formal proposal.  The formal proposal shall be IAW Part II.  Such invitation, however, does not assure that a contract will be awarded.  Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received for immediate negotiation or held for consolidated evaluation. 

Note there is no inherent funding associated with this BAA. 

This BAA will remain open until 31 Oct 2004.  It may be superceded prior to that date and may be amended at any time. 

No further new or revised submissions are requested by the Government as a result of this amendment.  White Paper due date remains unchanged.

B. MISSION

The Concept and Technology Development Division, Enterprise Management Program Office, Air Armament Center (AAC/XRS) is the primary Air Force organization concerned with future air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions technology development.  AAC/XRS works hand-in-hand with the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Weapons to formulate the Air Armament Roadmap.  AAC/XRS conducts Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations, plans for and executes research, development, and test of future munitions, conducts pre-Milestone B risk reduction activities, and facilitates transition of munitions technology to System Program Offices.  

C. PROSPECTIVE RESEARCH AREA 

The following narrative provides an abbreviated description of the prospective research area mentioned briefly in the ABSTRACT.  The description is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit innovative proposals that have the potential to dramatically shift existing air delivered penetrating munition paradigms.  The description furnishes specific examples of areas of interest.  However, any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals.  

HEAVY PENETRATOR NAVIGATION, GUIDANCE, & CONTROL TECHNOLOGY RISK REDUCTION 

The Department of Defense (DoD) is conducting research in the area of air delivered heavy penetrator weapons in an effort to address shortfalls in capabilities to reach very hard and deeply buried targets, including navigation, guidance and control (NG&C) in GPS disrupted or denied environments, and weapon system integration.  In order to address the DoD requirement for high reliability, tightly controlled impact, heavy penetrator precision NG&C, AAC/XRS is taking steps to initiate risk reduction study contracts.  Research proposals aimed at investigating weapon development or modification of existing weapons in the 5000-7000 pound weight class for hard target penetration and precision guidance are of particular interest as a means of reducing overall program risk.  Study contract program objectives are as follows: 

1.	Define heavy penetrator NG&C conceptual system architecture to include potential guidance scheme, hardware components, surety, packaging and configuration, weight, size, expected performance and operating characteristics. 

2.	Define the trade space associated with designing, producing, and fielding a highly reliable, precision guided heavy penetrator weapon system.

3.	Identify and define the critical risk areas associated with system development and aircraft integration.

4.	Develop a schedule and a rough estimate of cost for system development and integration and average unit procurement price.
 

PART II 

PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS

General:  Instructions below exclude discussion of the White Paper requirement listed above, as it does not constitute a formal offer to do business.  A formal offer to do business will be solicited by a warranted United States Air Force Contracting Officer upon selection of a white paper topic of interest, or solicited as a part of an amendment to this BAA that identifies a specific technology development requirement. 

A. (1) Each proposal submitted should consist of two volumes.  Volume 1 should provide the technical proposal and Volume 2 should address the price/cost portions of the proposal.  Volume 1 is limited to a total of 15 pages, including resumes, charts, figures, tables, etc.  Pages in excess of the specified 15 pages will be removed and returned to the offeror before evaluation starts.  A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it.  Minimum print size is 10-point type, or 12 pitch.  Every proposal shall have at least one copy submitted on disk or via email, with a hard copy of the signature page sent via regular mail.  Proposals submitted electronically are to be submitted in Microsoft Word 2000 format.  Note: The preferred format for all proposals is via electronic means.  Any classified data shall be submitted in a separate annex.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals through electronic means.  To do business with the Air Armament Center, Concept and Technology Development Division (AAC/XRS), you must have software packages that are compatible with Microsoft Office 2000.

(2)  Pursuant to the requirements of FAR 19.702 and 52.219-9, if the total amount of the proposal exceeds $500,000 and there are subcontracting possibilities, offerors are to prepare and submit a subcontracting plan for Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), and Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns or Historical Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCUs/MIs) as part of their proposal submission.  (Small business offerors do not have to submit the plan.)  Offerors are cautioned that the Government will not execute a contract unless the Contracting Officer determines that the plan provides the maximum practicable opportunity for SBs, SDB, and WOSB concerns or HBCUs/MIs to participate in the performance of the contract.  Subcontracting plans which provide for less than the aforementioned goal must be accompanied by sufficient evidence that all reasonable attempts to meet the 5% goal have been made.  Acceptable plans will be included in resultant contracts.

(3)  If information contained in the proposal is in the public domain or cannot be protected under law as a trade secret (e.g., a patent application), the Air Force will not accept liability for failure to safeguard against open disclosure.  If a responder wishes to restrict the proposal, the responder should mark the title page with the following legend:

“This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, provided that if a contract is awarded to this BAA responder as a result of or in connection with the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract.  This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in the data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.  

The pages to which the above restriction applies shall be marked with the following legend:

	“Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.”

The offeror whose proposal contains no limited rights data is required to so state in order that misunderstandings may be avoided.

(4)  Offerors are required to supply the Contractor Identification Number (CIN) (FAR 4.602(d)), also known as the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number using the provision prescribed at FAR 4.603(a) for each successful offeror.  If the offeror does not have a CIN, it should contact either the cognizant administrative contracting officer or the local Dun and Bradstreet Branch Information Services office for assistance.  Prospective offerors should not delay submission of their offers pending receipt of their codes.  Offerors should indicate in their proposal submission that they are in the process of obtaining this information.

(5)  Offerors are required to register in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of any contract (DFAR 252.204-7004).  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at https://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

(6)  As a minimum, all offerors will be required to submit monthly financial and technical status reports and a final technical report.  Depending on the duration of the program, offerors may be required to prepare semiannual and/or annual interim reports.  The Government negotiator will work out an appropriate Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) with each successful offeror unless a CDRL is not appropriate.

B.  The technical portion of the proposal, Volume 1, should contain the following:
1.	A title and abstract that includes a concise Statement of Work and basic approaches to be utilized.  The Statement of Work should indicate the effort intended for each period of research.
2.	A reasonably complete discussion stating the background and objectives of the proposed work, the approaches to be considered, and the resources to be employed. Include also the nature and extent of the anticipated risks and results, and if known, the manner in which the work will contribute to the accomplishment of the agency's mission.
3.	The type of support, if any, the offeror requests of the AAC/XRS, e.g. facilities, equipment, and materials.
4.	The names of federal, state, local agencies or other parties receiving the proposals and/or funding the proposed effort of a similar nature. If none, so state.
5.	The identity of facilities, specialized equipment, or other real property to be used for the work, if appropriate for an understanding of the technical work to be conducted.
6.	Identify all on-going Government contracts and related past contracts or assistance instruments.  Provide a technical point of contact and telephone number for each contract cited.

C.  The cost portion of the proposal, Volume 2, should contain the following as applicable:

1.	Summary by cost element and profit for each contract line and sub-line item and for the total proposal.
2.	Summary of all travels by destination, purpose, number of people and days, air fare, per diem, car rental, etc.
3.	Consultants by name, rate, and number of days or hours.  Furnish copy of consulting agreement, and identify prior agreements under which the consultant received the proposed rate.
4.	Other direct costs by type, amount, cost per unit and purpose.  Specifically identify any costs for printing and publication and computers.
5.	A monthly expenditure plan and a disbursement rate report are required and may be included in the financial report.  The disbursement report must include the forecast of billings to the Government and the total cumulative amounts billed through the report month.
6.	State whether you are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business, HUBZONE small business, Veteran-owned business, nonprofit, educational, or historically black college or university.  The appropriate NAICS code is 541710 with a 500 size standard. 
7.	Anything of extra value to the program, for example, the results of internally funded research applicable to this BAA’s research objectives.
8.	Other terms and conditions, if any.

D.  Negotiation of your proposal will be accomplished through the review, discuss, concur (RDC) process via phone, video teleconferencing (VTC) or face-to-face discussions.  To facilitate this process, draft proposals must be submitted in accordance with the government’s instructions at the time your proposal is requested.

E.  Unpriced options will not be considered for award.

F.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.

G.  The general scope for a program resulting from this BAA is a limited research program, generally a feasibility study.  The program should be designed to demonstrate well defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort.  White papers/proposals for research in amounts normally up to approximately $350-400K may be submitted at any time under this BAA.

H.  Refer to the "Proprietary Information" and "When and How to Submit" sections of Air Force Material Command Unsolicited Proposal Guide, AFMC Pamphlet 64-101.  The AFMC Form 190 is not applicable to BAAs. The guide is available at the following web site:
  http://www.afmc-pub.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/PK/pkp/pkpa/unsolpub.htm

I.  Responders should reference YEC-BAA-04-0001 and contact name.  Proposals should be sent to the contracting officer specified at the time proposals are requested.  This announcement is open and effective until superceded.  Those who propose are warned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to obligate the government.

 


PART III 

PROPOSAL EVALUATION 

A.  Proposal Evaluation Criteria: 

1.  Scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, potential contributions of the effort to the AAC/XRS mission, and extent to which the study effort will contribute to overall concept development.  This includes the following two sub-factors (listed in descending order of importance):

a.  Definition of the elements of the trade space associated with heavy penetrator NG&C system architecture, including tradeoffs among potential guidance schemes, hardware components, reliability, surety, logistics, weight, size, expected performance and operating characteristics.  Identification of the critical risk areas associated with system development and aircraft integration.

b.  Soundness of the proposed process for executing trade studies to address and document critical system design issues through the appropriate mix of analysis, simulation, and utilizing empirical data on existing weapon systems.

2.  Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.

3.  Offerer’s analysis and simulation tools, techniques and experience.

4.  Price and best value to the government.

5. Additional contractual terms and conditions proposed by the offeror, if any.

B.  Upon receipt of a proposal, the AAC/XRS technical staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Air Force mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort.  Offerors whose proposals the government considers as not having sufficient scientific merit or relevance to Air Force needs, or those for which funds are not available, will be declined by written notice from the government.  Any such declination is not subject to appeal or further review.

C.  It is the policy of AAC/XRS to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  Proposals not declined as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation by highly qualified personnel from within the Government.  

D.  Each proposal will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall AAC/XRS program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.
