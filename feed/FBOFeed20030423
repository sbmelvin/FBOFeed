<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contracting Officer 7037871367     Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE SOLICITS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FOR THE STUDY ENTITLED "CHARACTERIZATION OF GULF OF MEXICO DEEPWATER HARD BOTTOM COMMUNITIES WITH EMPHASIS ON LOPHELIA CORAL", AS DESCRIBED BELOW.  INTRODUCTION:  Although the vast majority of the bottom in deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is comprised of soft sediments (mixtures of sand, silt, and clay), it is well known that there are some locations with significant areas of hard bottom, particularly associated with the tops and flanks of salt diapirs.  These hard bottom areas are generally created through biogenic precipitation of carbonate by chemosynthetic bacteria.  Resulting authigenic carbonate deposits can subsequently become exposed above surrounding slope sediments providing substantial substrate for attached animal communities to develop.  Hard bottom substrates can be colonized by diverse assemblages of megafauna in the deep sea; however, organic input, hydrographic characteristics, and other factors are believed to limit distribution of high-density, high-diversity communities.  Deepwater assemblages of scleractinian corals are a particularly significant community type in the deep sea due to their ability to create extensive additional habitat within the structure formed by the coral itself.  It is not known if these remarkable coral or habitats are common in other parts of the Gulf or if they are extremely rare.  Hard bottom areas have been observed at numerous sites on the upper GOM slope and there appear to be vast differences in the density and diversity of attached faunal communities that occur on these exposed carbonate features. A number of hypotheses explaining the heterogeneity of high density non-chemosynthetic communities have been suggested, but none have been studied to date.  To address this knowledge gap, the MMS is conducting this study.  STUDY OBJECTIVES ARE: 1) Use results from previous related work, in-house MMS seismic data, and hypotheses to define and select sampling areas that represent both known and probable areas of exposed hard bottom with associated high density communities that are not necessarily associated with active hydrocarbon seepage within specified depth ranges.  2) Design and implement submersible survey and sampling techniques that will characterize the types of non-chemosynthetic megafauna communities that live on deepwater hard substrate outcrops, and  3) Investigate and describe the environmental conditions that result in the observed distribution and development of high density communities, particularly extensive areas of Lophelia coral.  THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THIS STUDY SHALL BE THIRTY-SIX (36) MONTHS.  The field work is anticipated to occur during the first two years and the third year shall be dedicated to analyses, synthesis of results, and completion of all deliverables.  The study area is the region of the northern Gulf of Mexico continental slope between 300 and 1,000 m of depth.  THE ESTIMATED COST OF THIS STUDY IS BETWEEN $1,000,000 and $1,400,000.  THIS STUDY CONSISTS OF SIX (6) MAIN TASKS: (1) refinement of proposed hypotheses; (2) site selection; (3) coordination with USGS field work; (4) field sampling; (5) sample and data analysis; and (6) data interpretation and reporting.  IN ORDER TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform work by providing Capabilities Statements not later than 5 PM on MAY 14, 2003, detailing:  (1) Your KEY PERSONNEL, scientific and technical, (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project) with their qualifications, specific expertise, and experience.  Particularly relevant is their expertise in the fields of deep-sea biology (including field and laboratory work experience) demonstrated by qualification and authorship in peer-reviewed publications.  Information about technical personnel who will be responsible for the organization of information and the production of documents and manuscripts must be provided.

<SUBJECT>A -- SPO OFFICE-WIDE BAA
<SOLNBR>BAA03-14
<RESPDATE>041504
<ARCHDATE>04162004
<CONTACT>Joe Guerci, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-516-7360, Email none
<DESC>BAA03-14; This BAA is open and effective until 15 April 2004; POC: Dr. Joseph Guerci, DARPA/SPO Deputy Director, is the overall technical POC for this BAA, e-mail: JGuerci@DARPA.MIL.  Contact information for the SPO Program Managers (PMs) under each technical area is specified in Attachment 1.  Bidders are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant PMs directly before submitting a response to this BAA. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Special Projects Office (DARPA/SPO) researches, develops, demonstrates and transitions technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges.  SPO investments range from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems.  SPO is developing technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities, used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction.  SPO is investing in novel space technologies across the spectrum of space control applications including rapid access, space situational awareness, counterspace, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures.  Investments are being made in technologies to provide full-scale protection systems against the threat of chemical and biological attack.  SPO is also developing significantly more effective ways to counter non-RF air defenses as well as proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAV’s and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance.  SPO is initating efforts to defend against radiological weapons (so called “dirty bombs”) and is interested in concepts to defeat suicide bombers and to deal with urban threats.  In all of these areas, SPO efforts encompass the full range of activities required to develop complete prototype systems, from hardware development and characterization to algorithms, exploitation techniques, and full-scale system experimentation.  To support this range of efforts, SPO is also home to DARPA’s expertise in the areas of advanced sensor systems and guidance and navigation technologies.  Proposed efforts may address the development of prototype components, or systems; studies and modeling of existing or proposed systems; and data collections that will overcome deficiencies in existing data.  Attachment 1 provides additional information and POCs for these areas of interest; bidders are encouraged to contact these POCs before submitting a response to this BAA.  This information is provided to focus interest on innovative concepts that contribute to ongoing SPO investments, but is not meant to preclude white papers on other research efforts.  PROGRAM SCOPE: Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY 03 and may occur at any time through the closing date as funds are available.  White papers and proposals determined to not be of interest under this BAA will not be considered if resubmitted unless significant changes in the approach or new technical information becomes available.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 months or $1M, although exceptions are possible; in addition, follow-on work may result in further funding for an extended period of performance.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  GENERAL INFORMATION: SPO is accepting white papers in response to this BAA.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offerer whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. To further reduce burden, it is suggested that the offerer directly contact the cognizant PM by email (preferably) or telephone to quickly assess suitability under this BAA. For those submitting white papers, a SPO Program Manager most closely related to the submitted topic will review white papers and provide a written response to the offerer within 30 days.  Those offerers whose white papers are found to be of interest and consistent with the intent of this BAA will be encouraged to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such encouragement does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award.   Those offerers whose white papers are not found to be of interest to the cognizant Program Manager will be provided feedback regarding why their proposal is not of interest.  This does not preclude the offerer from still submitting a full proposal.  All awards will be subject to availability of government funds.  Awards will be made to those offerers whose proposals are considered most advantageous to the government.  The government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or minority institutions (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete severable areas of research for exclusive competition among the entries.  DARPA/SPO will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the bidder believes the work, if successful, would merit classification.  Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you chose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA. The point of contact for classified responses is Mr. Frank Purdy, DARPA/SPO, and he can be reached at 703-812-1992.  Bidders who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their proposal should contact this POC before submitting a response.  Those offerers submitting white papers are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offerer is a large, small, woman-owned, small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution.  The white paper should follow the same general format as described for Volume I under PROPOSAL FORMAT but include only Section I and II A and D.  Section I: Administrative, including Cost Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM). Section II: Summary of Proposal: A. Innovative claims for the proposed research; B. Technical rationale, technical approach and constructive plan.  Each cost proposal shall contain a section addressing the following: Awards made under this initiative are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerers and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offerer supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  If the offerer believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.  Only those offerers whose proposal is expected to result in contract award will be required to submit a completed and signed copy of “Representations, Certifications, and other Statements by Offerers or Respondents”.  This document is not required for the submission of a proposal unless specifically requested. Offerers are notified that this document is frequently updated and any offerer selected for award may be requested to submit an updated “Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements by Offerers or Respondents.” White Paper format and complete instructions for proposal preparation can be found at Attachment 2.  EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit;  b) Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/SPO Mission; c) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition; d) Offerer’s Capabilities and Related Experience; e) Cost Realism. The criteria used to evaluate proposals will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government.  Only (a) and (b) above will apply to white papers.  SUBMISSION INFORMATION:
The administrative addresses for this BAA are: Fax:  (703) 516-7360 (Addressed to: DARPA/SPO, BAA 03-14), Electronic Mail:  BAA02-10@darpa.mil, Mail: DARPA/SPO, ATTN: BAA 03-14, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714. This announcement and Attachments 1 and 2 may be retrieved via the WWW at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ in the solicitations area. Offerers are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number and an e-mail address. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  Offerers are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

The request for quotat ion will be issued and available for download at ://www.lewis.army.mil/doc. The anticipated issue date of the solicitation is 29 April 2003. Overview of Function: Main Post Chapel’s primary function is to host worship services.  The worship style is Traditional in nature using a pipe organ, or piano and keyboard, an occasional acoustic guitar or flute, and small choir.  The service does not rel y on sound reinforcement, though it is necessary.  No monitors are currently used.  The chapel holds approximately 300 people. Overview of the Acoustic Environment: The long rectangular room has parallel surfaces side to side and front to back although the back is broken up by a balcony/organ loft.  The ceiling is quite high and peaked and runs longitudinally down the center.  The  ceiling is supported by large, arching beams beginning at the floor.  The front (stage) wall and side stage walls are composed of plaster.   The stage rear has a large compliment of organ pipes.  A large stained glass window sits center stage rear.  Two r ows of pews flank the room left and right of the center isle.  The sound control area is located in the balcony. Function within the Acoustic Environment: Main Post Chapel is the oldest chapel being examined and historic in nature.  It is well suited for its current functions.  Sound system updating is needed.   Although the stage area is reflective, it is congruent with function.  The choir area could make use of minor absorption of mid/high frequencies when the choir performs with the piano and keyboard.  Otherwise, treatment is unnecessary.The balcony poses the  greatest acoustic detriment to this room: 1.	The balcony fascia is flat and reflective.  Frequencies from 800Hz to 5kHz reflect in a direct line to a seating area beginning approximately three rows in front of the balcony and toward the front for about six rows. 2.	The seating under the balcony is in a radically different acoustic space.  Because of the low flat ceiling, near field side walls, and hard surfaces, a perfect resonant chamber is formed.  The people seated in this area will feel isolated from the rest of the congregation because, in fact, acoustically they are.     Overview of Remedies: Because of the historical nature of this chapel, treatments described elsewhere are not suitable in this room.  It is imperative that the acoustic treatment selected for Main Post Chapel not alter the basic look of the room and fit  discreetly into the existing décor. To this end we have, we have selected New Dimensions.  This 2” thick product has the look of finished wall board while providing an effective acoustic solution for the Main Post problems.  A factory representative is required to measure, order, and install  this product.  This approach insures a textural match and seamless fit.  A color sample of the existing paint must be matched.  The special paint to be should be acoustically porous.

<SUBJECT>R--In-country Operations Support for The BN-350 Long Term Spent Fuel Storage Project
<SOLNBR>DE-RP03-03SF22732
<CONTACT>Stephen Law, Contracting Officer, 510-637-1906, stephen.law@oak.doe.gov;Nicholas Jackson, Contract Specialist, 510-637-1995, nicholas.jackson@oak.doe.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The United States of America has entered into an Agreement with the Republic of Kazakhstan concerning the long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel from the Kazak BN-350 Fast Breeder Nuclear Reactor.  In 1998, as part of that work, the US Department of Energy began consolidating this fuel into storage canisters.  That work was completed in 2001.  The National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA) and KATEP of RK recently completed a joint feasibility study of using metal-concrete dual use transportation and storage casks for this program.  Each cask weights approximately 120 tons loaded; the overall cask dimensions are approximately 17 feet tall and 8 feet in diameter. The recommendation of the Joint Feasibility Study has been accepted by both governments, and the initial project meeting was held in February 2003. The Project will involve removing the canisters from their current location in the storage pool at the MAEC plant, and loading them into the dual use casks, followed by the transfer of the casks from the BN-350 site across Kazakhstan to Baikal 1 for long term storage at an independent spent fuel storage installation which will be expanded as part of this project. CURRENT REQUIREMENT:  NNSA will issue an RFP on or about May 12, 2003, which will request proposals from qualified vendors for in-country operations support during the planning, design and implementation phases of this work.  In general, the  Contractor will be responsible for working with the US Project team and the appropriate Kazakstani organizations to assure that the planning and performing of in-country functions are done safely, technically correct, on schedule and at a fair and reasonable expense to the US Government. Specific tasks under the Statement of Work will include providing technical direction and oversight during: (1)  Prepartion and review of detailed procedures for canister and cask handling processes, including but not limited to radiation protection, criticality and safeguards related processes; (2)  Procuring miscellaneous supplies, tools and equipment in the US and Kazakhstan; (3)  Training and qualifying local labor; (4)  Setup, including preoperational testing of some specialized equipment; (5)  Monitoring the progress of the work and meeting regularly with Kazakstani management to resolve any difficulties; (6)  Monitoring and auditing Kazakhstani level of effort as may be needed to process invoices and payments to Kazakhstani organizations. In the evaluation of proposals, NNSA will consider the Offeror's experience and qualifications in the following areas: (1)  Rigging and handling spent nuclear fuel transportation and storage casks. (2)  Transporting spent fuel (3)  Nuclear fuel radiological safety (4)  Nuclear fuel criticality safety (5)  IAEA Safeguards Requirements (6)  Physical Security Requirements (7)  Performing work in compliance with nuclear licensing requirements. (8)  Training, qualification and monitoring  foreign nationals to perform work safely and in compliance with nuclear licensing requirements. (9)   Operating in Kazakhstan or countries with a similar infrastructure, including but not limited to the physical, retail, commercial and political infrastructures. The RFP will be issued using full and open competition, and all qualified vendors are invited to submit proposals.  It is anticipated that a Cost-Reimbursement plus Award Fee type contract will be awarded. Any questions regarding this synopsis or RFP should be submitted by using the "submit question" option on DOE's Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) website.

Offerors or Quoters shall submit initial price proposals or quotes along with all other required documentation to FISC San Diego Regional Contracting Department as described herein. Upon submission of their proposal or quote, Offerors or Quoters must complete the registration process by following the procedures and guidelines established by Procuri.com at http://www.govauctions.procuri.com. The DP E shall not be delayed because an Offeror or Quoter fails to complete the registration process prior to the starting time on the date of the DPE. 2. Offer/Quote Evaluation. After initial offers or quotes are evaluated as described in the Evaluation of Offers provisions of this solicitation, the Contracting Officer may proceed with the DPE process. However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award upon initial price proposals or quotes and, therefore, may elect not to conduct the DPE. 3. Notification and Training. Prior t o the DPE, FISC San Diego will notify each qualifying Offeror or Quoter that they have been selected to participate in the DPE. FISC San Diego or Procuri.com will provide training on the Dynamic Pricing Event process and the details pertaining to this solicitation DPE. Written information not contained or attached to this solicitation that concerns t he Dynamic Pricing Event may be provided to each participating offeror or quoter as part of their training. 4. Procuri.com and Government Trainer Interaction with Offerors. Offeror or Quoter interaction with Procuri.com and FISC San Diego personnel during the registration and training process is for the sole purpose of facilitating the DPE. Such communication shall not be considered discussions with the Offerors or Quoters within the meaning set forth in FAR Part 15. C. DURING THE DPE 1. Discussions. The DPE shall be considered the opening of discussions as defined at FAR Part 15.306(d). Offerors or Quoters may, but are not required to, revise their initial pricing proposal or quotation during the DPE. Revised price offers or quotes shall be electronically submitted by Offerors or Quoters during the DPE. Offerors or Quoters shall not submit revised pricing via any other mechani sm including (but not limited to) post, courier, fax, e-mail, or orally unless specifically authorized by t he Contracting Officer (see paragraph D for further details). 2. DPE Connection. The invited Offerors or Quoters shall be provided the opportunity to connect to the Procuri.com website (www.govauctions.procuri.com) via Internet connection. Offerors or Quoters will register for the scheduled event using the Procuri.com software solution. Offerors or Quoters shall be responsible for providing their own computer system and connecting to the telecommunications service used for each DPE via their own Internet Service Provider (ISP). 3. Time Period. The DPE will be conducted for a period of 60 minutes. If an offer or quote is submitted within the last 5 minutes of the time period, the DPE period shall be extended for an additional 5 minutes, if the offer/quote is the lowest pri ce received. The time shall be extended for an unlimited number of 5 minute extension periods, if a lower offer/quote is submitted within the last 5 minutes. The final price revision submitted during the DPE will be considered the Offerors Final Price Proposal (see D.1 below for additional information). 4. Problems. Any offeror having problems during a DPE must notify the Contracting Office at FISC San Diego immediately. A problem is an event that interferes with the Offerors ability to participate in the DPE and includes, but is not limited to, Internet connection and re-connection difficulties, (2) software or hardware failures, and (3) erroneous data entry errors. Offerors will have 10 minutes after the DPE goes into the Quiet Period status to notify the Contracting Office of any problems. The names and phone numbers of the FISC San Diego employees who will be available for  assistance during the DPE will be provided to each invited offeror prior to the starting time and date of th e event. If the Contracting Officer judges that any offeror is disadvantaged by the identified problem, Procuri.com and FISC San Diego may, at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, correct the problem, pause and may reopen the DPE, or cancel the DPE. D. AFTER THE DPE 1. Closing Price Discussions. Discussions concerning price shall normally conclude at the close of the DPE. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2. No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offe ror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynami c Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation. 3. Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system. End of Clauses/Provisions.

<SUBJECT>Z--Remove Logging Roads at Redwood National Park
<SOLNBR>N8485030006
<ARCHDATE>04222004
<CONTACT>Rod Roberson Contract Specialist 70746461015040 Rod_Roberson@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service seeks proposals for logging road removal at Redwood National Park, located in Humboldt and Del Norte counties, California.  Redwood National Park is removing roads, landings and skid roads to reduce future erosion and restore natural landforms and watershed systems. This contract involves excavating road fill from stream channels, pulling back side-cast road fill, decompacting roads, retrieving and burying debris from logging and other activities (culverts, cable, concrete foundations, etc.), and restoring the natural configuration of the land (ridges, stream valleys and swales). Trees and logs encountered during excavations will be spread over finished surfaces. The finished surfaces of all areas disturbed by the equipment shall be left in a manner suitable for transplanting, re-establishment of native vegetation and trail construction. Reconstruction of failed sections of road is often necessary in order to access the road removal work sites. The ultimate goal of the work is to restore the national and state park lands to a condition similar to what would have existed without disturbance by humans. The earth moving work that is required in this contract is the critical foundation of this restoration effort.  Stream crossings will be excavated to original width, depth, and slope to expose natural channel armor and buried topsoil. Removal of roads and skid roads will include retrieval of fill material displaced during road construction. Sidecast fill material will be excavated along road benches to expose buried topsoil. Excavated material will be moved to stable locations, placed against cutbanks, and shaped to blend with the surrounding topography above and below the road to re-create the landforms that existed prior to road construction. Occasionally, excavated material may need to be end-hauled to more distant fillsites.  The size of excavations associated with this work can range from less than one hundred cubic yards to tens of thousands of cubic yards in volume. The moisture content and type of material to be excavated can vary significantly from one work site to another. Ground conditions and material to be excavated can vary from dry to completely saturated. The type of material to be excavated can vary from fine-grained soil material to large concentrations and quantities of rock, boulders, rootwads, and sections of old growth trees. These variations in excavated material and ground conditions are inherent to the nature of this work.  The terrain in the project area is steep, irregular, and vegetated with 25 to 50 year old second growth and old growth redwood forest. The nature of the work will require equipment to be used on steep terrain and in difficult working conditions. Equipment will be required to push fill material up steep inclines as well as shape and finish steep slopes. This will require the equipment to traverse, move around, and sit on steep slopes while performing the work. Access to some work sites, or portions of work sites, will require operator skill and dexterity to minimize access impacts over steep irregular ground. Large quantities of vegetation will be removed before and during excavation, stockpiled, then spread over finished surfaces.   Operator planning and forethought will be necessary to manage vegetation and excavated material efficiently.  Contractors and equipment operators must be able to accurately interpret written and verbal excavation details. They must be able to visualize and plan all aspects of work required at each site to ensure that access is not cut off inadvertently or prematurely. Skill in operation and coordination of heavy equipment is necessary to ensure cost-effective restoration.   Adverse impacts to park resources (e.g. old growth trees, natural ground surface, water quality, vegetation, wildlife habitat, etc.) must be minimized in accomplishing the required work.  The NAICS code is 238910, and the applicable size standard for this project is $12 million. This is a one-year indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract. The magnitude of the overall project is estimated to be between $500,000 to $1,000,000. The Government may elect to award a single contract or multiple task order contracts to one or more sources.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued. This procurement is unrestricted; all responsible sources may submit a proposal.  Issuance of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected to be on or about May 27, 2003 with proposals due thirty (30) days thereafter. Interested parties may download the solicitation from www.fedbizopps.gov or directly from the DOI  National Business Center website at www.ideasec.nbc.gov.  Hardcopies of this solicitation will not be available.  The participation of small business concerns in this acquisition is encouraged.

<SOLNBR>PR-CI-03-10585
<CONTACT>EMILY I. MARCIL, Contract Specialist, Phone: (513) 487-2031, E-Mail: marcil.emily@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 procedures, the EPA intends to procure one (1) Medium Duty Four Wheel Drive Dynamometer for Office of Air and Radiation/Laboratory Operations Division.  The four wheel drive electric chassis dynamometer will be located in a newly-developed test site at the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, MI.  As a part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, federal regulations for exhaust emissions and fuel economy of motor vehicles specify tests using chassis dynamometers to duplicate the forces encountered by a vehicle moving on a road by modeling those characteristics with a stationary vehicle on a rotating surface.  The new dynamometer will provide EPA with additional testing capabilities to support both current and future regulations as well as a range of evaluation and development activities. 	This dynamometer will be used to test a wide range of vehicles including front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, four wheel drive and all wheel drive with the full range of powertrain technology including those providing energy conservation through regenerative braking.  These vehicles will include those powered by some combination of internal combustion engines, electric motors and storage devices, hydraulics and hydraulic storage systems and fuel cells.  	 In general the dynamometer shall incorporate the following general features for testing these vehicles: accurate and precise road load determination and simulation; vehicle loading applied to the tires by 48" diameter rolls connected to intermediate motor/absorbers on a per axle configuration that contacts each vehicle tire; capability of testing all light duty vehicles, medium-duty passenger vehicles and  complete heavy duty vehicles up to 14,000 GVW, in two wheel drive and four wheel drive configurations, in a weight range of 1,000 to 14,000 pounds; roll sets which operate with synchronous speeds; operation under various ambient conditions.      	The intended test site at NVFEL is a new facility intended to provide a wide range of test capabilities.  The room's nominal measurements are 25'W x 75'L x 24'H with a clear height of 20' to the bottom of the 4' girder trusses.  This room will contain a dynamometer pit that has inside dimensions of 15' W x 55' L x 9' D located about 10 feet from each end.  This pit contains a thick reinforced floor capable of supporting the dynamometer  machinery. Adjacent is a 20' x 25' x 10' control room that will have a concrete structural deck surface for equipment. Construction of this new test facility began on April 2, 2003 with a projected completion date of January, 2004. 	The EPA is seeking to purchase a dynamometer system that will perform and collect data at the highest precision and accuracy with a high level of certainty, in a manner that can be comprehensively demonstrated and documented.  All equipment and all functions performed by the dynamometer system must be in accordance with the vehicle emissions testing and fuel economy-testing requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations.   The successful contractor shall also abide and comply with all building and safety codes specified in the EPA Facility Manual and by ASME, AISC, NEC, OSHA, BOCA, and NFPA wherever they apply.  	This procurement will be made using  "Best Value" evaluation criteria through Full and Open Competition for all elements of the Statement of Work.  The solicitation should be issued by May 13, 2003 at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  A "DRAFT" of the proposed Statement of Work for this requirement can be found at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  Interested parties are invited to review the "DRAFT" SOW and provide any comments or request a copy of the solicitation in writing to Emily Marcil at the above address, by fax at (513) 487-2107, or by e-mail at Marcil.Emily@epa.gov. by May 6, 2003. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  EPA anticipates award of the contract by July 15, 2003.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Andor Technology, of South Windsor, Connecticut for one (1) each: Deep Depletion Charge Coupled Device (CCD) Camera Detector System, System Controller card, Software Developers Kit, and External Power Supply.  The CCD Detector System will be used by NIST’s Process Measurements Division (PMD) to detect Raman scattered radiation from compound semiconductors and other weakly scattering materials.  The detection of weak Raman scattered radiation is critical for the measurement of materials properties of importance to PMD research.

***Sole Source determination is based on the need for the CCD Camera System sensors to have enhanced (relative to non-deep depletion CCD sensors) spectral response in the 700 nm to 1100 nm wavelength range and to have etalon fringe pattern suppression performed during sensor fabrication.  It is essential that the fringe suppression be performed during chip fabrication in order to assure maximum uniformity of etalon fringe pattern suppression over the entire chip.  It is imperative to NIST’s research to be able to detect weak Raman signals that could masked by non-uniform fringe patterns.  Andor Technology is the only known vendor who can supply a CCD camera system that performs etalon fringe suppression during chip fabrication.
 
***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 60 days after receipt of order.

***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by May 7, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>2400 Rolls of CCN Labels for Defense Distribution Depot San Joaquin CA (DDJC), Tracy, CA in accordance with the following statement of work:

STATEMENT OF WORK
CARTON CONTROL NUMBER (CCN) LABELS
DEFENSE DISTRIBUTION DEPOT SAN JOAQUIN
April 23, 2003
1.  Paper:  Label shall be standard white paper.  There is no requirement for a special top coat, since labels that cause excessive sheen are not accurately read by a barcode scanner.

2.  Adhesive:  Label adhesive shall be bend and peel type with commercial adhesive able to withstand dust and rough cartons.  Label liners are peeled off by hand.  Labels will be used to track internal routing of cartons within distribution warehouses, and will no longer be needed once the load is picked up by the carrier.  Once peeled, labels will have an operational life of approximately two weeks, but unused labels on liners may be retained in storage for several months.

3.  Environmental Conditions:  Labels are exposed to cold and hot temperatures experienced inside warehouse facilities located in the Northern California Central Valley (Stockton area).  Labels will not be exposed to caustic fumes.

4.  Size and Configuration:  Sample drawings are available upon request.  Label size shall be 3 inches by 5 inches.  Label barcode shall be printed, left to right, across the 5 inch side of the label.  Distance between each label on the roll shall be approximately 1/8 inch.  Label liner shall extend beyond 5 inch side on both sides and shall represent the edge of the roll.  Label corners can be squared or rounded.

5.  Roll:  Label roll shall contain 1,000 labels.  Label roll shall contain a hollow fiberboard center core of 1/8 inch thickness and hollow space of 3 inches.  The label roll is installed on a horizontal metal bar or core clamp, and the operator pulls the sheet of labels down, with the labels facing the operator on the outside facing of the roll.

6.  Printing Requirements:  Each label shall contain the acronym “CCN”.  Each label shall contain a barcode, black ink, linear, low density imprinted 3 of 9 spacing, 30 mil narrow bar printed in a 2.5 to 1 ratio.  Barcode width from first to last line shall be less than 3 inches in length.  Control numbers shall be printed in both horizontal and vertical configurations on each label.

7.  Scanning:  Barcode readers, utilized by the Government to scan labels, include the following equipment:  handheld Intermec 1545, handheld Intermec 1550, and an overhead Metrologic Holotrack 158500.

8.  Control Numbers:  Control numbers shall contain seven alphanumeric characters.  The first digit shall be restricted to vowels, and the remaining digits shall be alphanumeric consonants and numbers (no vowels).  The sequential order for each consecutive control number shall be equivalent to a 31 number system, using alphanumeric digits ranging from B through Z, and 0 through 9 inclusive.  For example, the control number ABDF43G is followed by ABDF43H, then ABDF43J.  The control number UR8PGL8 is followed by UR8PGL9, then UR8PGMB.  The Government will provide the control numbers.  Control numbers are unique and cannot be printed more than once.  Control numbers, provided by the Government, are grouped into star-end pairs of 50,000 numbers.  There is no special reason for this grouping, since the Government is not able to systematically generate a single start-end pair for 2,400,000 control numbers.

9.  Delivery Requirement:  Contractor shall deliver 400,000 labels per month.  This equates to 400 rolls at 1,000 labels per roll for six months.  Contractor shall deliver a test roll prior to Notice to Proceed.

10.  Samples and Numbering Sequences:  Available upon request from Linda Klinedinst, Contract Specialist, by fax at 717-770-5689 or by email at Linda.klinedinst@dla.mil.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; NO WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED.  QUOTATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 3 P.M. EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME MAY 7, 2003.  QUOTATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY MAIL, FAX, OR EMAIL AND SHOULD INCLUDE PRICE PER ROLL AND DELIVERY TIME.  QUOTATIONS MAY BE MAILED TO DEFENSE DISTRIBUTION CENTER PROCUREMENT OFFICE, DDC CSS-A, BUILDING 81, ATTN:  LINDA KLINEDINST, 2001 MISSION DRIVE, NEW CUMBERLAND, PA  17070-5001; OR FAXED TO 717-770-7591/5689; OR EMAILED TO linda.klinedinst@dla.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small businesses to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM) for Information Technology (IT) projects designed to boost the Trade Capacity Building (TCB) efforts of Guatemala.

The Contractor would have three goals: 1) to survey the IT capabilities of the Guatemalan government to increase trade efficiency, with the goal of identifying potential USTDA activities; 2) to perform standard due diligence on any projects identified; and 3) to assist the USTDA in coordinating four other IT TCB definitional missions related to the ongoing Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) negotiations.

The Contractor will be required to have experts in the information technology sector, as well as a generalist capable of coordinating the efforts of different Contractors engaged in similar activities in other Central American countries.  They would be asked to focus on the development of Terms of Reference (TOR) for projects in Guatemala, propose budgets, explore options for financing the projects, evaluate the potential for U.S. exports, examine any potential environmental impacts, and analyze the possible impact on U.S. labor.
It will be critical that the Contractor work with Guatemalan government officials, personnel at the US Embassy in Guatemala City, and appropriate representatives of public and private sector organizations involved in increasing trade capacity through IT modernization in Guatemala.

In addition to identifying these potential USTDA projects, the Contractor will assist USTDA in coordinating four other IT TCB definitional missions related to the ongoing Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) negotiations. This will involve oversight of the other trade-related IT definitional missions in the Central American region, particularly providing guidance and reviewing mission results.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA This amendment is issued to clarify information included in the sources sought notice posted on 24 March 2003 entitled “Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for Purchase of Office Products.”  Vendors and interested parties who have already submitted a respon se need not provide additional information, unless so desired. The purpose of the notice is to request vendor feedback on a number of issues that impact both current BPA vendors and customers.  The information received from vendors and interested parties, in conjunction with other market research efforts, will be used  to address and plan corrective actions for concerns identified in the current BPAs.  Feedback will also be used to develop acquisition strategy for the possible issuance of additional BPAs. The notice is intended only as a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  Offers are not requested and will not be accepted at this time.  While vendor response to the notice is an indication of interest in future opportunities, it does not assure consideration for the a ward of additional BPAs.  If and when offers for additional BPAs are requested, a new notice will be posted. An erroneous NAICS code was provided in the original notice.  The correct NAICS code is 453210 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The deadline for submissions in response to this notice is hereby extended from 25 April 2003 to 9 May 2003.  Please submit written responses to Ms. Lynn Worsham at the Army Contracting Agency, Southern Region Headquarters, Lynn.Worsham@forscom.army.mil.  Following is a summary of the issues for which feedback is sought: 1.  Use of DOD E-Mall.  To the maximum extent possible, orders are required to be processed through the DoD E-Mall to the BPA holder.  What concerns or suggestions do you have regarding use of the E-Mall?    2.  Delivery.   Currently, the BPAs require 24-hour delivery. Would you be able to provide 24-hour delivery anywhere within the United States or only in certain geographical locations?   What price increase would be imposed for deliveries to be delivered i n 24 hours versus 72 hours?  What is your standard delivery time for popular high volume supplies?  What is your standard delivery time for unpopular low volume supplies?   3.  Minimum Orders.  Do you require a minimum order?  If yes, what is your minimum order?   4.  Charges to Customer Purchase Card.   A) Level 3 data.  Level 3 data is defined as an electronic posting to the cardholder’s billing statement simultaneously when the items are scanned and charged to the customer’s credit card.   Do you have the capabil ity of transmitting Level 3 data?  B) Charges for complete order.  Do you have the capability to charge for total orders versus partial shipments with partial charges, even when shipments from various distribution sites are made to one delivery point for o ne order?  If no, please explain why.  5.  Pricing and Discounts. The Army’s objective is to achieve the best commercial pricing possible for customers using combined Army purchasing power.  In addition to discounts off the GSA schedule pricing, volume discounts will become effective as the tot al dollar volume ordered under an individual BPA reaches certain thresholds.  Volume discounts would remain in effect for the life of the BPA and potentially for follow-on BPAs.  Do you have any concerns, advice or experience on a discount system that will  work to obtain total dollar volume discounts?     6.  Pre-priced items. The Army is considering the potential benefits of pre-pricing some of the most popular high volume office products.   What advantages/disadvantages do you think pre-priced items would create?   7.  Javits-Wagner O’Day (JWOD) Act Compliance.  Are you an authorized JWOD distributor? Do you have a system in place to substitute commercial products with JWOD products if the customer orders a commercial item number?  Are there pricing or delivery issue s with JWOD products that should be raised to the JWOD c ommittee?   8.  Potential Awards to Teams or Business Consortia.  Vendors may consider teaming and consortium arrangements to maximize both business opportunities and customer support.  However, in establishing the contractual relationships among vendors on a team or in a consortium, small business vendors may wish to consider the potential impact to their small business size status and implications regarding control of their business, in light of FAR 19.101 and SBA regulatory definitions pertaining to affiliation for the purpose of assessing a company’s small business status.

<DESC>Description:  Questions Received and Answers provided concerning this procurement.
1.	Is there an incumbent? There is no incumbent.

2.	The NAICS size standard is $6.0M, does it mean that the bidder is under $6.0M size standard only?  Is this a full and open competition?  Would any consideration be given to making this a Small Business Set-Aside?  Perhaps a couple of small companies teaming together?  This procurement is unrestricted and the NAICS was included for informational purposes.

3.	What is the Government estimate?   What budget has been in place in the past for these services?   There has been no specific budget for these services.  The original estimate was well under $100,000.  As a result of revising the requirement to add an additional performance period of 30 days the estimate is still under $100,000.  A new Optional CLIN 0004 for an implementation process plan and assistance, is being added by Amendment, however, funds are not now available for this effort and exercise of Option CLIN 0004 is subject to funds becoming available.  If Option CLIN 0004 is exercised, performance would be after the initial 90 day performance period for CLINS 0001 through 0003.  Option CLIN 0004 is not included in the Government Estimate.  Travel will become CLIN 0005 with a not to exceed price ceiling of $10,000.  Two trips to DCMA HQ are anticipated and all travel during performance will be approved in advance and reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation.

4.	Given that the CLIN 0002 deliverable’s depth and breadth is dependent upon CLIN 0001 results, is there an alternative timeframe for submitting the CLIN 0002 deliverable?  If so, what is the timeframe?  Why is the period of performance limited to 60 days, we estimate it would take at least six months to complete with a high level of quality and thoroughness.   DCMA will revise the performance period to make CLIN 0001 deliverable and mid performance review due 45 calendar days after contract award and CLIN 0002 and 0003 to be due 90 calendar days after contract award.  Option CLIN 0004 performance period will be determined by the successful offeror’s proposal and whether funds become available for its exercise.

5.	Is a more detailed solicitation available? Is there an official RFP?  Is there a full Statement of Work available for Solicitation Number: DCMA01-03-Q-0003, Customer Relations Management Overview?  Or is the solicitation posted on FedBizzOpps the complete Statement of Work?  The combined synopsis solicitation is the official RFP.  The combined synopsis and solicitation as well as any amendments posted on www.eps.gov constitute the complete solicitation.  The combined synopsis solicitation is the only document available.  

6.	When will a list of interested vendors be available?  There is no plan to publish such a list.  

7.	May we submit a proposal for a portion of the SOW? Is DCMA willing to split the RFQ and award individual CLINS?  Offers are requested for the full requirement as it is anticipated that only one purchase order or delivery order will be issued for the entire requirement.

8.	Does DCMA anticipate using a contractor to expand on the results of this initial work and support the implementation of CRM?  Option CLIN 0004 has been added for implementation support should funds become available.  No other procurements are anticipated.

9.	Does DCMA anticipate developing a software solution for CRM?  Unknown at this time as industry proposals may or may not recommend use of a software tool.  Cost of any software tool referred to in offerors proposals should be  priced in the offer with supporting cost documentation. 

10.	Travel:  Customer Base Paragraph IV represents DCMA customers worldwide, but no mention is made regarding travel to customer sites.  Should travel plans be included as part of a response, and if not, what arrangements will DCMA make to provide information on the customer base?  The solicitation, Paragraph IX, indicates that the services will be performed at the contractor’s facility with visits to DCMA HQ.  However, directions for preparing the price proposal asks for all anticipated travel, destinations, purpose of travel and associated costs.  Could you clarify the extent to which you anticipate travel requirements outside the D.C. Metropolitan area?  If you can, specify the key field offices locally and overseas to price travel more or less correctly.  How many sites does the contractor need to visit?   Travel is CLIN 0005 with a not to exceed price ceiling of $10,000.  Two trips to DCMA HQ are anticipated and all travel during performance will be approved in advance and reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation.  No overseas travel is anticipated.  Proposals may indicate any other travel the offeror feels would be germane to this effort. The Customer Base was described in Paragraph VI. 

11.	How do I send my proposal by email, fax, or mail, Fedex?  Proposals should not be submitted by email.  Use regular mail or Fedex or any other means in order to deliver an original signature by paper as required by clause FAR 52.212-1.  In addition to the paper submission, provide the MS PowerPoint technical presentation by CD or diskette in your proposal submission.  Proposals must be received by the specified time, currently May 2 at 4:00 p.m. local time.

12.	Based on our prior experience in conducting similar initiatives, 60 days represents an extremely aggressive schedule for completion of the stipulated level of assessment and analysis tasks. Are there other constraints or requirements that impact the stated performance period? In that regard, can you confirm that the period of performance is 60 calendar days rather than 60 working days?  The revised period of performance for CLINS 0001 through 0003 is 90 calendar days.  Known constraints are funding levels available for this effort and internal milestones for completing the project. 

13.	Proposal preparation instructions indicate that proposed prices and Key Personnel resumes may be provided as separate documents. Also, the proposal preparation instructions call for the inclusion of Corporate Past Performance information. Can you confirm that the Key Personnel resumes are not included in the 25 slide limitation?  Secondly, can you confirm that the Corporate Past Performance information should be included as a separate document and is not to be included in the 25 slide limitation? Are all associated representations and certifications considered to be separate and excluded from the 25 slide limitation?   Key Personnel resumes, pricing information, Corporate Past Performance and contractor certifications and representations are requested to be provided separately from the 25 page slide presentation.  The 25 page limit includes the cover page.   Offerors may, however, include any information they wish in the 25 page slide presentation.  Refer to the original synopsis solicitation for evaluation criteria for the 25 page slide presentation as well as the other parts of the offer.

14.	The solicitation requires that one outcome include a "fully integrated DCMA marketing program spanning the customer base". The term "marketing program" could be interpreted in several ways. Can you provide an explanation of what a "marketing program" might be considered to include? Is there an existing plan and would this document be available? What is the definition and expectation for the integrated marketing plan?  There is too little direction in the RFQ to feel we know what the focus is and as stated, it pretty much covers the waterfront.   DCMA wants to be able to convey to its customers our capabilities and have the customers understand who we are and what we offer.  The intended outcome is to improve customer relations and customer satisfaction.  There is no existing marketing plan.

15.	Does the scope of this work include the International District and from DCMA's perspective are there any unique considerations that should be applied to an international scope?  DCMA seeks industry expertise on the full scope of DCMA effort including International.

16.	Would performance create an Organizational Conflict of Interest for the successful offeror for future CRM work beyond this contract?  We are mitigating any organizational conflict of interest by adding Optional CLIN 0004.  DCMA expects offers from industry leaders who should be able to submit and price a proposed implementation process plan.  DCMA does not anticipate any future procurement for this requirement beyond the current RFQ.

17.	Do we need to get on a bidders list or can we just submit a proposal by the due date?  If there are any amendments to the RFQ, can you please send them to me? There is no bidders list as all notices including amendments will be posted on www.eps.gov

18.	Evaluation factors in Power Point format as well as two paper copies will be limited to 25 pages?  Please clarify.  Evaluation factors are the criteria that will be used to evaluate offers.  Your technical proposal should be limited to 25 MS PowerPoint slide presentation.

19.	Is the contract term only 60 days?  If so, what follow up plans are in place to ensure success of the installation?  Would there be an opportunity for follow on activity?  The performance period is revised as discussed above.  Optional CLIN 0004 has been added to provide an opportunity to propose an implementation plan and assistance.  Funds are not currently available and CLIN 0004 will only be exercised should funding be made available. There are no plans for any follow on procurement.

20.	Will the transformation of the DCMA's management and operating procedures, policies and processes be complete by the time that the Customer Relations Management Overview (CRMO) is initiated?  Unknown but expected to be ongoing through out the period of performance.

21.	How will the CRMO be managed afterwards?  Agency CRM efforts will be ongoing.

22.	We understand all of the following 5 deliverable are to be provided within 60 days of contract award. Is that correct?  (1)  An assessment of the adequacy of DCMA's customer outreach and customer satisfaction measurement practices (2) A comparison of DCMA's current customer relationship practices with best practices (3) The process(es) for collecting, storing and using customer information at 3 DCMA org levels  (4) The process for measuring and managing DCMA's performance against known customer expectations (5) A fully integrated marketing program.  If yes, is the expectation, then, that DCMA would receive an off-the shelf (canned) response for deliverable #5?  The required performance outcomes are stated in Paragraph VI, however, the performance period has been extended to 90 calendar days discussed above.  Offerors should propose their best solution.  See discussion above for Optional CLIN 0004.

29.	Most of the deliverables requested are primarily concerned with the capture of customer expectations and measurement of satisfaction. The integrated marketing program should properly be developed only upon completion of the first deliverables unless it is DCMA's desire to develop a marketing program independent of known customer priorities. Does DCMA want the marketing program to capitalize on customer insights gained through creation of the first deliverables?  If the answer is "yes", then we assume a solution that is customized to the specific business, mission and organizational structure of DCMA is desired. Will DCMA allow for the timetable to be extended to enable that to occur?   DCMA requests proposals to meet stated requirements at the offerors discretion.   DCMA has extended the performance period to 45 calendar days for CLINS 0001 and mid performance review and extended the performance period for CLINS 0002 and 0003 to 90 calendar days from date of award and has added optional CLIN 0004.  

30.	Is the deliverable for processes for collecting, storing and using customer information at 3 DCMA org levels to include a CRM system design or is this merely an option we may, but are not required to, propose?  DCMA is looking for an effective CRM process to be developed for the Agency.  Offerors should propose accordingly.

31.	Has DCMA created any documentation (e.g., As-Is process maps, narrative descriptions of processes, etc.) to define its existing customer outreach and satisfaction measurement-related processes?  If so, will the supporting offeror have access to such documentation?  DCMA has process materials which will be made available at contract award.

32.	Has DCMA performed any benchmarking on the above-referenced processes?  If so, will the supporting offeror have access to such documentation?  DCMA has done no benchmarking.

33.	The DCMA RFQ notes that key personnel resumes and proposed prices can be provided as separate documents.  Can these documents be prepared in MS Word, or should they be prepared in PowerPoint?  MS Word is acceptable in addition to two paper copies of the offer.

34.	The RFQ refers to “near and longer term.”  How does DCMA define near term?  Longer term?  For example, is near term 1 year or less?  Is longer term over 1 year?  Near term is under 12 months and longer term is greater than 12 months. 

35.	For the required benchmarking, DCMA wants “…progressive public and private sector,    service-based organizations.”  Has DCMA identified how many organizations, by type (e.g., public sector), should be benchmarked?  No, DCMA expects offerors to make recommendations in this regard.

36.	Given the nature of the project, will the potential offeror have access to customers (e.g., Program Managers) to conduct interviews or data gathering workshops?  It is anticipated that DCMA will make available after contract award, results of prior customer surveys.

37.	The RFQ provides information on the proposal due date, number of copies for submission and the location for submission.  Upon arriving at the location, should proposal packages be left at the front desk or a designated individual?  There is a guard at the entry to the building who will call the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer to pickup the package.  Please allow sufficient time for mailing or delivery of your proposal.

38.	44. We are very interested in submitting a proposal in regards to this solicitation.  In preparation for this proposal, would it be possible for directors from our company to visit one of the Contract Management Offices (CMOs) during the next week? Is there a CMO near Boston, London and/or Paris?  If a visit is possible, what steps are  required ahead of time?   Pre-proposal site visits are not being made available to offerors.

39.	This solicitation does not make any reference to "training".   Shall we assume that this key piece should be included in the proposal for this solicitation, or will there be another solicitation specifically focusing on the training aspect?  No other procurements in conjunction with this requirement are anticipated.  Any required or proposed training should be included and priced in your proposal perhaps in Optional CLIN 0004 Implementation Process Plan and Assistance.

<DESC>LOCATION CHANGE FOR MOCAS RFI PRESOLICITATION CONFERENCE.

This Request for Information (RFI) is a request for interested parties to provide comments on the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) and other documentation that will be available at http://www.dfas.mil/aso/contract/ for the rehosting of the Mechanization of Contract Administrative Services (MOCAS) System.  DFAS is contemplating a firm fixed priced contract vehicle. 

MOCAS is an automated integrated financial and contract administration system developed in the late 1960’s and enhanced over the years to maintain regulatory compliance.  The system has over 8,600 authorized end users from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and other DoD components who access the system from locations worldwide.  MOCAS resides on a DISA mainframe at Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) and consists of three separate databases (MOCH, MOCL, MOCG) that serve two regions; East and West.  Each database has its own copy of executables (programs) and job control language (JCL).  MOCAS consists of both interactive on-line and batch system processing.  The primary mainframe programming languages are COBOL and MANTIS.  There are other interfaces, mid-tier, and desktop programs that operate using a variety of other languages and that are critical to the overall functions and support of MOCAS.  There are approximately 1.8 million lines of code per database.  However, the code is, in large part, mirrored in each of the three databases. 

The Government does not intend to issue a solicitation or award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for any information received in response to this RFI.  Any information received in response to this RFI that is marked propriety will be handled accordingly.  Information submitted under this RFI will not be returned.  

A presolicitation conference will be held by DFAS Columbus at 12:00 on March 31, 2003 at the: 

CONCOURSE HOTEL & CONFERENCE CENTER
4300 INTERNATIONAL GATEWAY
COLUMBUS, OHIO 43219

We have many historic artifacts; both publicly and privately owned (on loan) which are displayed to the public.  We also have many institutional accomplishments, trophies, awards, scholastic and faculty recognition that are displayed for the public throughout the USNA.

Therefore, the USNA has a recurring need for display services including but not limited to, design for presentation of spaces and furnishings in public areas such as:
·	Public and privately owned artifacts (Preble Hall Museum);
·	Naval Academy history and tradition (memorial Hall, John Paul Jones Crypt);
·	Academic Accomplishments (Nimitz Library, Michelson/Chauvenet Lobbies);
·	Individual professional achievements (Anders Hall of Fame); and
·	Individual and institutional athletic achievement (Robert Crown Sailing Center, Halsey Field House trophy rooms, McDonough Hall) 

Display of such items and spaces necessarily involves the immediate display structure and cabinetry, as well as room layout, surface finishes, order of displays, text displays associated with individual items, and the overall associated script or storyboard of the space.

The USNA requires services for both design and execution of these spaces and displays.

PRODUCTION AND INSTALLATION OF INFORMATIONAL OR COMMEMORATIVE PLAQUES

The USNA has a recurring requirement for production and installation of informational signs and commemorative plaques.

Throughout the Naval Academy many historic events, achievements, or contributions by individuals and organizations are recognized through displays, commemorative plaques, descriptive signage, or naming of facilities.  This necessitates a requirement to create and install various forms of plaques, signs, and descriptive displays.

The USNA requires services to design, create, and install various forms of signage and plaques, which includes, but is not limited to glass, plastic, Lucite, stone, metal, cast and/or engraved, these services will range from a simple notation plate to a series of displays.

If interested contractor, please fax a letter, on company letterhead, your interest for services to Mrs. Wilma Phoebus at (410) 293-5293.  Indicate which of the services you are interested in by Monday 5 May 2003.  

This notice is a Request for Information only.  No promise of future solicitation and/or contract award is guaranteed.  A vendor list will be established and maintained by the USNA Contract Office.

Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range.  The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders would be responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders would require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects would also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.

The offeror with the best value proposal, for each see project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the see projects if it is in the Government's best interest. The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the best overall proposal(s) for all seed projects after those offerors who have been awarded a seed project(s) have been removed from further competition.   A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s) where a seed project is not awarded.  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror(s) are awarded no task orders over the five (5) year contract term.

GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

BACKGROUND:  The position will be located in the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS), U.S. Embassy Bogota.  The incumbent advises NAS on environmental matters, principally in connection with the aerial eradication program.  The aerial eradication program is the backbone of Plan Colombia.  The technical reporting requirements in connection with this program have grown exponentially in recent years.  Congress is seeking ever more detailed environmental information on
the program and increasingly the trend is towards applying U.S. laws and regulations, by analogy if not by statute, to the program.  Additionally, NAS must comply with Colombian regulations.  

STATEMENT OF WORK

The PSC Environmental Advisor will perform the following basic functions:

A.  The incumbent will advise NAS on the environmental soundness of its counter-narcotics (CN) programs, helping to ensure that best practices are being used, all host-nation regulations are being complied with, and all U.S. statutory or regulatory requirements are being met.  The incumbent will share in supervision of the local national environmental contractor.  The incumbent will be
responsible for assisting in the preparation of all required reports concerning the environmental aspects of NAS programs.

B.  The incumbent will develop detailed analysis of the environmental effects of glyphosate, and assist other members of the country team in producing public diplomacy materials that communicate the facts regarding the safety and effectiveness of this herbicide.

C.  The incumbent will also collect and analyze data concerning the detrimental environmental effects of the cultivation and processing of narcotics.  In addition, the incumbent will work with other members of the country team and with host nation authorities to develop programs to provide information and education about these effects.  The goal is to change attitudes and opinions which now tolerate coca and opium poppy-related environmental degradation.

D.  The incumbent will accompany visitors and local personnel on field visits to review eradication programs and the use of glyphosate and assist in briefings on these issues.

E.  The incumbent will support the country team by preparing environmental strategies for use with host nation counterparts.  The incumbent will also help host nation agencies develop and integrate environmental policy and CN policy.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

A.  U.S. citizen eligible to Department of State Secret clearance.

C.  Thorough knowledge of U.S. environmental laws, regulations, and practices garnered through education and experience, preferably in a government agency.

D.  Educational and employment background in environmental science or a related field that would qualify the incumbent to evaluate the environmental impact of our CN programs, particularly aerial eradication, and recommend
environmental best-management practices to be used in those programs.

F.  Experience in leading and guiding policy dialog, international presentations, and negotiations.

G.   Knowledge of environmental and agricultural issues related to licit and illicit crops cultivated in Colombia.

importance to the governments of both our nations.

Supervision received/contract administration:

A.  The contractor shall work under the supervision of the
NAS Deputy Director American Embassy, Bogota, Colombia, who shall be designated as the Contracting Officer's
Representative (COR).

B.  The COR is authorized to act for the Contracting
Officer in matters concerning technical clarification,
inspection and, after concurrence by the Contracting
Officer, acceptance of contractor's performance under the
contract, including preparation of receiving reports and
authorization of progress payments, when appropriate.  The
COR will coordinate all work with the contractor and review
Contractor's performance at significant stages of its
Development.

In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to
alter and/or modify the specifications or the contract
terms and conditions, or waive the government's
requirement, price, or other terms and conditions, as it is
only the Contracting Officer that can authorize such
changes in writing.

Guidelines:  

Guidance is provided from Department and Administration policy and directives and operating procedures regarding U.S. international narcotics control matters.

Assignments include analysis of U.S. and host nation environmental regulations, observation of program compliance with these regulations, data gathering,
analysis, and reporting concerning the environmental
consequences of the narcotics trade and USG programs to
attack it.  Incumbent will be required to assist in
developing public awareness campaigns for use in the host
nation on the environmental consequences of the narcotics
trade and USG efforts to combat it.

Purpose of contacts:  The incumbent serves as the NAS
liaison with the host nation regarding environmental
issues.  As such, the incumbent must often employ
persuasion, diplomacy and cooperation to achieve USG goals.
Incumbent must also be able to help NAS in responding to
the environmental concerns of the U.S. Congress, press, and
public.

Language proficiency:  The incumbent must possess fluent Spanish as noted above.  The person selected for this position must be able to carry on technical and social
conversations, as well as be able to take effective notes
At appropriate times for subsequent report writing.

<DESC>NOTE: PLEASE SEE THE PDF FILE ATTACHED TO THIS SYNOPSIS (AS AN AMENDMENT) FOR EASIER VIEWING.  HQ Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) is seeking qualified sources to perform system requirements development for the GPS III program and potentially component advanced development.  The intended award will include up to 2 Contracts, $20M-25M each, with a 21-29 Month Period of Performance.  The purpose of these contracts is to mature the definition of the GPS III program to the System Requirements Review (SRR) level in support of the final selection of a single prime contractor to complete the development of the GPS III system.  In addition to completing the SRR, the selected contractor(s) will be required to provide expert engineering analysis of GPS requirements in support of Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Capabilities Definition Document (CDD) (similar to what was formerly known as the Operational Requirements Document (ORD)) update.  After SRR, the Government is planning to conduct a KDP-B milestone review consistent with draft National Security Space (NSS) Policy 03-01 using the products of this effort.  This effort may include selected component advanced development to address key design and/or schedule risk areas.  Follow-on phases of this program may involve the development, production, test, operations and support of a modified or replacement ground system as well as one or more increments or blocks of satellites.  Qualified contractors considering responding to this announcement should have an existing suite of capabilities to simulate and model GPS system performance, highly developed system and segment level architectural concepts and designs, and a strong background in GPS systems engineering, including all GPS interfaces.  Offerors must currently be registered in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration database in accordance with Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Part 204.7302 to be eligible for award of the contract.  All formal responses to this notice must be received by 7 May 2003.  All interested offerors should respond with a statement of capabilities in accordance with numbered note 25 below, by either e-mail to  GPSIIIinquiries@losangeles.af.mil (if respondents wish to encrypt the electronic correspondence, please contact by e-mail for further details) or mail to: William S. Trombetta, 2420 Vela Way Suite 1866, El Segundo, Ca 90245. 

PROGRAM OVERVIEW: The GPS III program objective is to develop and deploy an improved systems architecture for the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) to assure reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position, velocity, and timing (PVT) signals for the evolving needs of GPS civil and military users.  GPS III eliminates numerous existing shortcomings and vulnerabilities inherent in the current GPS architecture that threaten to severely impact vital civil commerce, transportation, public safety, as well as military operations in the future.  GPS III enhances U.S. leadership in space-based navigation by meeting the stated Presidential goal of establishing GPS as a world standard.  GPS III supports the Federal Radionavigation Plan and will be fully interoperable with all current global radionavigation systems. The GPS III system also incorporates the Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS) and provides a potential platform for supporting additional synergistic payloads and services.  The Government intends to use an evolutionary development approach.  This approach includes using a modular open systems architecture, standard interfaces and protocols, and continuous technology refresh, to incrementally improve system capabilities with a low risk of GPS service interruption. 

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (for any resulting solicitation): This effort will require access to and processing of classified information up to and including TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) and SAP/SAR (Special Access Program/Special Access Requirements) security requirements.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and regulations.

<SUBJECT>66--AML Scanning Electron Beam Research Metrology Platform
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. ***The National Institute of Standards & Technology, (NIST), is soliciting information for a scanning electron beam research and metrology platform for the new Advanced Metrology Laboratory (AML) currently being constructed.  This will be a very specialized instrument.  Currently, there is no known commercial instrument that can meet all of NIST's requirements.***The fundamental requirements for this instrument are outlined in this request for information, and manufacturers are invited to provide information relating to their current and future instrumentation relative to these specifications.  Final specifications will be determined based on information gathered through this inquiry.***Equipment Name: AML Scanning Electron Beam Research and Metrology Platform;  Requesting Office: NIST/ Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory/Precision Engineering Division; Project/Program: Scanning Electron Microscope-based Metrology/Nanometer Scale; Dimensional Metrology.***DESCRIPTION: The AML Scanning Electron Beam Research and Metrology Platform (SEBMP) is a unique reference measurement instrument.  This instrument incorporates advanced laser interferometry in the specimen stage to accurately track the X and Y motion of the stage.  This instrument will be used for the development and calibration of accurate length metrology reference artifacts and to provide dimensional metrology solutions on samples that can be measured by an electron beam as the probe.***PROGRAMATIC RATIONALE: Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) are widely used in U. S. research, development and manufacturing, especially in the fields of nanotechnology and microelectronics where individual device sizes are now approaching few tens of nanometers, but overall sample size is 300 mm or greater. A modern scanning electron beam research and metrology platform is needed for the AML in order to satisfy the NIST customers' needs for length standards on large substrates (silicon wafers and photomasks) and to initiate breakthroughs in accurate metrology using scanned electron beam instrumentation.***Currently, the NIST SEM metrology instrumentation is severely limited by overall specimen dimension. Because of this limitation, larger samples like semiconductor production wafers, 2-dimensional grids and photomasks cannot be measured even if the existing, better than industrial metrology capability would allow the needed measurements. Many NIST customers, therefore, cannot be properly served without damaging or compromising the sample (specimen breakage, sawing or drop-in wafers).***Designed and developed properly, this SEBRMP is more than just an inspection instrument or a metrology tool. This instrument will be a unique instrument, which will enable vast improvement in measurement accuracy and precision on a variety of samples including defects and particles in the nanometer size range.***The Scanning Electron Beam Research and Metrology Platform is an indispensable research instrument, appropriate for the AML. This instrument will be a platform capable of ultra-high resolution imaging, characterization, and dimensional metrology of structures down to a few nanometers. The instrument will be capable of investigating samples as large as whole silicon wafers or phase-shifting photomasks and as small as the samples of nanotechnology research and development (standard stub size). This instrument will be unique in the world and will become a length reference measurement instrument for a whole host of artifacts. Capabilities are planned to include operation at various specimen chamber vacuum levels and “environmental” modes, a wide range of accelerating voltages (electron energies), landing energies and electron energy filtering with magnifications up to 500,000 times and spatial resolution down to 2 nm or better. The instrument will utilize NIST expertise in the development of  interferometry for quick nanometer-level and slower picometer-level positioning and measurement accuracy. NIST is and has been developing laser control and data acquisition software for the current KLA/AMRAY SEM Metrology Instrument and that software is available for incorporation into the new instrument. This instrument will employ and exploit the contrast mechanisms advantageous or existing only for nanometer-sized structures. Three-dimensional imaging and metrology will be possible with extensive image processing and analysis, which allows the full use of information generated. It also will have a capability to form, modify and measure in-situ structures a few tens of nanometers in size with the electron beam. It will serve as the platform for accurate dimensional measurements of semiconductor wafers with nanometer structures, and it will be the practical complement to the theoretical modeling work of 2- and 3-dimensional metrology of nano-structures and devices. This instrument will be one of the most important tools used in nanotechnology that advances the measurement science, development, and theoretical modeling of nano-structured materials and devices.
