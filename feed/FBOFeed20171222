<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.<br /> <br />Title:  Metabolic Epidemiology Branch Support Services<br /> <br />The Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of National Cancer Institute (NCI) is re-competing a full and open contract for support services for feasibility projects, pilot studies, methodologic studies, specialized tasks in large scale studies, full scale support for cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives</span></p>
<p>A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis.  Studies within MEB focus on the role of nutrition, energy balance, hormones, and metabolism in cancer etiology through population-based epidemiologic studies.  MEB research relies heavily on large prospective cohort studies, but the portfolio includes targeted case-control, cross-sectional, and case series analyses as needed.  These studies are carried out in environments that are optimal for achieving scientific goals and may include special high-risk populations.</p>
<p>To achieve its goals, MEB's approach has been to (1) integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers into interdisciplinary molecular epidemiologic investigations to understand a variety of exposures as related to multiple cancers and gain insights into mechanisms that mediate risk factors; (2) sub-divide tumors into etiologically and prognostically distinct entities; (3) examine natural history of and progression for cancer precursors; (4) address rapidly emerging issues in cancer epidemiology through novel investigations of poorly understood risk factors and under-studied cancers; and (5) assist in training the next generation of molecular epidemiologists.</p>
<p>The philosophical focus of MEB research is to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that relate carefully defined exposure assessments to specific outcomes to provide new insights into cancer etiology, hormonal carcinogenesis, and to investigate the roles of diet, body size, and physical activity and their mechanisms of action including intermediate biologic markers.  Molecular approaches play a critical and increasingly important role in MEB research. Approximately twenty-eight studies will likely receive support under the contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Requirement</span></p>
<p>This support services contract is essential for MEB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers to provide new insights into cancer etiology and mechanisms of action. The NCI/MEB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of epidemiologic studies, including support for pilot and feasibility efforts to assess capabilities for launching multidisciplinary studies, development of precise methods of defining exposures to identify new causes of cancer and to adequately characterize the shape of the exposure-response relationship, and to understand the interaction of genetic and environmental factors related to cancer risk.  Thus, the support services contractor will need to provide staff with high quality logistical skills, knowledge of epidemiological studies and diverse biological specimens, and appreciation of specimen collection and handling requirements to enable technologically sophisticated assay development and performance.  The contractor will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, pilot, and feasibility) studies.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the activities described in the attached <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draft</span> Statement of Work.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261201300016C held by Westat, Inc.</p>
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that one contract may be awarded beginning on or about December 31, 2018.  The anticipated period of performance is January 1, 2019 - August 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) plans to procure, on a sole source basis, 3,000 - 16,000 doses of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 Virus-like Particles with Alum-adjuvant Vaccine (Gardasil-9) from Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corporation; One Merck Drive; Whitehouse Station, NJ, 08889-3400.
<p>The response close date of the notice for this requirement is in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)(1). This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(2); and, is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 325412 and the business size standard is $38.5 million.</p>
<p>The anticipated award shall be a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract. The period of performance of the resulting IDIQ award shall consist of a 3-year ordering period.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The vaccines required under the proposed contract vehicle will ultimately be used in an NCI clinical trial, the ESCUDDO study. This study has multiple components, including a non-inferiority randomized clinical trial of one vs. two doses of nonavalent and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) bivalent vaccines; a comparison of new Human Papillomavirus (HPV) persistent infections between one and two doses of the vaccines to a contemporaneous unvaccinated group, similar in age and region of residence to the vaccinated groups; and, an economic evaluation of each vaccine and dose regimen, in the context of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Required Item(s) / Specifications:</p>
<p>-Vaccines shall be provided in vial form<br />-Vaccines shall have a minimum of 18-month shelf life post-delivery<br />-Vaccines shall be stored at 2-8&deg;C (34-46&deg;F)<br />-Vaccines shall not be frozen<br />-The Contractor shall maintain the temperature of vaccines during <br />shipment</p>
<p>Delivery:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall deliver all required items within 14 days of each delivery order placed against the anticipated IDIQ award. Items shall be shipped to the following address:</p>
<p>National Cancer Institute - Frederick<br />1050 Boyles Street, Bldg 1050<br />Frederick, MD 21702-1201</p>
<p>Payment:</p>
<p>Payment authorization requires submission and approval of invoices to the NCI Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and NIH Office of Financial Management (OFM), in accordance with the payment provisions in the order.</p>
<p>The vaccines required under this proposed contract vehicle will ultimately be used in an NCI clinical trial, the ESCUDDO study. The study has multiple components, including a non-inferiority randomized clinical trial of one vs. two doses of nonavalent and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) bivalent vaccines; a comparison of new Human Papillomavirus (HPV) persistent infections between one and two doses of the vaccines to a contemporaneous unvaccinated group, similar in age and region of residence to the vaccinated groups; and, an economic evaluation of each vaccine and dose regimen, in the context of Costa Rica. Gardasil-9 vaccines were previously purchased, via purchase order number HHSN261201800084P, through Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corporation (Merck) for the same study. Merck received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to manufacture and commercially sell Gardasil-9. As the sole manufacturer of Gardasil-9, Merck is the only known source capable of creating and providing substantial doses of the vaccine to the NCI on demand. Additionally, the NCI/DCEG/IIB's procurement of vaccines through Merck is essential to maintain consistency and be scientifically comparable with previous data. The public health implications of this work are enormous and any delay in the delivery of the required vaccines would consequently delay policy change, and impede implementation of HPV vaccine programs. Therefore, Merck is the only source capable to meet the NCI needs for this procurement.</p>

<SUBJECT>A comprehensive and holistic performance based supply chain management program in support of the AH-64 and CH-47 aircraft parts. 
<SOLNBR>SPRPA1-18-R-002U
<RESPDATE>010518
<CONTACT>irena cepele, Contracting Officer , Phone 2157373762, Email irena.cepele@dla.mil
<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Aviation Philadelphia will solicit a nine (9) (5 year priced base period and a 4 year unpriced option period) year Firm Fixed Price Incentive Fee proposal for the acquisition of a comprehensive and holistic performance based supply chain management program in support of the AH-64 and CH-47 aircraft parts. The anticipated contract will be awarded against the Boeing Captains of Industry (BCOI) contract, SPRPA1-14-D-002U. The BCOI contract is strategic in nature and will be the primary vehicle for the direct material support. The BCOI contract has a performance period of five (5) year base period with one five (5) year option to extend the contract for a total performance period of ten years.
<p>For this effort, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Boeing Company, Cage Code 0PXV4, located in Saint Louis, MO, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The contractor will be required to provide consumables for the AH-64 and the CH-47 repair and depot overhaul activities; however, actual repair of depot level items is not included in this requirement. The contractor will be required to deliver their supplies to the Government within the specified time windows.</p>
<p>Under the BCOI contract the contractor will provide following: logistics management, which includes wholesale supply support, depot-level consumable support, material management, engineering support and sustainment elements, packaging, storage, reliability improvements, and field engineering support.</p>
<p>For the direct material support, the contractor will be required to meet supply chain performance based on metrics for material availability and order response time to approximately 1,539 NSNs. The performance metrics will be based on the level of demand for the individual NSN.</p>
<p>The engineering support provided will be for the AH-64 and CH-47 aircraft, airframe, systems, components, and accessories. Tasks include requests for Boeing repair and design engineering expertise as it applies to the depot maintenance and repair initiatives for items designed and/or distributed by Boeing.</p>
<p>Performance Based functions will include: demand forecasting; inventory management; warehousing; supply chain engineering support; training; material support and availability; process improvements; and field service representative. Flexibility to add more items is necessary as requirements dictate.</p>
<p>Due to the age of the weapon systems, drawings are no longer be up-to-date; tooling may no longer be available or un-useable; materials may be obsolete and the vendor base may have diminished since the parts were last purchased. DLA lacks sufficient technical data to compete this requirement effectively and Boeing possesses the technical capability and the data to produce these items. The contract is planned as a Firm Fixed Price Incentive Fee action against the BCOI contract, which is strategic in nature and will be the primary vehicle for procurement of a wide range of supplies.<br /><br />Many of the items that will be included in this contract are currently procured under the Army contract W58RGZ-15-D-0060.</p>
<p>A full list of NIINs and the respective FSCs is attached. See Market Basket.</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with Public Law 92-582, the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.</p>
<p>The scope of this proposed contract will include task orders for A-E design construction support services for projects under the military sustainment, restoration and modernization (SRM) programs. This acquisition will support a broad range of required services to include preparation of design-bid-build and design-build solicitations for new construction and renovation and repair projects, utility system studies, and related construction management services at the various locations at JBLM.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a target of between three (3) and five (5) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts will be negotiated and awarded, each with a five (5) year base-period and no option period. However, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all.</p>
<p>The total, shared capacity for this contract is $30,000,000 ($30.0M) cumulative for the 5-year contract period. Individual task orders shall not exceed $1.0M, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer. The minimum guarantee for the contract will be two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00).</p>
<p>Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders; all task orders are subject to availability of funds.</p>
<p>When the requirement is identified, the government will notify all contractors in the pool that an evaluation will be conducted. The notification will include whether the contractor's Standard Form 330 (SF330) will be used, or if the government requires unique experience or qualifications to be submitted for the task order evaluation. Specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality will be considered for task orders to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work. In the event two firms are technically equal based on the previously listed selection criteria, secondary criteria will be considered.</p>
<p>North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 - Engineering Services. Firms must be capable of providing support for program requirements for construction phase A-E Services to include planning, studies, design, and design support. The A-E services will be primarily for construction phase A-E services that will be utilized by the NWS Lewis and Clark Project Office (LACPO) for projects at JBLM and other Department of Defense (DoD) sites.</p>
<p>This announcement is open to all small business concerns. For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its annual gross receipts are $15M or less.</p>
<p>The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to where the services will be performed.</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must have a DUNS number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) and be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). For information in regard to opening a SAM account, see the following link for instructions: https://www.sam.gov/sam/transcript/Quick_Guide_for_Contract_Registrations_v1.7.pdf.</p>
<p>Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov or by calling (866) 606-8220.</p>
<p>At least 50 percent of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the Prime/JV.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Task Orders may entail work associated with the following design services; utilize Government designs, drawings, specifications, and standards for buildings, structures and other facilities as necessary to meet the requirements of the proposed project; and prepare, subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer, charrettes, preliminary studies, sketches, layout plans, reports and cost estimates of the proposed project. Effort may also include supporting government project managers in their negotiations with construction contractors prior to award of construction Task Orders.

DESIGN REVIEW REQUIREMENTS:  Provide A/E Design Services (BASE BID) for the preparation of Design Documents, Cost Estimates, and Construction Documents.  

All offerors are advised that in accordance with VAAR 836.606-73, the total cost of the contract for A-E services must not exceed 6 percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities. Additionally, FAR Clause 52.236-22 (c) - Design Within Funding Limitation, will be applicable to this procurement action.  Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly rated A-E firm selected to complete the design.

Interested firms should submit one paper copy and one CD copy of their current SF-330 to: Nebraska-Western Iowa HCS, Omaha VA Medical Center, ATTN:  Sharon Spohn (90C), 4101 Woolworth Avenue, Omaha, NE 68105-1850.  The SF-330s are due on January 24, 2018 at 2:00 PM (CST).  Use the instructions located in section fourteen (14) below for submitting your SF-330.

NO FAX OR EMAIL RESPONSES WILL BE ACCEPTED:  Personal visits for the purpose of discussing this announcement will not be entertained or scheduled.  Selection shall be in order of preference from the firms considered Most Highly Qualified.  Questions may be directed only by e-mail to Sharon.Spohn@va.gov.

In accordance with FAR 36.209   Construction Contracts with A-E Firms and 36.606 (c), all interested contractors are hereby put on notice that no construction contract may be awarded to the firm that ultimately designs this requirement.

Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f) and 52.215-1(c).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission.

Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.

To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as  unreadable  pursuant to FAR Part and FAR 15.207(c ). 

Password protecting your SF-330 is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated Government individuals.

The selection of the most qualified contractor will follow the guidance provided in FAR 36.6   Architect-Engineer Services.  Additionally, this solicitation is also issued in accordance with Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare Information and Technology Act of 2006, Sections 502 and 503, as a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contractors. Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to SDVOSB construction firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB contractors will be received under this solicitation. 

Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF-330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal/SF-330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The estimated magnitude for construction (not design) of this project is between $1,000,000.00 and $2,000,000.00.  
Contract Award Procedure: At time of award, the contractor must be certified by VetBiz and registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Register via the SAM internet site at www.sam.gov. Failure of an SDVOSB to be VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE in VetBiz shall result in elimination from consideration as a potential contract awardee. Failure of a SDVOSB to be registered in SAM at the time of contract award shall result in elimination from consideration as a proposed contract awardee. The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. 

The review/design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished by architects or engineers registered in a State or possession of the United States, or in Puerto Rico or in the District of Columbia.

The project drawings/design shall be in compliance with applicable standards and codes described in VA Program Guides and design materials. Master Construction Specifications Index, VA Construction Standards Index, VA Standards Index, and Criteria are available in the Technical Information Library (TIL) on VA Website address: http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/.

The awarded A-E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The awarded A-E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A-E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330 with a small business size of $15 million.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, type in SF-330 in the  Find a Form  block and click on search.

<DESC><p>The Directorate of Contracting's Contracting Construction Section (AFTC/PZIOC) at the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB, CA is conducting preliminary planning market research in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to obtain information from potential eligible and interested contractors for an anticipated five-year, firm-fixed-price (FFP) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) construction contract for a broad range of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) requirements to include repair, maintenance, and replacement of HVAC systems. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220, Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors, with a small business size standard of $15M. The Service Code is J041, Maintenance and Repair of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning Equipment.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 19.203(c), the anticipated acquisition will be a competitive 8(a) Program set-aside since the requirement has been accepted by the Small Business Administration under the 8(a) Program. The Government is particularly interested in determining if there are certified 8(a) Program Participants with a bona fide place of business located in the State of California who are interested in and capable of meeting this requirement.</p>
<p>Description of Work: The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, and supervision required to perform repair, maintenance, and replacement of HVAC systems inclusive of Energy Management &amp; Control Systems (EMCS). The Contractor shall meet all applicable Federal, State, and local codes, Air Force Instruction (AFI) requirements, Uniform Facility Criteria, and the Edwards AFB Base Design Standards, except for Architect-Engineer (A-E) services as referenced in the design standards. No A-E type work is included in this requirement.</p>
<p>AFTC/PZIOC requests that responsible, capable, and interested 8(a) Program Participants submit a response to this sources sought with the information below:</p>
<p>1. Company name, CAGE code, and DUNS number; <br />2. Bonding capacity for single award and aggregate; <br />3. Brief information on recent (within past five years) experience with HVAC projects, particularly the type of contract performed on (e.g. Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), etc.), the dollar value of the project, and where the work took place (State of CA, military installation, State/Local Government agency, etc.).</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This is a request for information/sources sought announcement ONLY and is for planning purposes only. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; no contract will be awarded from this notice and this notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. The Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of any information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT.

The purpose of this sources sought announcement is for market research to make an appropriate acquisition decision and to gain knowledge of potential qualified businesses interested and capable of providing the services described below. Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.

Background
Executive Order (EO) 13149 - Greening the Government through Federal Fleet and Transportation Efficiency, EO 13423 - Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, and EO 13693 - Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade requires the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to reduce petroleum products and fuel consumption.  In an effort to continue to improve BLMs greening posture the BLM National Fleet Management Program is mandating the use of Bypass Oil Filtration (BOF) Systems and oil analysis on all medium and heavy trucks including fire equipment and other equipment where applicable. The BOF system shall be install on all equipment that can accommodate it. By installing these systems and the use of oil sampling analysis BLM's goal is to reduce the frequency of oil changes and thus the quantity of petroleum/ synthetic oils consumed. Equipment without the necessary space to accommodate the system will use oil sampling to determine a Base Line and when fluids will need to be changed.  Other fluids i.e. transmission, cooling systems, differentials, and hydraulic systems shall also be sampled.

Scope
BLM requires testing of all fluid samples delivered to a certified laboratory to determine fluid condition.  Analysis shall be performed by a certified new and used oil sampling laboratory that, at a minimum, is certified in accordance with ISO-9000 or ISO-17025 and participates in the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Proficiency Test Programs. 

The laboratory shall analyze the sample properties, looking for suspended contaminants, and wear debris in excess of normal operating parameters. Analysis is performed during scheduled maintenance for engine, transmission, differentials, transfer case, hydraulic oil, and coolant to provide meaningful and accurate information on lubricant and component condition.

Results shall be provided within 48 hours utilizing an online reporting system. Any results outside of the acceptable range shall be reported immediately. BLM has 1,789 vehicles to be tested and estimates the following numbers of tests per year:
Oil Samples	        6044	  	
Coolant Samples         3454	     	
Hydraulic Samples         75           

BLM is also requesting training on how to correctly provide a sample for laboratory analysis. The training may be provided by webinar, in person, or through a brochure.

This study is aimed at determining the presence and prevalence of Rickettsial diseases.</p>
<p>This effort requires:<br />&bull; Obtain IRB and Scientific Committee Approval prior to initiation of hospital-based study. <br />&bull; Provide Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and training as necessary for rickettsial, oriential and coxiella investigations in order to ensure safe and effective implementation of project activities.<br />&bull; Develop Data Storage Capability, where data collection formats will be used collaboratively between the scientists and the statistician. Data will be collected by trained study staff via standardized electronic case record forms (eCRFs) using tablets and uploaded to a dedicated central serverover 3G or WiFi.<br />&bull; Recruit patients and discuss with hospital management of 3 national hospital and 24 provincial hospitals the proposed project and obtain agreement. Provide project overview to personnel involved in study, to include their roles and tasks. Provide GCP and protocol training for hospital personnel involved in study to include: Administrators, Physicians (identify patients to request their enrollment in study, enroll patients, collect eCRF (i.e. patient history and physical examination), and notify study nurse), Study Nurse (collection of consent forms and completed epidemiologic questionnaire, collection of acute samples (i.e. clotted blood, whole EDTA blood for serologic and molecular assays, respectively) before treatment.<br />&bull; Transport all Samples to BSL-2 Laboratory for Serologic and Molecular Analysis and use a professional transport company to transfer these samples.<br />&bull; Perform ELISA on serum samples (acute samples) (n=2,700-4,100) collected from patients.<br />&bull; Identify evidence of previous infection with spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR), typhus group rickettsiae (TGR), scrub typhus group orientiae (STGO) and Coxiella burnetii IgG ELISAs. <br />&bull; Conduct qPCR assays to identify rickettsiae, orientiae, and C. burnetii from DNA extracted from whole blood (EDTA) samples. This will identify active cases of diseases and either genus- or species specific. Use of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is required if a species-specific qPCR assay is not available to make the agent identification.<br />&bull; Combine patient clinical (history and PE), location (GPS of village), serology, and qPCR information/results. Perform data analysis and summarize clinical, epidemiologic and laboratory data. Calculate prevalence of rickettsial diseases, scrub typhus and Q fever among fever patients admitted to 27 hospitals in 26 provinces throughout Vietnam by molecular methods. In addition, calculate prevalence of antibodies to SFGR, TGR, STGO and C. burnetii among fever patients. The acquired data will be entered into CliRes for subsequent analysis by EpiInfo to determine statistical data analysis of pathogen prevalence. <br />&bull; Generate GIS maps that will be used to create thematic maps of disease prevalence for the 8 ecological regions of Vietnam for each disease and perform GIS analyses.<br />&bull; Identify10 random villages, towns and/or cities (hotspots) per each of 8 agro-ecological regions (80 sites) based on the demographical information yielded from hospital-based study to investigate the risk for rickettsial diseases, scrub typhus and/or Q fever. For each commune 40 households (approximately 4-5 people/house) should be randomly selected for a cross-sectional study to estimate the seroprevalence of rickettsial diseases, scrub typhus, and Q fever. Total number of villagers to be enrolled for the 8-region IRB approved study should be approximately 16,000.<br />&bull; Draft and submit reports to MoH and DTRA and develop presentation(s) for scientific/medical meeting(s) and a manuscript(s) for publication.<br />&bull; All activities must be carried out with the outmost adherence to all ethical and quality standards in order to minimize risk of performance slips and comply with appropriation of funds and expectations of the sponsor. <br />The period of performance is expected to be 12 months from the date of contract approval and three additional Option Periods.<br />If capable sources are not identified through this notice, then NMLC intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (One source) to National Hospital of Tropical Diseases (NHTD) in Vietnam, for the performance of the described requirement.</p>
<p>National Hospital of Tropical Diseases (NHTD)is the only source able to meet our research needs for Vietnam. NHTD has a large trajectory of treatment and research in infectious and tropical diseases. This institution is the only one with the required local approvals in place, the appropriate financial, human and technical resources, experience and organizational controls needed to accomplish the study's goals.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work.

All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 12:00 PM Local Time, 29 December 2017. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address:<br />thomas.l.hood26.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Intramural Research (DIR) and Vaccine Research Center (VRC) require qualified and experienced personnel to support a full-range of activities, including new and in-progress research projects, program deployment and implementation, ongoing management and operations, and other activities necessary to conduct the business of the NIAID's research program. NIAID conducts and supports basic, translational and clinical research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. Infectious diseases include global killers such as human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria; emerging and re-emerging threats such as influenza, novel pathogenic coronaviruses (e.g., Middle East respiratory syndrome), Ebola, Zika, chikungunya, multidrug-resistant bacteria (e.g., multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB); and "deliberately emerging" threats from potential agents of bioterrorism. Immune-mediated disorders include autoimmune diseases such as lupus and type 1 diabetes; asthma; allergies; and graft rejection and other problems associated with tissue and organ transplantation.<br /><br />For more than 60 years, NIAID research has led to new therapies, vaccines, diagnostic tests and other technologies that have improved the health of millions of people in the US and around the world. The scope of NIAID research portfolio has expanded considerably in recent years in response to new challenges such as bioterrorism, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, and the increase of asthma prevalence among children in this country.<br /><br />The Government intends to increase the current ceiling of contract HHSN272201500015I by $49,000,000.00 from $130,023,570.00 to $179,023,570 for services in support of the NIAID DIR and VRC. It is estimated that a follow-on contract for the services described below will be solicited and awarded no later than September of 2018.<br /><br />This is a non-personal services contract to provide Professional, Scientific, and Technical Support Services for the DIR and the&nbsp;VRC.<br /><br />The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, other items and non-personal services necessary to provide technical support in the areas as defined&nbsp;in the Performance Work Statement except for those items specified as Government-furnished property and services; 1) Scientific research and analysis support; 2) Bioinformatics and computational biology; 3) Scientific and technical writing; 4) Scientific and medical domain expertise; 5) Scientific and research data management; 6) Laboratory management and support; 7) Scientific project management; 8) Information systems support; and 9) Clinical support services. The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.&nbsp; <br /><br />The contractor must demonstrate the ability&nbsp;to, upon immediate request,&nbsp;recruit and maintain a stable, highly specialized and experienced staff with advanced degrees (M.D. and Ph.D.) in biomedical research in metropolitan Washington, D.C. as well as rural regions such as Hamilton, Montana. In addition, the contractor must demonstrate the ability&nbsp;to quickly provide&nbsp;staffing for research in high containment&nbsp;BSL (Biosafety Level) 3 and BSL 4 environments. The contractor must demonstrate prior experience in supporting clinical trials within the US as well as Africa, India and other countries. When needed, the contractor is required to attract and retain foreign scientists and must demonstrate the ability to&nbsp;sponsor work visas and provide permanent residence assistance for employees and their families.&nbsp;The contractor will need to demonstrate prior experience in all requirements stated above and in supporting employee growth and development by providing training and education assistance as well as supporting attendance and participation at scientific conferences. Administratively, the contractor is&nbsp;required to demonstrate the ability to provide a dedicated program management staff with experience and skill in similar activities of comparable scope and complexity as well as a corporate infrastructure to accommodate a contract of this size and complexity.<br /><br />The NIAID intends to negotiate, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1, on a sole source basis, with Medical Science and Computing, Inc., an&nbsp;increase the current ceiling of contract HHSN272201500015I by $49,000,000.00 from $130,023,570.00 to $179,023,570.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />No other source is able to provide these critical/essential services beginning in January&nbsp;2018 without causing unacceptable delays to the Government in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement. All capability statements received within fifteen days from the date of the publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Any concerned parties may address questions to the Contract Specialist, Patrick Wilson, at wilsonpm@mail.nih.gov. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<SUBJECT>Upgrade for Brooks Automation A3 Compounds Storage System to Windows 7 and Oracle 12
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NIDA-SS-2018-58

<CONTACT>Jeffrey Schmidt, Phone (301) 443-6677, Fax (301) 443-7595, Email schmidtjr@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) requires an upgrade to our A3 Compound Storage System that functions in the sorting, storing, research and growth of the Assay Development and High Throughput Screening program.  This instrument is used to help maximize efficiency and improve throughput of these cell based assays by automating inventory and storage of essential compound sample libraries.  The upgrade is needed to ensure the controlling PC and associated database software are actively supported.

<DESC><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />SSH20180010
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; Veteran and Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses, Women-owned Small Businesses and Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) to provide. <br />an on-line subscription to help comply with statutory requirements regarding Capital Ratios, Budget Re-estimates, Credit Reforms, and Credit Risk Analysis. This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) insures an average of approximately $40 billion in multifamily rental projects each year. In doing so, it evaluates the market absorption potential for these projects and how they relate to existing projects in the market. HUD has two objectives. One is to avoid financing projects in markets where it is anticipated there will be an excess supply of rental units by the time the project is completed, thereby reducing the risk of default for the proposed project. The other is to avoid increasing vacancy levels above desired levels in the market to reduce the risk to financial viability of existing rental projects, some of whose mortgages HUD may have insured. Most of HUD's multifamily mortgage business is concentrated in metropolitan areas, especially large, fast-growing areas. Detailed information on the location, type, rents, and vacancy rates of existing and newly developed multifamily rental projects is highly valuable in estimating the impacts and potential absorption of rental projects applying for HUD mortgage insurance or subsidy assistance. A limited amount of rental vacancy rate data is available from the Bureau of the Census. This information is collected in greater detail for multifamily rental projects by a limited number of firms that sell it to interested parties in a standardized format. HUD is interested in purchasing such data to assist it in carrying out its market analysis functions. <br />Provide capability of the following tasks:</p>
<p>I. Housing Market Analysis Data<br />All rent comparability, submarket and metropolitan market report for 165 primary, secondary and tertiary metropolitan multifamily markets, including quarterly executive-level summary data, rankings and analyses on U.S. and regional markets, as well as a variety of special research studies. For the 50 primary metropolitan markets, this data includes:</p>
<p>A. Details on supply, demand, vacancies, rents, and related market indicators on metropolitan markets for the multifamily, office, retail and industrial sectors. Submarket-level detail for multifamily, office and retail markets are included. Annual and quarterly trends are presented, along with five-year forecasts. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) and Excel (xls) formats.</p>
<p>B. Metropolitan market and submarket details on supply, demand, rents and vacancies for Class A and B/C properties for the multifamily and office sectors. Annual and quarterly trends are presented. Now updated monthly. Available in Excel (xls) formats.</p>
<p>C. Aggregate and property-specific rent comp group reports including rents and vacancies, in addition to five-year historical trends for aggregate rent comp groups for the multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) and Excel (xls) formats.</p>
<p>D. Individual property sales, including transaction and property characteristics for multifamily, office, retail and industrial sectors. Updated weekly.</p>
<p>E. Economic and real estate analysis in narrative form on most metropolitan areas. The reports discuss key multifamily, office, retail and industrial supply and demand trends in each metropolitan market, pinpoint under-performing and outperforming submarkets. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format.<br /><br />F. Current market indicators across all submarkets in each metropolitan market, including rents, vacancies, free rent concessions, and expenses for multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly. Available in Excel (xls) format.</p>
<p>G. Building-level listings and summary statistics for submarkets and metropolitan markets are presented of planned/proposed, projects under construction and recently completed for the multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly.</p>
<p>H. Daily real estate and economic stories are posted from the leading local newspapers and periodicals across the nation, initially coded into relevant metropolitan markets and topic categories (e.g. multifamily construction). A searchable 90-day archive is maintained. Updated daily and available in an HTML format.</p>
<p>II. Data Files<br />EXCEL data files with supply demand and rent time series data (from 1980 in most<br />markets) for the Primary Markets and selected market aggregations are extractable for all database variables for the 30 secondary metropolitan markets data and reports provided in the following: <br />(a), but without the forecasts;<br />(c), but without the historical trends; and<br />(g) and (h) are available.</p>
<p>For the 85-tertiary metropolitan markets the information provided is the same as for the secondary markets, with less submarket details and historical data is limited to the past 3-4 years.</p>
<p>III. Sales Comp Module</p>
<p>A database of apartment transactions valued at $2 million or more in all 80 primary and secondary markets and for 85 tertiary markets.</p>
<p>IV. Transaction Analytics Module<br />This is a database that includes sales transaction activity. It provides mean, median and 12-month-rolling cap rates, sales price data by price per unit or square foot, and total transaction volume. Transaction trends are available by quarter back to 2005 for metropolitan areas, regions, and the U.S. This module also provides data on top deals, with buyer and seller information, and on key submarket transaction activity. HUD will use this information to identify sales and capital market trends in the multifamily real estate market and assess troubled debt.</p>
<p>V. Single Property Valuation Tool<br /><br />Allows the user to enter their assumptions or observations on current building performance, select a variety of forecast options based on observations and predictions at the submarket and metro levels, and select some final assumptions in terms of terminal cap rates, additional income and other variable affecting property value. The result is three distinct market values based on the DCF, Sales Comp and Direct Cap methodologies.</p>
<p>VI. Expanding Markets<br />Currently FHA has access to 200 apartment markets throughout the United States. With this acquisition HUD will have access to an additional 75 markets</p>

<DESC>1. SUBJECT: The United States Army Medical Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) is conducting market research on technological solutions for intracavitary noncompressible (abdominal) hemorrhage, commonly referred to as internal bleeding, for field use in a battlefield setting. This market research may also assist with the further development or refinement of the U.S. Army and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements.
<p>2. DISCLAIMER: This sources sought notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this sources sought notice. Responses to this sources sought notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this sources sought notice. All information received in response to this sources sought notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Information received in response to this notice will not be returned. At this time, the Government will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future requirements.</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: Intracavitary noncompressible hemorrhage, or internal bleeding, represents a significant cause of preventable death in the military. Additionally, intracavitary noncompressible hemorrhage leads to significant deaths each year in the civilian population. Currently, there are no existing point-of-injury therapies to treat intracavitary noncompressible hemorrhage. In resource-constrained environments, such as the battlefield, the only option for patients is to be transported to surgical capabilities to control this type of hemorrhage. The U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) has identified a need for an intracavitary noncompressible technological solution for use by troops in deployed environments.</p>
<p>4. REQUIREMENTS: The Government is seeking a cost-effective portable intracavitary noncompressible hemorrhage solution method for treating wounds. The solution shall be lightweight, durable, and operable on the battlefield. The solution shall be able to be used in-flight and in austere environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Responses shall address the requirements identified in paragraph 4a. of this source sought notice. Responses shall include a representative sample of the solution for limited examination. Sample items submitted will not be returned.</p>
<p>4a. MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS: The product developer's technology shall:</p>
<p>Demonstrate hemostasis within 4-minutes by delivery and transport of hemostatic material throughout abdominal cavity to the injury in pre-clinical models.</p>
<p>Maintain stoppage of blood loss for 3-hours; achieve and maintain hemostasis throughout transport to surgical care in pre-clinical models.</p>
<p>Be administered at point-of-injury / pre-hospital treatment.</p>
<p>Be simple to use and does not require identification or direct access to source of hemorrhage.</p>
<p>Be a product that is less than 2-pounds; compatible with field use, compact, and lightweight.</p>
<p>Be easily, safely, and completely removed later in surgical settings.</p>
<p>The product developer intends to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance/approval for a technological solution intended to treat intracavitary noncompressible truncal hemorrhage.</p>
<p>The product developer shall provide the following research support services (tasks):</p>
<p>Pre-clinical or bench studies to support clearance/approval and military use of the solution.</p>
<p>Serve as the FDA sponsor.</p>
<p>Preparation and submission of applications and all documentation required for FDA clearance/approval.</p>
<p>Clinical studies to support clearance/approval and military use of the solution, in accordance with FDA regulations, International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, and all applicable DoD and Army regulations and policies.</p>
<p>Develop and prepare training program for end users that will meet FDA and U.S. Army requirements.</p>
<p>Manufacture and supply Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and FDA-compliant articles for clinical studies, and to support the DoD fielding strategy for the solution.</p>

<CONTACT>Johnny Montano, Contract Specialist, Phone 505-846-4579, Email johnny.montano@us.af.mil
<DESC><strong>Notice Type</strong>: Pre-Solicitation Notice, Surety, Survivability and Strategic Systems Assessment Support
<p><strong>NAICS Code</strong>: 541330 Engineering Services<br /><strong>Product/Service Code (PSC)</strong>: R425- Engineering and Technical Services</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>:</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) at Kirtland AFB to issue a sole source contract to the Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), Valencia Solutions, LLC, 805 Morningside Dr NE, Albuquerque, NM 87110, Cage code: 7EFX8 under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(5) as implemented by FAR 6.302-5(b)(7).</p>
<p>The scope of this acquisition includes support to the AFNWC in the following areas: contract program management, project-specific management, policy and guidance analysis, and recommendations in regards to strategic system capability assessments based on an established, demonstrated base of experience, electromagnetic pulse, and nuclear surety and certification as well as vulnerability analyses and assessments. (See attached Performance Work Statement). <br /><br />The contractor must have knowledge of and experience with the nuclear enterprise and must have executed Strategic System Capability Assessments (SSCA), Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) evaluations, and nuclear surety and certification analyses efforts, which contribute to major ACAT programs. Also, the contractor must have a full understanding and experience executing both the DoD's 5000 series and DOE's Phase 6.X acquisitions. Specifically, the contractor must have knowledge and experience in the integration of the DOE-owned systems with the DoD platform. Additionally, the contractor must have expertise in Vulnerability Modes and Effects Analyses (VMEA) of air-delivered nuclear weapon system life-cycle logistics, operations, and system analysis as well as Intercontinental Ballistic Missile and Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications lifecycle assessments. Specific expertise is related to weapon system logistics states such as transportation, storage, maintenance, and generation. Finally, specific expertise with DOE/DoD nuclear weapon systems command and control interface/designs. Overall, this acquisition requires expertise in the nuclear enterprise. <br /><br />The contractor must possess a Top Secret (TS) level facility clearance. All contractor employees must possess and maintain a TS security clearance. <br /><br />Market Research indicates that award to a new contractor would result in significant duplication of costs due to investments needed to gain a fundamental knowledge and understanding of the information/data already generated, required level of Subject Matter Expertise that can be dedicated to these efforts, and the learning curve to gain the capabilities to develop and execute the very unique and specific classified requirements in generating, validating, and testing VMEA and SSCA efforts. Based on this reasoning, there is only one WOSB contractor who is capable of performing the aforementioned follow-on DOE services without added investment and ramp-up time and costs, with the appropriate key personnel for the effort.<br /><br /><strong>Restrictions</strong>: AFNWC is authorized to exclude all foreign participation at the prime contractor level for subject procurement. Foreign participation is prohibited at the prime contractor level. U.S. based offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the PWS tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s). Offerors are advised FNs proposed to perform may be restricted under U.S. Export Control Laws due to the nature of the technical data.</p>
<p><strong>RESTRICTION ON PERFORMANCE BY FOREIGN CITIZENS</strong> (i.e., those holding non-U.S. Passports): This topic is "Export-controlled". The information and materials provided pursuant to or resulting from this topic are restricted under the ITAR, 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 - 130 or the EAR, 15 C.F.R. Parts 710 - 774. Foreign Citizens may perform work under an unclassified award resulting from this topic only if they are designated as a U.S. Person, as defined by 22 CFR &sect; 120.15, or if bidder is able to obtain an export license through the Department of State or Department of Commerce. Foreign Citizens designated as U.S. Persons are not permitted to perform work under a classified award. Foreign citizens will at no time be allowed to work on Air Force installations.<br /><br />This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Any information submitted by respondents is strictly voluntary. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are NOT considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. Respondents will not be notified individually of the results of any Government assessments. The Government may use the information obtained from responses to this notice in determining its acquisition approach, but the issuance of this notice does not restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this notice.<br /><br /><strong>Contracting office address</strong>:<br />1551 Wyoming Blvd SE <br />Kirtland AFB, NM 87117<br />United States</p>

<DESC><p>THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) USING MARKET RESEARCH AND WILL BE USED FOR INFORMATIONAL AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). THERE IS NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS<br />ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is issuing this Special Notice on behalf of the Amphibious Warfare Program Office (PMS377) to support the development of a potential future RFP for the FY17/19 Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) availabilities. The Government is conducting market research to gather comments and questions from Industry on the draft statement of work. The result of this market research will contribute to the continued development of the RFP. In the earlier Source Sought (N0002418SN005), Industry provided the Government input of a statement of capabilities and expected ability to meet LCAC SLEP scope.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>This Special Notice seeks input from interested parties capable of performing the scope of work under the LCAC SLEP program. LCAC are included in the US Munitions List and therefore subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations restrictions. Therefore, any interested parties must comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED SCOPE OF WORK:</p>
<p>The type of work to be accomplished includes repair and installation of hull structures, machinery, electrical systems, electronics, and piping systems. Integration of Government Furnished Property (GFP) (e.g. LCAC unique cable, the Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Navigation (C4N) suite and ETF40B gas turbine engines) into the craft utilizing a mature build-to-print Technical Data Package (TDP) is also required. The TDP consists of work items and associated drawings, test procedures, technical manuals, and a GFP list for each craft. Portions of this work will require an environmentally protected facility for the LCAC during the availability. If a future solicitation is eventually released, the future contract awardee would be responsible for performing this scope of work at Assault Craft Unit 4 (ACU 4), Joint Expeditionary Base, Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, VA or at the prospective Contractor's owned facility.<br /><br />REQUESTED INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The Government requests Interested Parties review the draft statement of work and provide questions or comments.</p>

<p>Issue Date: 22 DEC 2017 - Closing Date: 5 JAN 2018 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for acquisition of repair services, technical data, test standards, materials, and proprietary processes utilized for the repair of P-8A and EA-18G Radomes. The radomes included in the scope of this procurement include the 092-00644 series, 092-00645 series, 092-00646 series, 092-00647 series, 092-00663 series, 092-00664 series, 970-00704 series, and the 970-00705 series. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a sole source contract to the original equipment manufacturer of these items, Meggitt Polymers &amp; Composites, 3310 Carlins Park Drive, Baltimore MD 21042. This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is due to the fact that Meggitt proprietary materials, data, and processes are needed to support Fleet Support Team efforts and depot-level maintenance of the these P-8A and EA-18G radomes.</p>
<p>In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above. Companies with the capabilities and facilities to that would enable them to meet the Government's requirements may respond. Responses shall address how the respondent proposes to provide proprietary repair standards and technical data, expertise on proprietary repair processes, and repair services on the series of P-8A and EA-18G radomes identified in the paragraph above.</p>
<p>Responses shall include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution.</p>
<p>All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, and an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the requirement to have access to Meggitt proprietary processes, standards, and technical data.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number: N00164-18-S-NB37</p>
<p>Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements and can successfully offset the projected cost duplication and schedule delays. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM). Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts. This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Market Survey information may be submitted to the Point of Contact (POC) any time prior to the expiration of this announcement. The POC for this effort is Roger Brett roger.brett@navy.mil or 812-854-5269. The mailing address is:</p>

The Department assumes the role of mortgagee or lender when the borrower defaults on the loan. <br /><br />The Mortgage Loan Servicing (MLS) is for Conventional, Mark-to Market (M2M) and DEMO notes, property disposition portfolio services, as well as accounting services for all HUD-held notes. The work encompasses a broad but integrated set of functions for HUD-held notes and properties. MLS is a high priority and critical to the successful performance of mortgage loan servicing functions. MLS for mortgage and property servicing entails not only financial aspects of the HUD-held first, second and subordinate notes, mortgage portfolios and properties, but also requires response to a wide variety of incoming inquiries from HUD personnel, borrowers, auditors, billing agents, vendors attorneys and local taxing authorities. <br /><br />The period of performance is for a 6-month base period. The NAICS code is 522390 and the size standard is $20.5 million. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations. <br /><br />However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may submit a written response via email to Carmen Calloway at the email address below by 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time on January 2, 2017. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information received will be considered; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, HUD will proceed with the sole source award to Dynaxys LLC. The anticipated award date of this requirement is no later than January 7, 2018. No collect calls will be accepted. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact: Carmen.L.Calloway@hud.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT under authority of 41 U.S.C. 1901 and 3304, FAR 6.302-1, 13.106-1(b), and 13.501(a)(1)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The Agency intends to award a sole source contract to Cerulli Associates, 699 Boylston Street Boston, MA 02116, to procure services in support of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB). This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price contract with a period of performance of 12 months. The total contract cost is not to exceed $70,000.00.
<p>The procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541611.</p>

It provides unparalleled access to data that goes far beyond what's available in Cerulli publications. The tool is created by Cerulli and is the same tool that Cerulli analysts use to create charts and data for Cerulli publications.</p>
<p>The Cerulli publication provides important analysis on the defined contribution marketplace.  It gives the Agency a view into how its benefits, services and participant behaviors compare to other DC plans; provides information on market trends and basic market projections.  It is the only comprehensive research of this nature The Agency uses to benchmark the TSP against a broader market; maintain a current view of the issues, trends and activities taking place in the DC market.  The Agency utilizes this information to determine the strategic goals and business intelligence needs for the Agency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, access to Cerulli's Lodestar system will enable the Agency to incorporate large amounts of data into its own models.  Lodestar allows users to download current and historical data on retirement plan characteristics such as participant counts, plan features, and asset allocations.  By bringing this data into our models, the Agency will be able to continuously measure itself against the rest of the industry and take any necessary steps to ensure that it maintains its competitive advantage.</p>

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is issuing this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek participants to co-create, co-design, co-invest, and collaborate on research and development interventions to address development challenges for food and nutrition security in Asia .  USAID invites organizations and companies to submit an Expression of Interest, as provided below.
<p>The intent of the BAA is to allow co-creation and co-design to the maximum extent to create high quality, effective partnerships with great efficiency in time and resources.  USAID will invite selected for-profit and non-profit, public and private organizations, as detailed below, to co-create Research and Development (R&amp;D) solutions to the Problem and Challenge Statements stated in this BAA, including those organizations that have ideas, expertise, resources, and/or funding to add to potential solutions.</p>
<p>Co-Investing: USAID wants to align goals with the partners under this BAA, to facilitate shared responsibility, shared risk, and shared resourcing.  Shared resourcing requires that cash and other resources, both tangible and intangible, such as in-kind contributions, expertise, intellectual property, brand value, high-value coordination, and access to key people, places, and information, are directed towards reaching the solution to the Problem/Challenge. Co-investing does not require equal shared resources (such as 1:1 leverage), but rather resource contributions that are appropriate to the specific project's objectives, considering the comparative advantages brought by the participation of each party.</p>

<CONTACT>Ruggles, Susan
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to award a non-competitive, fixed price contract to NanoString Technologies, Inc., located in Seattle, WA. The USGS Leetown Science Center, based in Kearneysville, WV, has a requirement for a maintenance and service contract for the NanoString nCounter Sprint laboratory instrument.  The period of performance is a base year, plus three option years.  The NAICS code is 811219; this is not a small business set-aside.
NanoString Technologies Inc. is the only known source for a Sprint service contract because the instrument and supporting software are proprietary, as are the support services.  SOW attached.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1) Only One Source Reasonably Available.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation with capability statement no later than 01/05/2018 which shall be considered by the agency. THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  An award will be made on or about 01/31/2018.

Pursuant to FAR 5.102 Availability of Solicitations, the justification for other than full and open competition will be made available within 14 days after contract award.
Submissions or questions must be provided in writing to Susan Ruggles at sruggles@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to<br />CQ-Roll Call, Inc. for access to their CQ.com database. The vendor will provide 12 months of online access<br />to its Congressional documents database. The digital documents in the vendor's database include: full text of government documents, legislative summaries, committee coverage, vote analysis, congressional schedules, and CQ news and analysis. No competition is being sought. CQ's tracking tools are more numerous and diverse than other sources on the market. CQ's analysis appears alongside the actual legislative document text which means users do not have to attempt to follow legislation in multiple products-a feature not available in other known sources. CQ is a nationally recognized service provider used by Congress and other professionals worldwide to track U.S. legislation. It provides news articles and specialized reports, which other services do not. Without this capability in a single resource, HECSA Library would have to subscribe to multiple news and data providers to give users the same level of content.
<p>The period of performance is 12 months after the date of the award.</p>
<p>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2<br />Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. A solicitation will not be posted. However, any firm that believes it can<br />meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of publication of this<br />announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the<br />requirement. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the<br />proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends on proceeding with awarding a fixed price purchase order to ProQuest<br />LLC.</p>

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.<br />The Government will utilize a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) evaluation method for this requirement. Only those proposals determined to be Technically Acceptable will be eligible for award. Offerors whose technical proposals are determined "Unacceptable" will not be eligible for award. For a proposal to be determined "Technically Acceptable" and receive consideration for award based upon low price submitted, the proposal must receive a rating of "Acceptable" for all factor and sub-factors.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate the offer and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings</p>
<p>1. The adjectival ratings to be utilized for proposal evaluations are consistent with the DoD Source Selection Procedures and the Army Source Selection Supplement (AS3).

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k) (1) or (k) (2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k) (3) (i) of this clause.</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart<br />204.71 Of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br /><br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit price Amount<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Prior to submitting an agency protest, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve your concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.</p>

<DESC><p>Region 10 Law Enforcement Liaison (LEL)</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) whose primary mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce economic costs due to road traffic crashes, through education, research, safety standards, and enforcement activity.&nbsp; This is accomplished by setting and enforcing safety performance standards for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment as well as fuel economy standards, investigating safety defects in motor vehicles, conducting research on driver behavior and traffic safety, and providing grants to State and local governments to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NHTSA's Region 10, which includes Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington, requires assistance to secure and coordinate State Law Enforcement Liaison (LEL) activities and focus attention on NHTSA national priorities to secure the participation of law enforcement agencies within their States.&nbsp; State and local agencies are key to delivering highly visible and effective enforcement of traffic laws.&nbsp; To accomplish our mission, law enforcement agencies need to become familiar with NHTSA's priorities and programs and have the ability to seek out and obtain technical support.&nbsp; Regional LELs provide this type of support in concert with the National LEL Program and State efforts for the greatest consistency and continuity of effort.</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is to provide a Law Enforcement Liaison for Region 1 to offer technical assistance and support for traffic safety law enforcement outreach through coordination and cooperation with the National Law Enforcement Liaison funding and State LEL operations.&nbsp; The overall objective of the LEL program is the following:<br />&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li>Encouraging law enforcement agencies to implement and/or expand traffic safety enforcement, especially high visibility enforcement, across the year. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Encouraging agencies&nbsp;to improve their ability to plan and execute enforcement based on a data-driven approach of knowing where and when motor vehicle crashes and fatalities occur. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting States in organizing and conducting law enforcement-related events related to crackdowns and mobilizations at the State or local level</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining, compiling, and organizing data for presentation to NHTSA.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular reporting to the NHTSA Regional office and Headquarters on workload indicators and performance metrics established by the agreement with the contractor/LEL.</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: center;">Solicitation No.: 47PE0318R0001</div>
<div><br />This project consists of the repair and alteration of the FB/CH to achieve two primary construction areas which are the Capital Security Project (CSP) and Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) Relocation. These consist of the following:</div>
<div><br />Capital Security Project (CSP) Overview (BASE BID): Build enclosed judges&rsquo; parking area within existing vacant warehouse space, construct new elevator tower exterior of the existing 8-story courthouse tower removing storefront and two sections of precast spandrel panel on all floors from 3rd floor up to the parapet. Connect new elevators with existing building corridors. On tower 1st floor construct Clerk of Court File Room in vacant space off the existing elevator lobby. Upon completion of this new file room start 4-phase renovation on 6th floor for US Probation space. At northeast corner of the site build a free-standing 3,500 SF CSP Entrance Pavilion in an existing courtyard. The CSP Entrance Pavilion houses dual security stations for parallel screening of visitors by Court Security Officers (CSO) and Federal Protective Services (FPS). CSOs will screen visitors entering the tower housing the Courts and other tenants via the first floor connector. FPS will screen visitors entering the warehouse via the second floor connector. The first warehouse tenant will be MEPS but new connecting corridors and vertical circulation being built concurrently with the CSP Entrance Pavilion within the warehouse open a secure route to roughly 35,000 sf of vacant warehouse floor space that can then be rented upon completion of the work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) Relocation Project Overview (OPTION ONE): The Raleigh Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) processes applicants entering all branches of the military. The current MEPS location in Raleigh is being relocated to 24,500 SF on the mezzanine level of the warehouse. This tenant area is formed from 12,000 SF of existing mezzanine floor structure and 12,500 sf of new adjoining floor structure. The MEPS space is accessed by the public via the CSP Entrance Pavilion.&nbsp; The MEPS is an additive option due to its funding being provided by MEPS.</div>
<div><br />Probation Suite Wetrooms and Additional Rooms (OPTION TWO):&nbsp; The two restrooms and the break room on the 6th floor Probation suite are to be an additive option due to its funding being provided by the Courts.</div>
<div><br />The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to award a Design&shy;Bid-Build (DBB) Contract for the CAPITAL SECURITY PROJECT (CSP) &amp; US MILITARY ENTRANCE PROCESSING STATION (MEPS) RELOCATION PROJECT, RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA</div>

<div><br />No stipend is allocated for this project and will not be considered.</div>
<div><br />At the conclusion of this process, GSA intends to award a contract to a single Offeror for all all construction services.</div>
<div><br />This procurement is a full and open procurement which will be open to both large and small business firms. The firm (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable small business subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.7, as part of its proposal.</div>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.</p>
<p>Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

If the contract requires taking VA data to a contractor site and the data contains Personally Identifiable Information, the Contractor will provide an independent physical security assessment of their facility to the COTR prior to commencing work. General guidelines for physical security can be found in VA Directive 0730, Section 6 (Physical Security) and VA Memorandum (Subj: IT Oversight & Compliance Information Physical Security Assessments) dated October 24, 2007.

TRAINING

All Contractor and subcontractor personnel requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and networks:

Sign and acknowledge understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the National Rules of Behavior related to access to VA information and information systems, and Contractor Rules of Behavior (supplement),
Successfully complete VA Cybersecurity Awareness training and annual refresher training as required,
Successfully complete VA General Privacy training and annual refresher training as required,


and
d)   Successfully complete any additional cybersecurity or privacy training as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access.

The Contractor shall provide to the COTR a copy of the training certificates and signed Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within one week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. These online courses are located at  https://www.lms.va.gov/plateau/user/login.jsp.

Failure to complete this mandatory training within the timeframe required will be grounds for suspension or termination of all physical and/or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training is completed.

9.   CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY

All contract employees who require access to the VA site(s) and/or access to VA local area network (LAN) systems shall be the subject of a background investigation and must receive a favorable adjudication from the VA Security and Investigations Center (SIC). These requirements are applicable to all subcontractor personnel requiring the same NACI Background Investigation.

The level of background security investigation will be in accordance with VA Directive 0710 dated September 10, 2004 and is available at:  http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=85&Ftype=2.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION

The contract employee level of background investigation and clearance required for this effort is
NACI. Work may not commence until the appropriate background investigation has commenced.

Contractor Responsibilities

The Contractor shall bear the expense of obtaining background investigations. The cost of the background investigations is as follows: Low Risk (NACI) $230, Moderate Risk (MBI) $825, High Risk (BI) $3015. VA will pay for investigations processed through the VA SIC and conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in advance; however, the Contractor shall reimburse the full cost of background investigations to VA within 30 days of Bill of Collections from VA. VA shall send up to three plus one final delinquent notice to the Contractor. If the Contractor does not adhere to the Bill of Collections, future invoices may be subject to be offset by VA to recoup background investigation costs.
Immediately after contract or task order award, the Contractor must submit a completed Attachment D form (VBA Contractor Background Investigation Request Worksheet) for all contract employees working the contract, who have access to VA facilities, VA systems, or privacy data, to the COTR.
The Contractor and Contractor point of contact (POC) will receive an email notification from SIC identifying the website link that includes detailed instructions regarding completion of the background clearance application process and what level of background was requested. Reminder notifications will be sent if the complete package is not submitted by the due date.
The Contractor shall prescreen all personnel who require access to VA site(s) and/or access to VA LAN systems to ensure they maintain a U.S. citizenship or Alien Registration that authorizes them to work in the U.S. and are able to read, write, speak, and understand the English language.
Contractors who have current favorable background investigation conducted by OPM or Defense Security Service (DSS) may be accepted through reciprocation. However, it does not preclude the Contractor from submitting a completed Attachment D form


immediately after contract or task order award for all contract employees working the contract to the COTR.
Contract performance shall not commence before SIC confirmation that it received the investigative documents, that they are complete, and that the background investigation has begun. Once the Contractor s background investigation has been initiated, contract performance may commence. The COTR will notify and forward the Contractor a copy of the Certificate of Eligibility (form 4236) to the Contractor when the investigation has been favorably completed and adjudicated. The Contractor, if notified of an unfavorable adjudication by the Government, shall withdraw the employee from consideration from working under the contract. Failure to comply with the Contractor personnel security requirements may result in termination of the contract for default.
If the security clearance investigation is not completed prior to the start date of the contract, the contract employee may work on the contract with an initiated status while the security clearance is being processed. However, the Contractor will be responsible for the actions of those contract and subcontract employees they provide to perform work for VA. In the event damage arises from work performed by Contractor personnel, under the auspices of the contract, the Contractor will be responsible for resources necessary to remedy the incident.
Should the Contractor use a vendor other than OPM or DSS to conduct investigations, the investigative company must be certified by OPM/DSS to conduct Contractor investigations. The Vendor Cage Code number must be provided to the VA SIC, which will verify the information and conclude whether access to the Government s site(s) and/or VA LAN systems can be.
The investigative history for Contractor personnel working under this contract must be maintained in the databases of either OPM or the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO).

Government Responsibilities

After the COTR has received Attachment D form(s) from the Contractor, SIC will send an e-mail notification to the Contractor and their POC identifying the website link that includes detailed instructions regarding completion of the background clearance application process and what level of background was requested. SIC will also send reminder notifications to the Contractor and their POC if the complete package is not submitted by the due date.

Upon receipt of required investigative documents, SIC will review the investigative documents for completion and initiate the background investigation by forwarding the investigative documents to OPM to conduct the background investigation. If the investigative documents are not complete, SIC will return the package to the Contractor with corrective instructions.

VA will pay for investigations processed through the VA SIC and conducted by OPM in advance; however, the Contractor shall reimburse the full cost of background investigations to VA within 30 days of Bill of Collections from VA. VA shall send up to three plus one final delinquent notice to the Contractor. If the Contractor does not adhere to the Bill of Collections, future invoices may be subject to be offset by VA to recoup background investigation costs and may be considered grounds for default.

The COTR will notify and forward the Contractor a copy of the Certificate of Eligibility (form 4236) when the investigation has been favorably completed and adjudicated. The COTR will also notify the Contractor of an unfavorable adjudication by the Government.

H.  CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE

It is agreed that:

The preliminary and final deliverables and all associated working papers, application source
code, and other material deemed relevant by the VA which have been generated by the contractor in the performance of this task order are the exclusive property of the U.S. Government, and shall be submitted to the COTR at the conclusion of the task order.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p><br /><strong>Synthetic Training Environment Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainers and Global Terrain/One World Terrain Request for White Paper</strong><br /><br /><br /><em>Administrative Notes</em>: <br /><br /><em>Per Request for White Paper (RWP) Amendment dated December 20, 2017, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the deadline for White Paper responses has been extended to January 05, 2018</span></strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>Please note, the official document of record is the formal posting and the related attachments. The information reflected within the Track Changes feature should not be utilized as the formal source for changes related to an amendment/modification.</em></p>
<p><em>The Government's responses to questions received from Industry are included as attachments to this posting. Question Set 1 of 1 was included as a RWP attachment on December 14, 2017. Question Set 2 of 2 was included as a RWP&nbsp;attachment on December 22, 2017.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br />Request for White Paper (Updated December 22, 2017): <br /></span></p>
<p>1.0 Objective: This Request for White Paper (RWP) is issued to request Industry response in support of the initial development and technology assessment for the Synthetic Training Environment (STE), the Army's next generation immersive capability.</p>
<p>The objective of this effort is to design, develop, and demonstrate Global Terrain/One World Terrain (OWT) capability that supports both semi-immersive and virtual immersive capabilities for reconfigurable air and ground trainers no later than July of 2018.</p>
<p>2.0 Summary: U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Combined Arms Center for Training (CAC-T), is seeking a comprehensive technology solution for reconfigurable virtual collective trainers that operate on a common Global Terrain/One World Terrain capability as part of the initial development for STE.</p>
<p>The current Integrated Training Environment (ITE) Training Aids, Devices, Simulators, and Simulations (TADSS) are mainly facilities based and lack global terrain capability. Current capabilities do not allow units to expediently conduct training at the Point of Need (PoN) where they can train on the terrain they will fight on. Furthermore, current ITE TADSS lack the ability to allow units and Soldiers to conduct scalable, repetitive, realistic, multi-echelon, collective training, seamlessly from anywhere in the world, and require significant training overhead (time, money, people) to utilize.</p>
<p>The Army seeks a simulation training capability that allows formations to conduct collective, combined arms maneuver training from squad through platoon level for all Army component formations that sufficiently represents platform capabilities. The training capability must accurately represent vehicle systems (e.g., sensors, weapons, survivability capabilities, and communications) and represents platform natural fields of view. At a minimum, this training capability must provide two transportable and reconfigurable trainers capable of training all Army aviation assets (AH-64, UH-60, CH-47) to include Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) assets and non-rated crew member capabilities. At a minimum, the training capability must also provide two transportable and reconfigurable trainers capable of training all Army ground combat maneuver assets (Bradley, Abrams and STRYKER series) and wheeled vehicle assets (HMMWV, HEMMT, JLTV).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Army seeks a semi-immersive, Training Simulation for Soldiers that is a scalable training capability that represents dismounted Soldiers from squad through platoon. This training simulation must be transportable, represent infantry squad organic weapon systems, and use the same common synthetic environment as the virtual collective trainers.</p>
<p>In addition to the reconfigurable trainers identified above, the Army seeks a terrain capability that provides a fully accessible representation of the globe upon a WGS-84 global simulation runtime. The objective capability must be accessible through the Army networks and demonstrate the ability to support use cases from the cloud. The capability must support downloadable high resolution localized terrain insets. This terrain capability must be useable by all simulation trainers and be initiated from the STE training simulation software. This capability must represent the complexities of the Operational Environment and the multi-domain battlefield (including air, land [dense urban terrain], maritime, space, and the information environment. This capability must provide terrain capability that is exportable, reusable and in runtime 3D formats.</p>
<p>The attached Request for White Paper Technical Supplement included with this announcement provides detailed, end-state, technical outcomes desired by the Government. Minimum requirements for solutions proposed in response to this request are further described below and do NOT include all items listed within the aforementioned attachment. A specification sheet related to the minimum model standard and performance thresholds has also been provided with this announcement as an attachment.</p>
<p>To address the capability gaps described above, the Government must pursue an agile development process in order to evaluate the utility of particular technologies, complete with test, evaluation, and demonstration considerations. Through experimentation, solution refinement, and multiple technology assessments, the Government will be better postured to inform future requirements and further increase mission effectiveness. Army Contracting Command-Orlando (ACC-ORL), on behalf of CAC-T, will facilitate a prototype project in support of the subject need using Other Transaction processes in accordance with 10 U.S. Code &sect; 2371b. The subject request, and any resultant agreement(s), are generally not subject to procurement laws or the Federal Acquisition Regulations.</p>
<p>The Government intends to downselect from the submittals received in response to this request for subsequent User Assessments in March and July of 2018. Respondents' must be prepared to demonstrate their technology in accordance with the objectives below.</p>
<p><br />3.0 User Assessment Objectives:</p>
<p>If a White Paper response is deemed favorable and selected by the Government, subsequent User Assessments will occur in both March and July of 2018. The Government anticipates additional User Assessments occurring beyond July of 2018 to further inform the requirement and assess capabilities of the solution. Details regarding those future assessments and correlating funding&nbsp;will be dependent on the outcome of User Assessment 2.</p>
<p>The intent of the March 2018 User Assessment (UA1) is to evaluate the viability of proposed White Paper approach through demonstrated implementation, representative user operation, and vulnerability assessment scans. A government safety release of potential solutions will occur during UA1, this review will occur on-site after vendor set-up. At this time, the Government will assess the solution's potential of meeting the minimum requirements of the assessment anticipated to occur in July 2018. Upon conclusion of UA1, the Government may elect to no longer pursue a particular technology or proposed solution.</p>
<p>The intent of the July 2018 User Assessment (UA2) is to evaluate the progress of the proposed solution since UA1. During this assessment, contractors must demonstrate the following minimum capabilities within a closed network, and exhibit a firm understanding of the required development needed to support the tasks below:</p>
<p>A. Global Terrain/One World Terrain: A low-resolution depiction of the globe will be accepted, however, at least one high resolution terrain box must be demonstrated.</p>
<p>B. Reconfigurable Virtual Trainers: <br /><br />i. Two fully immersive Ground Trainers and two fully immersive Air Trainers must be available for use. <br /><br />ii. A semi-immersive training capability that trains dismounted Soldiers. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At a minimum</span>, nine semi-immersive dismounted trainers must be provided.</p>
<p>Note: Additional technical details regarding the identified capabilities are provided within the attached Request for White Paper Technical Supplement included with this announcement. Contractors are strongly encouraged to exceed the minimum objectives identified.</p>
<p>C. Although described in the attached technical supplement, the following requirements are not mandatory for UA2:</p>
<p>- Interoperability with LVC-IA<br />- Risk Management Framework Compliance<br />- Ability to meet all Cybersecurity Standards<br />- Complete Training Simulation Software<br />- Ability to exchange data with Army, Joint and Unified Action Partners Mission Command Information Systems</p>
<p><br />4.0 White Paper Response Requirements</p>
<p>Respondents shall detail precisely how each of the UA2 Objectives identified above will be met through their solution. A holistic solution is preferred, however, solutions only addressing specific elements of the need will be accepted. If the proposed solution is not comprehensive and does not meet all requirements, the response shall clearly state which specific capabilities from the outlined objectives and White Paper Technical Supplement can be fully met. If the proposed solution will not be ready for a user assessment by July of 2018, the response shall clearly state when the User Assessment objectives can be met. <br /><br />In addition to a description of the technical solution, respondents must also:<br /><br />A. Articulate a strategy to achieve RMF Compliance (post-July 2018), and include a description of network (bandwidth and latency) utilization and constraints.<br /><br />B. Identify all hardware, software, technical documentation, and cyber security testing documentation that validates how the solutions meets, or will meet, cyber security requirements.<br /><br />C. Provide confirmation (with supporting rationale) that the Modular Open System Architecture proposed will be interoperable with current Live Virtual Constructive - Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA). **No longer required per 14 Dec 2017 RWP Amendment. However, respondents should be cognizant of this eventual need and are encouraged to acknowledge within their responses that this is still a long-term aspect of the STE vision**<br /><br />D.

<p>Q1. On Page 3 of 64, para. 21 of the above Sol. it states "Access to DLA EMALL is not authorized" Is this a<br />correct statement, or, is this statement an accidental carry over from a previous requirement? Please verify.</p>
<p>A1: The statement is correct that "Access to DLA EMALL is not authorized".</p>
<p>Q2. DMWR-1-4140-228 Dated June 20th 2012, page 3-5 contains a table named "Serial numbers of Axial Fans with Shafts to be Replaced". This Table lists approximately 156 Serial Numbered Fans. It has been noted that 14 years ago these same Serial Numbers were also listed in what was the current DMWR then. My question is does the US Army have any way of determining how many of these SN's have had the Shafts changed in these 14 Years ? Is there any more current SN Data available considering how dated this information is?</p>
<p>A2: DMWR-1-4140-228 dated 20 June 2012 has been updated as of 30 June 2017. The 2017 DMWR version possess the current list of serial numbered axial fans with shafts to be replaced in Table 2 of Preshop Analysis.</p>

<DESC><p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons is seeking concerns having the ability for providing Residential Reentry center (RRC) services (in-house RRC beds) and Home Confinement services (home confinement placements) for male and female Federal offenders held under the authority of United States Statutes located in Brooklyn, NY (Located within either Kings County or Queens County).</p>
<p><br />Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, May, 2015" (see attached). Home Confinement services (for home confinement placements) are specifically defined in chapter 10, programs, of the aforementioned SOW. Additional requirements for these services are referenced throughout the SOW as well.</p>
<p>This will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract for services with a one year base period, and four one-year options periods.<br /><br />The RRC In-House requirement for Line Item One (1) will consist of a 100 bed facility in which 87 beds will be designated for males and 13 beds designated for female.

<DESC>SINGLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT

1.	Introduction/Statement of Intent
The FAA provides notice of intent to procure WAAS Signal-in-Space Signal Generator (SIGGEN) in a single source acquisition. The FAA intends to award this requirement to Novatel.

2.	Description of Supplies/Services
This acquisition is for a technical refresh of the existing signal generator (SIGGEN) for use in the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).  The primary function of the SIGGEN is to generate L1 and L5 signals for transmission from a Geosynchronous Uplink Subsystem (GUS) site to a WAAS GEO satellite.  The SIGGEN takes a stream of WAAS broadcast messages containing navigation data (in accordance with RTCA/DO-229), encodes and CDMA modulates the data and transmits it on a 70 MHz IF PSK modulated carrier for subsequent uplink to the WAAS GEO.  In addition to the fundamental encoding and modulation functions, the SIGGEN also makes precision adjustments to the code rate and the carrier frequency in response to real-time commands received from an external interface.  These code rate and carrier frequency adjustments are made in order to compensate for satellite motion (Doppler), ionospheric distortion, satellite frequency translation errors, and other impairments.  This is done so that the resulting downlink L1 and L5 carriers are coherent (code-carrier; carrier-carrier) and can be used as a ranging source as well as a data link source of navigation messages.
The candidate SIGGEN is desired to be a functional replacement for the existing product and therefore must satisfy significant compatibility requirements such that integration efforts are minimized and L1/L5 signal generation performance is maintained based upon the functional requirements described in Attachment (a).  The envisioned end state for this effort would be production of approximately 40 SIGGENs and life cycle support for a minimum of ten years after first production unit delivery.  Life cycle support for the SIGGEN includes but is not limited to repair of failed units, firmware upgrades, and monitoring of subsystem obsolescence. 

3.	Total Estimated Value and Period of Performance
The total estimated contract value will be $3,000,000 with a two-year period of performance after award. 
    
4.	Authority
Authority for single source procurement is provided by AMS policy section 3.2.2.4. 

5.	Reasons for Single Source
The FAA requires new SIGGENs by 2019 to support the development of GEO 7.  Given the uncertainties with an entirely new development, the approach would result in a high risk that FAA would not be able to meet significant government furnished equipment requirements that will be in the Future GEO 7 contract.

6.	Questions
A competitive solicitation is not available in lieu of the sole source intended contract. State to whom, how (by e-email and/or letter), and by what deadline any questions about.

<DESC><strong><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Polaris Status Update, 22 December 2017<br /><br /></span></strong>The purpose of this notification is to provide an update to industry regarding NGA's future procurement strategy for the acquisition, adoption, integration, and deployment of high priority IT services for Electronic Light Table (ELT) Services, Structured Observation Management (SOM), Foundation GEOINT (FG) Modernization, and Controlled Imagery Production Environment (CIPE) requirements.&nbsp; NGA previously informed industry that the acquisition titled "Polaris" would deliver these capabilities.&nbsp; NGA has since revised its acquisition strategy and the acquisition titled "Polaris" will no longer exist.<br /><br />The revised acquisition strategy includes three (3) key elements: (1) an eXploit follow-on contract (eXploit-2) for the ELT and SOM user interface requirements (RFI released 20 October 2017).&nbsp; (2) a modular contracting approach scoped for development and delivery of specific capabilities or services to further modernize FG production.&nbsp; The modular contracting approach will capitalize on procurement flexibilities such as, but not limited to: single awards through competition; multiple awards through competition which may further lead to "bake off" of delivered capabilities; sole source procurements; use of other government vehicles such as BPAs, GWACs, GSA, E-SITE, etc.; and/or in limited circumstances, delivery of a capability or service by the operations and sustainment (O&amp;S) contractor referenced in (3) below.&nbsp; The specific procurement approach for each modular contract will be determined on a case-by-case basis, will be based on the specific development need, and will each be appropriately synopsized.&nbsp; (3) a task order under E-SITE for integration and O&amp;S of FG Modernization and CIPE capabilities previously developed under eXploit and new FG capabilities developed elsewhere on the modular development contracts.<br /><br />Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) may occur prior to contract award, during contract performance, or as a result of established subcontract or other organizational relationships.&nbsp; To address industry's OCI concerns, NGA will analyze individual acquisitions to identify and evaluate potential OCI as early in the acquisition process as possible; and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate significant potential conflicts before contract award.<br /><br />The solicitation for integration and O&amp;S efforts for FG and CIPE is estimated to be released to E-SITE vendors in February 2018.&nbsp; The structure, scope, and timeline of the modular development contracts are still in the planning stages.&nbsp; NGA/TI will continue to develop the requirements and conduct market research for these acquisitions.&nbsp; NGA will communicate regularly with Industry as decisions are made concerning individual efforts formerly under Polaris.<br /><br />Depending upon the security classification and acquisition strategy of particular modular requirements, NGA/OCSA will issue fair opportunity notices or post additional information on the FedBizOpps (FBO), UNCLASSIFIED Acquisition Resource Center (ARC), CLASSIFIED ARC, and/or GSA Advantage! e-Buy websites when available.&nbsp; Prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring the FBO, NGA Business Opportunities Reports on the ARC, and/or GSA websites for the release of any additional details or information as it becomes available.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br />Polaris Status Update, 29 June 2017</span>
<p>The Government greatly appreciates the time and effort spent by Industry responding to the two RFIs associated with Polaris.  At this time, the Government is taking a strategic pause with respect to Polaris to fully consider the feedback and recommendations submitted by Industry, NGA mission needs, and to review the future scope of the requirement.

<p>Original Sources Sought Notice, Request for Information (RFI) 1, 23 March 2017</p>
ethodology, and process for the agile software development of multiple systems, domains, applications, and data repositories spanning multiple portfolios. This RFI is a technique to conduct market research and may result in revisions to the Government's requirements documents and acquisition strategy for any future solicitation, based upon industry responses.
<p><br />The Office of Contract Services (OCS) is conducting market research for a new requirement called Polaris to support the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA) Adopt and Deliver Group (TI). TI expedites the acquisition, adoption, integration, and deployment of Information Technology (IT) services to enable the community wide adoption of Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) in support of NGA's GEOINT CONOPS 2022. The Polaris contract vehicle will develop GEOINT capabilities and deliver interoperable cloud-based GEOINT services to the NGA, Intelligence Community (IC), and international partners. The contract will support NGA's transition from systems to services, and from organizational specific to operating and sharing in the cloud. An emphasis will be rapid development of capabilities using open source software first, and avoiding end-to-end closed system unless proprietary software brings exceptional or unique value to NGA.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates award of a multiple award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle with an extended ordering period (base period and annual option periods).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 - Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued under the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. <br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-95 effective 1/19/2017.<br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325120 with a small business size standard of 1,000 Employees. This acquisition is being procured as a Total Small Business Set Aside. Only quotes submitted by qualified small business concerns will be considered.<br /><br />Delivery<br />The 1000L microbulk Ar tank shall be delivered, installed and filled no later than 10 days after the date of award. The items shall be shipped F.O.B. Destination to: <br />NIST Charleston Laboratory<br />Hollings Marine Laboratory<br />331 Ft. Johnson Rd. <br />Charleston, SC 29412<br /><br />FOB DESTINATION MEANS: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.<br /><br />EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD<br />The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Contractor whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is the lowest price, technically acceptable quotation.<br />Technically acceptable means that the Contractor provides a microbulk Ar tank and Argon that meets the requirements specified in the Statement of Work, and the requirements of all Line Items and option years. If a Contractor does not indicate how its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.  A top and bottom fill piping circuit is required to maintain gas line pressure and eliminate the need to install and use backup high pressure argon cylinders during liquid fill events. Contractors that propose to provide any tank solution that requires the use of backup, high pressure argon cylinders to avoid the requirement to provide a new tank equipped with a top and bottom fill piping circuit will be rejected as unacceptable.  <br /><br />Price will be evaluated to determine that total price is consistent with the technical portion of the quotation and is a fair and reasonable overall price to the Government.<br />NIST intends to evaluate quotes and issue a contract based on the initial quotes received. Therefore, the Contractor's initial quote should contain the Contractor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. NIST reserves the right to request revised quotes from, or negotiate final contract terms with, one or more, but not all, Contractors if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.<br /><br />REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS<br />All Contractors shall submit the following:<br />1. For the purpose of evaluation of Technical Acceptability: Documentation that confirms the contractor is capable of providing the supplies specified in the statement of work.
<p>2. Contractors shall provide pricing for the following line items and option years.<br />Base Year: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Line Item 1: Required Specifications for Liquid Argon:<br />Critical Assay-99.999%<br />Meets ICP-MS Specification<br />Oxygen-&lt; 2 ppm<br />Total Hydrocarbons (as CH4)-&lt; 0.5 ppm<br />Nitrogen-&lt; 10 ppm <br />Carbon Dioxide-&lt; 0.5 ppm<br />Water-&lt; 5 ppm<br />Carbon Monoxide-&lt; 0.5 ppm <br />Hydrogen-&lt; 2 ppm <br />Valve Material-Solid Brass and Stainless Steel are acceptable<br />Line Item 2: Delivery Requirements and Minimum Tank Levels.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not let the microbulk tank deplete (become empty). To prevent depletion of the argon product, the tank shall be outfitted with a wireless telemetry system that communicates with the Contractor and notifies the Contractor that the tank needs to be filled. The Contractor shall provide and maintain a working telemetry system for the tank. If the telemetry system fails or is out of order, it shall be repaired or replaced by the Contractor as outlined in Section I. Gas delivery orders shall be called in by phone when repairs are delayed.<br />The following minimum levels shall be maintained at all times for the microbulk Tank: 20% of the total capacity.<br />Option Year I: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Option Year II: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Option Year III: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Option Year IV: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />3. A completed version of all required solicitation provisions (see attached provisions/clauses document - required submissions highlighted in blue).</p>
<p><br />4. If the contractor objects to any of the terms and conditions contained in this solicitation, the contractor shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:" [Contractor shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)]. It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to identify in their quote any exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. If the contractor does not include such a statement, the submission of a quotation in response to this solicitation will be regarded as the Contractor's acceptance of the Government's terms and conditions for inclusion into the resultant purchase order.<br /><br />5. Contractors shall provide an active DUNS # for the System for Award Management (SAM) registration.<br /><br />6. If the Contractor's representations and certifications in SAM.gov do not reflect the NAICS code governing this solicitation, Contractors must submit documentation that they are a small business under the NAICS code governing this solicitation.<br />Please note that this procurement IS NOT being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If a contractor submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation;<br /><br />DUE DATE FOR QUOTATIONS<br />All quotations must be submitted via e-mail to Wendy Paulo, Contracting Officer at Wendy.Paulo@nist.gov.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent from the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, to issue cost type/fixed type contracts on an other than full and open competition basis, with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, San Diego, CA to provide a quantity of 40 MQ-8C Endurance Upgrade aircraft through FY2022. PMA-266 has received authorization to increase the quantity from an initial 28 aircraft due to the transition from being classified as a Rapid Deployment Capability to a Program of Record. Northrop Grumman is the sole developer and manufacturer of the current MQ-8B VTUAV system, as well as the MQ-8C Endurance Upgrade, aircraft. Accordingly, Northrop Grumman is the only firm able to meet this requirement as the Government does not own the technical data required to compete this requirement without incurring substantial duplication of costs. Small businesses interested in subcontracting possibilities may contact Northrop Grumman, Ms. Vicki Harper-Hall, at (310) 331 3824. This synopsis is for informational purposes only.

<DESC>Synopsis: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) Portland District intends to solicit construction firms who are interested in submitting a competitive firm-fixed price proposal for this project. This announcement is for the upgrade of existing attic access of Bonneville Powerhouse 1 located at Bonneville Dam.
<p>Project Scope: The current access in the attic to service electrical and mechanical installations is limited by the existing catwalk placement. The existing catwalks were constructed with a low top guardrail and no intermediate guardrail which does not comply with the current International Building Code (IBC) and federal regulations. The governing code requires a top guardrail height of 42 inches and an intermediate guardrail height, such that a 21 inch diameter maximum sphere cannot pass-through. Currently, there is no intermediate guardrail. The installation of additional catwalk branches provide access to required /needed locations and will allow efficient and safe use by personnel to perform maintenance tasks.</p>
<p>Construction will be accomplished by staging pre-assembled catwalk sections, guardrail extension sections, beams and miscellaneous metals at selected locations on mobile platforms on the powerhouse floor. Construction elements will be lifted into the attic through the existing ceiling access panel &lsquo;trap door'. Allowance for improving the material handling system at the "trap door" has been included in the project with a Bonneville Dam First Powerhouse (BN1) Personnel Safety Improvements trolley beam, hoist, and extension to deliver lifted items to the floor grating level and roof truss lower chord. Additional floor grating will be provided around the trap door to create a larger material handling area. Additional floor grating will also be provided in areas where plywood has been placed by the Bonneville maintenance team. This will provide the contractor additional work space and tool storage. The grating will be left in place for use by the Bonneville maintenance team after construction. Construction will be accomplished with bolted and clamped connections. No steel welding or burning will be done in the attic. Steel cutting will be accomplished mechanically in the attic on existing catwalk framing only where necessary. Lead paint safety provisions will be addressed in the technical specifications. New catwalk support beams, longer than 12' will be placed by splicing two structural members. This will assist in material handling and distribution while allowing safer construction in the attic.</p>
<p>Construction duration is anticipated to take eight months. Construction is to occur as one continuous project with no significant interruptions.</p>
<p>Acquisition Strategy: The solicitation will be a request for proposal (RFP). The Lowest Price Technically Acceptable source selection process will be used to evaluate proposals. Evaluation criteria will be stated in the RFP. The Government will include options in the RFP. This acquisition will result in a single fixed-price contract.</p>
<p>Magnitude of Construction: The estimated cost of the project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>Set Asides and Codes: This is a small business set-aside acquisition. This effort is classified through the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) under code 237990 - Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The FSC is Z2KA - Repair or Alteration of Dams.</p>
System for Award Management (SAM): Offerors must register in the SAM at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ prior to submission of proposals and prior to receiving an award.
<p>Point of Contact: The USACE-NWP Contracting Office will be the sole point of contact for this action. E-mail responses to the Primary Point of Contact, Thomas J. Cohick at thomas.j.cohick@usace.army.mil. E-mail is the preferred method for receiving responses to this solicitation.</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THIS SOLICITATION EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOLICITATION OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUEST.</p>
