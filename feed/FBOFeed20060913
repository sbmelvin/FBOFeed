A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation is available.

http://www.arnet.gov/far/farqueryframe.html. 52.204-7. Central Contractor Registration. (Oct 2003) Alternate I (Oct 2003). (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. Alternate I (Oct 2003).  As prescribed in 4.1104(a), substitute the following paragraph (b) for paragraph (b) of the basic clause: (b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the CCR database by December 31, 2003.  The Contractor shall maintain registration during performance and through final payment of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of the SF 30, Amendment of solicitation/Modification of Contract, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the Contractor's name and address exactly as stated in this contract. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the Contractor is registered in the CCR database. Quotes shall include a total price for each of the two items. Quotes are due by close of business 03/20/06 at the SW Idaho/Nevada Acquisition Center, 1249 S. Vinnell Way, Ste 200, Boise, Idaho 83709. FAX quotes will be accepted at 208-373-4197.

The Government intends to award this effort to Radiance Technologies, Inc., as a modification to existing Contract DASG60-00-C-0078 due to their demonstration of a unique capability and proprietary tools to provide the particular research serv ices of highly specialized services.  Under Contract DASG60-00-C-0078, Radiance Technologies currently analyzes, assesses and recommends the most effective means to leverage space and missile defense capabilities; providing unique technical and programmati c support to a variety of USASMDC technology programs.  The period of performance is through August 2007, beginning upon award under existing Contract DASG60-00-C-0078, to which the instant effort will be added by modification.

<DESC>The Department of Defense requires this effort for preparation, testing and assessment of existing, contractor developed, solid state laser (SSL) gain media. This additional effort is being executed by SMDC to augment the Joint High Power Solid State  Laser (J-HPSSL) Program with the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office.   As the designer/developer of the Raytheon JHPSSL concept, only Raytheon has the expertise, hardware, and facilities to perform the characterization effort and support the perfor mance measurement and technical assessment of this particular SSL device.  This effort requires the contractors PC-MOPA laboratory facilities and personnel to conduct the effort.  Award to any other source would require the assumption of design and config uration control and require a significant level of effort to absorb an acceptable level of design knowledge, resulting in substantial duplication of costs to the Government.  The period of performance is one year, beginning upon award under existing Contra ct DASG60-03-C-0018, to which the instant effort will be added by modification.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to the U. S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, P.O.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to issue a solicitation for the design-build of a new facility and infrastructure.  DOE requires building facilities and infrastructure to be constructed at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) 510 Security Gate, currently located 1Â½ miles north of US 95 at Lathrop Wells. A design-build, construction project is anticipated with an estimated price range between $5M - $10M. The construction period is expected to last 180 calendar days. This requirement will be a competitive, 100% small business set-aside.  The resultant award is expected to be a firm-fixed price contract. The design-build construction to be procured is classified in the North American Industry Classification System code 236220 with a size standard of $28.5M. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available through the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) on or about April 17, 2006 under RFP Number DE-RP28-06RW12369.  You may register and access the IIPS system at http://e-center.doe.gov.  The RFP will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.500 and 5.102(a)(1), therefore, hard copies will not be provided. There will not be any printed or hard copies of the RFP mailed. Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the RFP. NOTE: The RFP will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders list.  It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in rejection of the same. Please submit by March 31, 2006, an e-mail to rosa_gomez@ymp.gov referencing the anticipated RFP Number and project title if you intend to propose. This e-mail should also include your companyâ€™s name and information (i.e. address, phone number) and a statement of qualifications in design-build construction. This information will only be used to determine the magnitude of interested parties.

The National Park Service (NPS) intends to award up to two concession contracts for guided interpretive hiking services for the public within the Kantishna area and limited opportunities in the Wonder Lake area of Denali National Park and Preserve.  The proposed contracts will have a term of January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2016.

The solicitation, selection and award of the concession contract will be conducted pursuant to 36 CFR Part 51. In addition, the NPS has determined that Denali National Park Wilderness Centers, Ltd. is a historical operator eligible to be awarded a concession contract.  This contract will be awarded pursuant to section 1307 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, 16 USC 3197 and 36 CFR 13.80-13.82.

The Department of the Air Force, Space and Missile System Center (SMC) intends to issue a sole source contract to complete the Science & Technology and Modeling, Simulation & Assessment tasks already in progress to Sparta.  This contract is valued at approximately $644,000.  The period of performance is approximately 6 months.  This task requires an intimate and detailed knowledge of the existing tasks being completed by Sparta, who has been working these efforts since the inception of these tasks.  

This work will involve Sparta completing the following 10 high priority-upgrades into SEAS 3.7:
1)	Perform analysis, design acquisitions, prototyping, development and testing of software.  Support, sponsor, attend, and participate in internal and external briefings and meetings.
2)	Develop and deliver significant upgrades and modifications of SEAS software source code to prove added capabilities as well as improved performance.
3)	Develop and deliver significant upgrades and modifications to the SEAS Graphical User Interfaces.  Define, design and implement and document upgrades to the GUI and/or server client relational database for inclusion of new tools, data types, and information fusion.
4)	Update both on-line and off-line SEAS supporting documentation to appropriate commercial software product standards.
5)	Integrate the SEAS upgrades to run on common threats, environments, timelines, and output interfaces.
6)	Assist in defining, planning, developing, and analyzing system development and/or operational tests and evaluations. 
7)	Provide configuration management support as required to SEAS Configuration Control Board (CCB).
8)	Provide support for a VV&A program for the SEAS model in support of efforts to make it an industry and government standard.
9)	Develop a SEAS website to provide the latest information on SEAS news versions to the user community.
10)	 Develop and build SEAS training programs.  Develop and provide appropriate training materials for managers, entry-level analysts, and advanced analysts.

These listed tasks require government review and testing before acceptance.  If there are problems, Sparta still must be on the contract to correct these issues.  Completion of the documentation and SEAS 3.7 release is required on or before 30 November 2006.  

Planning, engineering, and analytical support are all consolidated under this effort by Sparta.  This effort does and will consist of expansion of engineering efforts, briefings, conferences, document reviews, software/hardware development, risk reduction tasks which consists of prototyping, demonstrations and experiments.  In addition research analysis and development are required to assess concept maturity that is sufficient to determine if it can become a DARPA seedling or TACSAT demo.  This task consists of building 2 additional conformal flat tanks, 4 specialty designed corner pieces and several honeycomb panels for the purpose of base plates/overheads and side panels.  Sparta is currently supporting this effort.

Sparta will continue to support the Responsive Strike Command and Control Experiment (RSC2E) and various aspects of Space Architectures to facilitate defining the space nodes within the C2 Constellation.  The contractor is producing architectures that illustrate and define operational, system and technical views of interrelationships that comprise the increasingly complex set of DOD?s air, land, sea, and space-based capabilities.  Sparta has worked closely with SMC, AFSPC, 14th Air Force and USSTRATCOM in development of an Enabling Concept Document for responsive strike command and control.  Sparta will continue its support of the C2 integrated product team.

The following 3 tasks still need to be completed.
1)	Finalize the system-view architecture documents.
2)	Coordinate final architectures with Electronic Systems Center and USSTRATCOM.
3)	Integrate final architecture.
Sparta exclusively has an abundance of knowledge on this subject matter due to their past work with SMC/XD on Command and Control architectures.

Any persons or companies interested in this notice are to respond to the requirements and submit their capabilities and qualifications statement to the PCO.  The Capabilities Statement should state why the company believes a sole source is invalid.  The capability and qualifications statement will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government and will be coordinated between the PCO and the Functional Area Evaluator for technical merit.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  (i) Technical Capability of proposed item to meet the requirement, (ii) Past Performance, (iii) Price Offerors’ proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria. Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.   Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors(ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is significantly less important that Factor (iii) PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.

Offerors’ technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.

Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.   ( c ) Offeror’s Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors-Commerical Items, Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.   Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.   Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror’s proposal which has no relevant past  performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the government and thus, may be unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.   The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror’s Past Performance as follows:    NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.  OUTSTANDING:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror’s past performance.   SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror’s past performance.   MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror’s past performance.

SubSkillsNet is a family of part-task trainers under development at NAVAIR Orlando TSD that focus on tactics, navigation and piloting, collision avoidance, classification of sonar contact information and contact target motion analysis (TMA).  Each trainer is designed to run individually as a single task trainer or networked with other SubSkillsNet trainers to provide a low-cost team training capability. There are currently over two-dozen unique applications that have been delivered to the fleet. 
    	
The SubSkillsNet product line has been ongoing since 1997.  During this timeframe, it has been receiving periodic updates to incorporate improved and new capabilities. NAVAIR Orlando TSD has identified an ongoing requirement for the continued development of new and related products. These products fall into the SubSkillsNet family including the Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT) and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

A set of personal computer (PC)-based part-task training software products shall be updated, along with materials to support the training of piloting and navigation teams.  The contractor shall provide qualified personnel to upgrade and integrate the individual part-task training software training products for the SubSkillsNet to form a multi-use team trainer. 

The following list contains the specialized skills required to develop and maintain SubSkillsNet, Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT), and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

•	Sufficient knowledge of and experience with the NMEA 0183 interface to extend the SubSkillsNet/VMS real-time data communication.  Since NMEA 0183 is a serial protocol, this knowledge also extends to familiarity with virtual serial port software.
•	The capability to write software to read, process, and write Digital Nautical Chart data (DNC) and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).
•	Knowledge of and experience with SQL, XML, HTML and PSP sufficient to create dynamic databases, generate documentation, and maintain a website.
•	Extensive knowledge of and experience with TCP/IP programming, especially as it relates to interfacing to the Common Basic Operator Trainer (CBOT), the Sonar Basic Operator Trainer (SBOT), and the Naiad library high-level networking functions used throughout the SubSkillsNet product line.
•	Ability to implement DIS protocol data units (PDUs), standard and experimental, to create real-time visualizations of ocean surface, underwater, ships, navigation aids, and landmass.
•	Experience with hardware and software interfaces to servo-digital converters and custom USB boards.
•	Experience with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ IDE, InstallShield, Visual Source Safe, 3D Studio Max, DirectX9 (sound, interface, and 3D)
•	Familiarity and experience with creating surface ship, submarine, and aircraft spherical photographs.  This process requires professional photography skills using specialized equipment and subsequent digital editing and “stitching” of adjacent photographs to create each spherical node.  Also required is knowledge of maintaining and extending 3D rendering software that projects each resulting image file onto a flat display surface.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for: • United States On-Orbit Segment (USOS) Cargo and Experiment Delivery and Return – provide for the delivery, disposal, and/or return of USOS cargo or experiment items • Integration of US science payloads that require interface with the Russian Segment of the International Space Station (ISS) • Sustaining engineering and manufacture of the Space Shuttle Program (SSP)/ISS docking mechanisms • Supporting updates to the joint ISS Inventory Management System software and operations • Additional hardware and services to support ISS integration and operations including:  additional Galley hot water dispenser for food preparation, Orlan telemetry matching units, trade studies, delivery of configuration management data, etc. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Public Corporation Energia (RSC Energia), subject to Department of State approval. • The Cargo and Experiment delivery, disposal, and/or return will be performed using a Russian Soyuz or Progress vehicle.  Besides the Space Shuttle, the Soyuz and Progress are the only vehicles currently compatible with and able to dock to the ISS vehicle.  It is anticipated that the ISS Program will need additional capability beyond that of the Space Shuttle. • RSC Energia is the sole integrator of the systems and operations of the Russian Segment and, as such, is uniquely qualified to provide the analyses and physical integration required for US science payloads to safely and effectively operate in the Russian Segment.  As the entity responsible for overall integration and sustaining engineering of the Russian Segment, RSC Energia is the sole provider capable of ensuring that US science payloads interfacing with the Russian Segment are fully compatible and in compliance with all existing Russian standards for that segment. • The SSP/ISS docking mechanisms were designed and manufactured by RSC Energia and provide for robustness and commonality with other ISS docking ports.  As such, specialists at RSC Energia are uniquely qualified to sustain and manufacture the mechanism. • The inventory management and hardware and services will provide commonality with existing on-orbit functions, which will allow for minimization of spares and crew training and continued safe ISS operations.  In addition, RSC Energia was the original designer and current owner of the data that will be used to perform the services. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Mesh adaptation software that may be coupled with two NASA unstructured Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes, FUN3D and USM3D.   Mesh adaptation will enhance the accuracy of CFD solutions in a number of critical areas of interest to NASA, in particular to the prediction of aerodynamic loads on the ARES vehicle (Crew Launch Vehicle) under evaluation by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate.   The software should be able to read the solution files for both FUN3D and USM3D. Then, adapt the grid, interpolate the solution based on user defined parameters and provide solution files that are compatible with both USM3D and FUN3D format. Because of the large problem sizes being run for ARES, the adaptation must be done able to be performed on multiple processors; single-processor adaptation will place an unacceptable bottleneck in the solution process. While USM3D and FUN3D both use tetrahedral elements, FUN3D can also use hexahedral and prismatic elements, so the mesh adaptation software must also be able to handle these element types. In addition, the file formats used by USM3D and FUN3D differ and must be accommodated by the mesh adaptation software.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the services from. Combustion Research And Flow Technology (Craft Tech), who is the only known responsible source. The CRAFT Tech CRISP code  is currently compatible with USM3D, and can be modified to provide compatibility with FUN3D;  the CRISP software performs dynamic load balancing in addition to parallel adaptation,  resulting in more efficient use of available computational resources; and offers a choice of feature-based or error-based adaptation.  The sole source authority for this item is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 20, 2006.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for the following items: Item 1:  110 Kip Load Frame Materials Testing System and accessories:  The final end use and purpose of this system is to duplicate the current capabilities of the Thermal Structures Lab (TSL) for the Structural Mechanics and Concepts Branch (SMCB).  The TSL is undergoing a move as part of a lab consolidation effort, and during this time projects, such as the CEV project, will require the use of the 110 Kip Materials Testing System.  Having a duplicate materials testing system ensures that projects can still be performed during the down time associated with moving the current 110 Kip Materials Testing System and ensures faithful replication of tests.  A new test system, identical in manufacture and compatible with existing test hardware will ensure timely relocation to meet program milestones. Items 2 and 3:	Hydraulic pump and hydraulic power unit used to provide hydraulic power to several test stands in the Materials Research Laboratory.  The requested pump and hydraulic power unit will replace two (2) forty-year old pump systems that are experiencing recurring mechanical and electrical problems and have become a liability in terms of maintenance cost and reliability. The pump unit must remain on-line for extended periods in order to provide power to test stands that are operating in support of Return to Flight, Aeronautics, and Exploration programs. These programs involve test profiles that require uninterrupted and reliable power as provided by the pump unit. The tests are critical and the test results are deliverables on schedule-driven task assignments.  The requested system must interact with the existing government owned MTS hydraulic test systems.   The minimum technical specifications for the 110 Kip Load Frame Materials Testing System and accessories, hydraulic pump and power unit are provided in an attachment to this synopsis. Item 4: four each MTS Model 493.25 Universal Conditioners. These conditioners are needed to upgrade the capability of existing government owned MTS FlexTest Controllers.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from MTS Systems Corporation, who is the only known responsible source.  The proposed items must be compatible with existing government owned test fixtures and MTS Systems Corporation manufactured 458 electronic controllers and hydraulic power supply units.  The proposed materials testing system will serve to duplicate the current capabilities of the Thermal Structures Lab.  Since only MTS Systems Corporation has access to its proprietary engineering drawings, electronic interface communication protocol, and design details, MTS is considered to be the only qualified source in this acquisition.  The authority for this action is the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), and 10 USC 2304(c)(1).   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 20, 2006.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The following is an announcement for a Pre-Solicitation Conference, which will be held for the NCCT TOXCAST PROGRAM procurement entitled "ToxCast Prioritization of Environmentally Relevant Chemicals: (P#2) Bioactivity Profiling of the ToxCast Compound Library."  This procurement is the EPA's second attempt at soliciting proposals for the work described in the performance work statement. The previous Request for Proposal (RFP) # PR-HQ-06-14708 was entitled "ToxCast Prioritization of Environmentally Relevant Chemicals: (P#2) Gene Family Panel Screening of the ToxCast Compound Library." That RFP was canceled by the EPA on August 31st. Based on the results of the first solicitation, the Agency has revised several aspects of the procurement and will re-solicit the work under the RFP # PR-HQ-06-15840. The Pre-Solicitation Conference will be held on September 27, 2006 at 12:30 PM (ET) at U.S. EPA, Office of Research and Development (ORD) Conference Room (4th Floor Lobby, Room #s ORMA Conf. Rm. 1 & 2), Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C., 20004.  Information on the conference is available on EPA?s web page at: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0615840/index.htm. The EPA encourages all interested parties and potential offerors to attend the conference.  Draft documents, including the performance work statement, the contract line items, the solicitation/contract specialized clauses and the solicitation evaluation criteria, have been made available on the web page. The EPA anticipates that the procurement will be procured using FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIVE PROCEDURES.   THE APPLICABLE NAICS CODE IS 541710.  Please e-mail the Contracting Officer at "nanartowicz.john@epa.gov" by September 25th to express your interest in attending the conference and to comment on any of the draft documents. BACKGROUND: The Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development established the National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) in 2005 to research the utility of computational chemistry, high-throughput screening (HTS) and various toxicogenomic technologies for Agency use in chemical prioritization, quantitative risk assessment and biological modeling. As part of this, the NCCT is developing computational tools for interpreting data from these technologies to classify chemicals, predict toxicity, and prioritize limited testing resources towards chemicals and endpoints that present the greatest risk to human health and the environment. Thus a chemical prioritization research program, entitled ToxCast, is being initiated with the purpose of developing the ability to predict, or forecast toxicity. The proof-of-concept phase of ToxCast will focus upon chemicals with a rich toxicological database (e.g., registered pesticide actives), in order to provide an interpretive context.  Following this proof-of-concept, the ToxCast program will move on to other environmental chemicals domains relevant to EPA. The ToxCast program will evaluate chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains: physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities based on existing structure-activity models, biochemical properties based on HTS assays, cell based phenotypic assays, and genomic and metabolomic analyses of cells. SCOPE: Much of the data in these various domains will be generated through a series of seven (7) integrated Performance Work Statements (PWS).  The contracts that may be awarded from this re-solicitation effort will be an essential component of the ToxCast program over the next five years, providing data populating the various domains that can be interpretively linked to known or predicted toxicological properties of environmental chemicals.

<SUBJECT>A--Request for Information modeling and simulation support and analyses for Unmanned Aircraft Systems to operate in the National Airspace
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-09-08-2006
<RESPDATE>100906
<ARCHDATE>10092006
<CONTACT>james boys, (937) 255-3062
<DESC>Request for Information For Modeling and simulation support and analyses for Unmanned Aircraft Systems  to operate in the National Airspace 1.  The Air Force must operate Unmanned Air Vehicles throughout the  National Air Space (NAS) in a manner similar to manned aircraft by filing  a flight plan and operating normally in the NAS.  Currently, the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) only allows unmanned aircraft to operate  within the NAS by segregating manned and unmanned aircraft, using  Certificates of Authorization (COAs) or Temporary Flight Restrictions  (TFRs).  The NAS is managed by the FAA, through a series of flight rules  and an active air traffic control system (ATC), with the objective of  keeping operating aircraft from colliding with one another to the maximum  extent possible.  Since no solution can be all-encompassing, there will  always be situations where the rules and ATC processes fail.  Therefore,  the FAA also requires manned aircraft operators to maintain vigilance to  “see and avoid” (SAA) other aircraft when operating in the NAS.  This SAA  requirement is, in essence, an additional layer of safety added to the  primary means of maintaining aircraft separation.  Since unmanned aircraft  do not have a pilot on-board the aircraft, they cannot literally comply  with the “see and avoid” requirement.  Thus, the removal of the pilot is  viewed as a reduction in aviation safety.  In order to operate Unmanned  Aircraft Systems (UAS) normally in the NAS, a means to restore it to an  equivalent level of safety (ELOS) to that of a similar class of manned  aircraft is required.  The FAA has stated that any approach taken “do no  harm” to the existing routine and safety of the current NAS.  That is, no  extraordinary or revolutionary changes in the way the current NAS is  operating would be acceptable.  Minor evolutionary changes would be  considered point by point, as required. 2.  Safety of operations is the primary concern when remotely or  autonomously operated aircraft are allowed to mix with conventionally  controlled flights in the NAS.  There is currently no experience base on  UASs that the FAA can use to issue rules and guidance.  Given that there  are currently no performance standards for SAA systems and no approval  criteria for autonomous collision avoidance systems, it is unclear how to  proceed in giving unmanned systems an "equivalent level of safety" to  manned aircraft.  The Air Force therefore intends to derive initial  capability requirements for SAA system performance (sensor performance,  communications performance, and control) through modeling, simulation, and  analysis of representative UASs. 3.  The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to solicit  information regarding the development and simulation of an environment  that would permit modeling the “knowns” (generic aircraft including  communications, command and control performance for each class, flight  rules, ATC rules, etc.) and providing “parameter space” for the unknowns.  The goal of this modeling effort is the establishment of a performance  specification investigative tool to permit the iterative optimization of  an SAA system that enables safe UAS operations in the NAS under a given  set of operating constraints. 4.  Respondents should limit their responses to the above request to 10  pages, double spaced, single sided paper.  White Papers are due 9 OCT 2006  and should be submitted directly to the technical point of contact Maj  Luke Cropsey, 303d AESG/XR (937-255-9969), Bldg 557, Rm 213, 2640 Loop  Road West, Wright-Patterson AFB OH  45433. Contractual point of contact is  Mr. James Boys, 303d AESG/PK , (937-255-3062). This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201 (e)  to obtain information about pricing, delivery, and other market  information or capabilities for planning purposes.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State Office of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Sole Source Award to Colt Defense LLC Hartford, CT for the acquisition of three-hundred (300) M4A1's and three-thousand (3000) magazines included.  Colt Manufacturing is the only legitimate source of the M4A1 Carbine as they are the exclusive owner of the M4A1 Carbine technical data package, which includes ownership of the design, patent and trademark rights.  This requirement is needed to replace current unserviceable M4A1's in the field, and for issuance to new agents already trained on the weapons in the field.  The M4A1 is the system that DS agents have been trained to use and the economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons to issue to various missions overseas.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1).  FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and other supplies or services will satisfy the agency?s requirements.  This is for informational purposes only.

SubSkillsNet is a family of part-task trainers under development at NAVAIR Orlando TSD that focus on tactics, navigation and piloting, collision avoidance, classification of sonar contact information and contact target motion analysis (TMA).  Each trainer is designed to run individually as a single task trainer or networked with other SubSkillsNet trainers to provide a low-cost team training capability. There are currently over two-dozen unique applications that have been delivered to the fleet. 
    	
The SubSkillsNet product line has been ongoing since 1997.  During this timeframe, it has been receiving periodic updates to incorporate improved and new capabilities. NAVAIR Orlando TSD has identified an ongoing requirement for the continued development of new and related products. These products fall into the SubSkillsNet family including the Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT) and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

A set of personal computer (PC)-based part-task training software products shall be updated, along with materials to support the training of piloting and navigation teams.  The contractor shall provide qualified personnel to upgrade and integrate the individual part-task training software training products for the SubSkillsNet to form a multi-use team trainer. 

The following list contains the specialized skills required to develop and maintain SubSkillsNet, Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT), and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

Sufficient knowledge of and experience with the NMEA 0183 interface to extend the SubSkillsNet/VMS real-time data communication.  Since NMEA 0183 is a serial protocol, this knowledge also extends to familiarity with virtual serial port software.
The capability to write software to read, process, and write Digital Nautical Chart data (DNC) and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).
Knowledge of and experience with SQL, XML, HTML and PSP sufficient to create dynamic databases, generate documentation, and maintain a website.
Extensive knowledge of and experience with TCP/IP programming, especially as it relates to interfacing to the Common Basic Operator Trainer (CBOT), the Sonar Basic Operator Trainer (SBOT), and the Naiad library high-level networking functions used throughout the SubSkillsNet product line.
Ability to implement DIS protocol data units (PDUs), standard and experimental, to create real-time visualizations of ocean surface, underwater, ships, navigation aids, and landmass.
Experience with hardware and software interfaces to servo-digital converters and custom USB boards.
Experience with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ IDE, InstallShield, Visual Source Safe, 3D Studio Max, DirectX9 (sound, interface, and 3D)
Familiarity and experience with creating surface ship, submarine, and aircraft spherical photographs.  This process requires professional photography skills using specialized equipment anequipment and subsequent digital editing and “stitching” of adjacent photographs to create each spherical node.  Also required is knowledge of maintaining and extending 3D rendering software that projects each resulting image file onto a flat display surface.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau Budget Division has a requirement for expert services for system administration and support that will meet the needs of the Bureau Budget Division.  The Census BUREAU Budget system is the Consolidated Budget Reporting Application (COBRA).  COBRA is the system of record for project listings and project funding amounts. Preliminary personnel resource information feeds to COBRA from the Commerce Business System (CBS).  Users update personnel resource and enter funding information to transaction screens.  Funding information then feeds into CBS. COBRA allow users to create and route for approval Project Descriptions (PD), Position Listings (PL), Operating Plans (OP), and Budget Planning Documents (BPD) in support of budget formulation and budget execution activities.  Budgets are linked at a project and participating organization level to Census Bureau Strategic Goals and Performance Targets. COBRA was constructed from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and open source components. HYPERION PLANNING with the Essbase database, using Microsoft (MS) SQL Server 2000 database for metadata management, provides the core transactional and reporting functionality.  The HYPERION components include (1) HYPERION Application Link 7.1, (2) HYPERION Planning 3.5, (3) Hyperion Reports 7.0, (4) Hyperion Essbase 7.1, and (5 Hyperion Essbase Deployment Services (EDS) 7.1.  The system is web-based with system components using .NET 2003 web services and Java Server Pages (JSP) on Apache Tomcat, IIS, and Web Logic.  System components, including customizations, are coded in C# and Java.  Job streams are controlled using Vignette Business Systems.  Configuration management is done in Visual Source Safe 6.0.The purpose of this requirement is to provide operational and systems support services to the Budget Division for COBRA.   Incremental addition of new functionality will be done as needed to accommodate user needs.  The objectives of this requirement are to: Provide effective COBRA system reliability and performance for up to 250 geographically separated users?, Provide effective coordination with IT support staff in maintaining Budget COBRA servers, and Provide effective coordination with Hyperion in the maintenance and troubleshooting of the Hyperion components of COBRA.  The expected outcome is that COBRA will function without significant interruption of services and that user needs for budget formulation and budget execution activities will be facilitated.  The contractor shall provide four (4) specific tasks: TASK 1. ON-GOING SYSTEM MAINTENACE, TASK 2. PLAN, MANAGE, AND IMPLEMENT SOFTWARE UPGRADES, TASK 3. ASSIST FUNCTIONAL STAFF, AND TASK 4 PLAN, MANAGE, AND IMPLEMENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ENHANCEMENT. It is the Government's intention to solicit and negotiate a competitive procurement under the authority of 41 U.S. 253(6)(1) and FAR 6.1.  The intended contract will have a period of performance of one year and will include four one-year option periods. The proposed type of contract is a Time and Material Contract.  Please submit an original and two (2)copies of the technical and cost proposals to the U.S. Census Bureau primary point of contact, Ms. Agnes Williams, by the close of business, 3:30 P.M.

<RESPDATE>092606
<ARCHDATE>11252006
<CONTACT>Sandra Connors, 309-782-6506
<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Research is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing 20mm PGU-30A/B Cartridges, and perform various 20mm Linking efforts. The Government Technical Data Package (TDP) contains the performance spe cification and top-level drawings. The main components include Brass Cartridge Case, Propellant, Projectile, and Primer. The performance requirements include Function and Casualty, Muzzle Velocity, Chamber Pressure, Action Time, Accuracy, Environmental Con ditions, and Waterproofness. The TDP is classified as 'Distribution X'; distribution is authorized to US Government Agencies and private individuals or enterprises eligible to obtain export controlled technical data. The Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S .C., Sec 2751, et.seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401 et.seq., restrict distribution of the TDP. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate IAW provisions of  DOD Directive 523 0.25. Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of the top two drawings (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp for instructions and information). A respondent to this market survey must have availabl e the facilities and skills required to manufacture and demonstrate via test that these cartridges meet all government specification requirements. Specific production capabilities and skills required to manufacture the 20mm PGU-30A/B include: ballistics ex pertise, chemical expertise in the formulation and production of propellant, production line set-up mechanics, and process and design engineering knowledge related to the load, assembly, and pack-out (LAP) for 20mm cartridges. Key industrial capabilities/e quipment include (1) automated LAP line (which includes projectile trace for the PGU-30A/B, primer insertion, loading of propellant into cartridge cases, and sealing and crimping of the projectile to the case), (2) ballistic test lab equipment, (3) 20mm LW  Mann barrels, (4) indoor and outdoor test ranges which permit the safe, instrumented, firing of this cartridge, and (5) machining of the projectile body and nose, drawing and machining the cartridge case, and forming the link. Linking operation for the PG U-28 A/B SAPHEI and PGU-30A/B TP-T requires a facility that meets all safety and distant requirements for such explosive material. The equipment must be able to handle the mixing ratio for the configuration of rounds and place rounds at proper depth to the  link , and have the appropriate inspection systems in place. Skills required to produce these cartridges include: ammunition process/design engineers; set-up mechanics and operators familiar with the programming and operation of ammunition component sub-a ssembly production equipment and LAP production equipment identified above; toolmakers and machinists to support all production facilities/equipment; certified inspectors, quality control engineers, ultrasonic technicians, metallurgists; ballistics test pe rsonnel to perform in-process ballistic testing and final inspection, pack-out, First Article Test (FAT) and Lot Acceptance Test (LAT); ballistics testing, and shipment of ammunition products. These critical skills require an extended period of time to acq uire the job knowledge needed to manufacture and provide high quality ammunition in a timely manner. Due to the customers demand for timely deliveries, the producers must be able to successfully conduct and complete a FAT within 150 days after award and fi rst production within 180 days after award. Government furnished material will be the PGU-28A/B, MK3 pallets, and M548 cans. Interested U.S./Canadian firms who feel they are capable of manufacturing 20mm PGU-30A/B and various linking efforts are invited to  indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief description or summary of their company's capabilities, including a brief description of facilities , personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria. Information must be submitted to: HQ, ASC, ATTN: AMSAS-ACA-F/Sandy Connors, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 61299-6000. Please respond NO LATER THAN 26 September 200 6 and identify 'CTG 20MM PGU-30A/B Medium Caliber Sources Sought/Market Research' as the subject of your response. This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as on obligation on the part of th e Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

If a large business is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirements for a subcontracting plan f or that part of the work it intends to subcontract.

<ARCHDATE>11282006
<CONTACT>James E. Fletcher, 256-876-9467
<DESC>The United States (US) Army Program Executive Officer for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Targets Management Office (TMO) is seeking sources for an unmanned helicopter target system used in live fire tracking and engagement testin g by air defense missile systems to be conducted on Department of Defense test and training ranges. The TMO is interested in adding a low cost target helicopter that: can perform tracking and live fire missions; meet the flight performance setout below; is completely independent of any external power requirements; is capable of operating in harsh range c onditions; is fully transportable by road, rail, air, and sea; is capable of multiple target missions once set up at a range site; is capable of being maintained and repaired under field conditions by trained personnel with minimal use of special tools and  test equipment; and is very inexpensive to operate.   The target system will be operated on Department of Defense and Allied Nation test and training ranges within the United States and overseas.  The target system will be required to operate during periods of daylight and darkness and under Basic, Hot-Dry, a nd limited Cold-Wet climatic conditions and launch and recover in winds of 10 knots gusting to 15 knots.   The target should replicate generic threat helicopters as closely as is technically and economically feasible. However, there are a number of system performance characteristics which are considered essential to adequately test US antiaircraft weapon system s.  These are: Maximum Speed  greater than or equal to110 knots true air speed; Minimum Speed - Hover (Rearward flight is not required.); Hover Altitude - Hover in ground effect (HIGE) at less than 25 feet above ground level (AGL) at 6400 feet density alt itude.  Hover out of ground effect at 200 feet AGL at 5100 feet density altitude; Precision Hover within 20 feet of a point while operating at less than 25 feet AGL at 6500 feet density altitude in wind less than 10 knots;  Pop up maneuver - Perform vertic al climb from 20 feet to 45 feet in less than 3 seconds at 6500 feet density altitude;  Flight Altitude - 30 ft AGL in forward flight plus or equal to10 ft;  Operational Ceiling - greater than or equal to 10,000 ft Density Altitude;  Acceleration -  greate r than or equal to plus 2g vertical;  Endurance -  greater than or equal to 60 minutes without refueling;  Logistics and Readiness - The time for preflight checkout of drone and emulation systems aboard the aircraft must be no more than 90 minutes;  Payloa ds - The target must be capable of carrying, and supplying electrical power for, countermeasure and/or signature augmentation subsystems, such as flares with their associated equipment IR/RF jammers and/or augmenters.  Countermeasures should be mounted and  dispensed from the same general locations and exhibit the same dispersal patterns as typical threat helicopters. Mission Scenarios - Scenarios for use of the helicopter which support the engagement by US and allied nation systems will include hover, attack, and ambush.  These may be at high or low altitudes.  The hover and attack may be masked or unmasked.  These sce narios must be either executed directly or may be simulated by maneuvers such as a racetrack pattern that give the US system repeated presentations of the target under nearly identical conditions.  Targets must be flown in a safe/controlled manner.  Target s may be controlled by the Target Tracking and Control System  UHF (TTCS-U) and the airborne control/autopilot supplied with the helicopter.  Employment tactics will include:  Racetrack orbits at medium and low altitudes, Shallow diving attacks at a simul ated ground target, Maneuver from concealed hover to attack in pop up missile launch and guidance, and Night time test operations.  The primary location for target use is the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  Secondary use at other locations will be neces sary.  Likely secondary lo cations include Yuma Proving Ground and sea level ranges such as Eglin AFB and Point Mugu.   Government Furnished Equipment- The Government is contemplating provision of existing ground control stations (Target Tracking and Control System  UHF) for this target system that could significantly reduce the cost of procurement and operation. Sources are sought which have existing mature hardware (either COTS or as a result of R&D) as well as sources with experience in similar/compatible systems who may be interested in providing helicopter targets to the government.  Any company with the exper tise to provide the required target system is invited to submit a statement of interest by 29 SEP 06 along with data to substantiate its qualifications. Data provided to substantiate qualifications should include information on current products meeting the  general characteristics stated in this announcement and the reason(s) why a suggested product could be expected to achieve the capabilities requested.  Sources with similar/compatible experience should provide the contract number of any current or previou s government contract(s) for similar products.  Interest in providing operational presentations for these should be included.  It is highly desirable that data submitted be provided with unlimited rights.  However, responses to this sources sought synopsis  that indicate data/information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for US Government Use Only.  All proprietary/restricted data/information submitted must be clearly marked as an a ddendum to non-restricted, non-proprietary data/information.   The purpose of this synopsis is to identify potential sources only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Full and open competition is contemplated for any solicitation to meet the aeria l target system requirement.  The submission of a statement of interest does not constitute participation in any future request for proposal.   All information should be submitted to the Targets Management Office, ATTN:  SFAE-STRI-PMITTS-QE/Tony Giannoni, Bldg. 3211, Hercules Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898-7458, no later than 29 September 2006.

The Leica Vector IV is the only laser range finder has been evaluated and approved for use by the Air Force Laser System Safety Board for use by tactical combat weather teams in operational environments in accordance with the Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standard (AFOSHSTD) 48-139, Laser Radiation Protection Program, Chapter 5.  The requested Leica Vector IV is a USAF-approved eye-safe laser range finder system.  The Leica measures distance, azimuth, and elevation to targets up to 4000 meters.  The system can also display horizontal distance, height difference, and azimuth between two remote objects.  The Leica Vector is utilized by SOCCENT weather forces to accurately observe/measure cloud heights and to determine visibility marker distances.  The binoculars may be used at fixed airfield locations but the primary use is in field-type conditions.  The laser is a designated Class 1 laser.  It is non-hazardous and does not require the use of laser safety eyewear (has built-in ocular laser radiation protection), therefore the military-only Leica Vector IV is required.

SOCCENT weather forces will utilize the Leica Vector IV to train Special Operations Weather Teams to take surface weather observations in deployed and fixed locations.  The training must use the same equipment as currently used by gaining AFSOC weather units.  In the field observations will be used for mission planning, execution, and post mission operations.  The Leica Vector IV is currently being used by all SOCCENT weather forces.  Continued use of this model will preclude costly and time consuming training lesson plan and unit equipment operating procedure rewrites.  

Market research was conducted and comparable products were either not approved through policy outlined in  AFOSHSTD 48-139 or not compatible with current training provided to deployed individuals.  This signifies the only notice for resulting award which will be made upon closing pending any responses received.

<SUBJECT>D -- Integrated Customer Response Facility
<DESC>1	Purpose of RFI
The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on behalf of the Social Security Administration (SSA) about a strategy to leverage existing, emerging, and converging customer service delivery channels. 

SSA is seeking information on what Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products and/or services are available to support customer service convergence and how to evolve or replace current customer service delivery with a more integrated customer service environment.

RFI Respondents are asked to provide input that reflects a customer support system that is robust enough to support agents located in thousands of geographically diverse locations, will increase agent productivity, reduce cost, provide secure communications channels, and enhance or replace current systems.

Using information gathered from responses to this RFI, the Government may issue a solicitation to vendors interested in becoming an ICRF provider. ALL STAKEHOLDERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT RESPONSES TO ALL OR PARTS OF THE RFI EVEN IF THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY INTENTION OF RESPONDING TO A FUTURE SOLICITATION.

Nothing in this document shall be construed as obligating the Government to issue a Solicitation.
2	Background

SSA currently operates an in-house developed Internet Email Customer Response System (ICRS) software solution for responding to e:mail inquiries in a few SSA locations. 
3	Basic Functionality

As a first step, SSA is interested in replacing the home-grown ICRS and providing enhanced functionality, such as auto-response functionality. The current ICRS is a service delivery channel which has room for additional automation.

SSA would like to know what products and/or services are available to replace or enhance this stand-alone centralized e:mail solution. Instead of using a small group of agents to handle e:mail inquiries, SSA would like to leverage the expertise of employees located around the country. This enterprise-wide e:mail solution would allow for the distribution of work to multiple components across the agency so that the available customer service capacity and expertise could be used to the greatest advantage.
4	Integration
In addition to determining which COTS products and/or services are available for replacing or enhancing the current e:mail answering solution, SSA is seeking information on how a replacement system could be integrated with other customer support channels, such as Internet, chat and click, and call functionality. 
5	Long Term Vision
Ultimately, SSA is looking to fully integrate all service delivery channels including e:mail, phone, and chat. With that goal in mind, the agency is seeking information to help plan for transitioning to this new integrated service delivery environment.
6	Contents of the Response
Respondents should address the following desired features and are invited to recommend additional desired features. It is not necessary to respond to each item. It is recognized that respondents may have different areas of expertise and interest. Please identify by Heading / Number each outcome / question you are addressing.

Security
1		Ability to perform secure web-based communications (e.g. email and chat) so that sensitive information (like SSN, name, date of birth, medical information, etc) can be exchanged between customers and SSA agents.
Scalability
2		Ability to scale up to a large number of SSA employees involved in direct contact with the public(e.g. up to about 20-25,000 employees) as possible customer service agents.
3	 	Ability to route or distribute to the most appropriate individual or group of individuals to respond to each inquiry.
Automation
4		Ability to interface with legacy systems and provide a feature that routes all channels of inquiries and allows the next agent, based on availability or skill set, the ability to receive an incoming email, phone call, or chat, from one queue.
5		Ability to automatically propose responses to inquiries when agents are preparing responses.
6		Ability to keep a centralized record of the history of each inquiry, so that if a customer attempts to obtain a self-service answer (by Internet, online FAQ, or telephone) but can???t, the agent will be aware of the customer???s attempt and will find another solution to the inquiry. Consider legacy call center telephone hardware and software.
7		Ability to perform spelling and grammar checks on e-mails and / or chats before they are sent.
8		Ability to automatically populate selected articles and pre-written responses to e-mail / chat messages.
9		Ability to automatically suppress duplicate messages.
10		Ability to include working hyperlinks in article text.
11		Ability to support quick turn around times when providing responses for all delivery channels.
Maintainability
12		Ability to add, update, archive, and approve response articles as they are developed and retired.
13		Ability to import existing knowledge base content, currently stored in MS Word files and an SQL database.
14		Ability to easily access archived records.
Flexibility
15		Ability to allow customers to reach out to SSA via one channel but be seamlessly switched to another channel at the customer???s or SSA agent???s discretion.
16		Explain the advantages / disadvantages of hosting the solution at SSA???s site or at the vendor???s site. 
17		Allow special characters in the subject line of an e-mail.
18		Ability to validate e-mail addresses upon receipt.
19		Enhanced artificial intelligence to parse messages based on language. Ability to discern when a foreign language word is used as a literal (as in, part of a street address) when the rest of the message is in English, and conversely, the ability to discern that an English language word is contained within in a foreign language word (as in ???pregunta???, the Spanish word for question contains the English word ???gun,??? but should still be parsed as a Spanish language inquiry).
20		Enhanced artificial intelligence to parse messages based on keywords.
21		Ability to allow co-browsing so that agents and customers can see the same screens.
Tracking / Reassignment
22		Unlimited ability to reassign inquiries.
23		Ability to track response times, reassign inquiries as needed, and escalate inquiries to supervisors when customer service goals are not met.
24		Ability to refer inquiries to other agents when they are inappropriately assigned.

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Dell Latitude D820 Laptop.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.As part of the “NIV on a laptop” initiative, CA/CST has identified the Dell Latitude D820 laptop as the laptop that meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested laptop options. The Dell Latitude D820 laptop was selected for the following reasons: •	Ability to be configured as a training server, loaded with an Oracle database, and with all CA overseas applications. •	Ability to run WinMagic SecureDoc software. •	Exceeds the Consular Affairs minimum hardware requirements for laptop workstations. Because CA will be running both the NIV software and the Oracle database on the same computer, processor speed and storage capacity are ciritical factors in the performance of the system.  Dual-core processors allow the Latitude D820 laptop workstation to split tasks between two separate processor cores, splitting the load and get more done in less time. The processors do more work each second, allowing the user to run multiple applications with noticeably quicker results.  The NIV technical team has conducted test with the Dell Latitude D820 and has demonstrated that the NIV system will run successfully.     An added feature is a wide variety of available security software solutions and uses a tri-factor authentication process. The Smart Card reader requires both a card and a password for the operating system to start up, and the user can add the optional fingerprint reader for the third level of user security. With the additional security of a standard slot for locks, optional notebook tracking software, and compatibility with leading security software, the Latitude D820 laptop workstation is safe from hackers, thieves, and malicious viruses and worms. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the Dell Latitude D820 laptop because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Dell Latitude D820 laptop has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The workstation has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation services prepared in accordance with the format in  FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation 701816Q053 is issued as a Request For Quotes (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisitions Circular #2001-25b. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 (Alaska) is requesting quotes to provide QuickBird Satellite Imagery as stated below: STATEMENT OF WORK  TITLE: Contract for satellite imagery to be used in a study of Yukon River floodplain vegetation succession  BACKGROUND: The Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge field station would like to establish a contract to acquire QuickBird satellite imagery (archive and new imagery) for a section of the Yukon River riparian corridor. The refuge is interested in examining floodplain vegetation successional dynamics on the Yukon River and how they are influenced by abiotic (erosion/accretion) and biotic (moose) interactions. Moose are an important resource to Yukon Flats residents and we currently lack knowledge of their forage habitat quality and quantity along the Yukon. Acquiring current satellite imagery (along with fieldwork conducted by Refuge staff) will allow us to identify and describe the distribution, extent, and structure of major plant communities (at the early successional stage) of the Yukon River floodplain.  To better understand plant successional trajectories over time, we will use current satellite imagery with aerial photography from previous time periods (1950's and 1970/80's) to conduct change detection analyses of vegetation and river erosion/accretion events. With this information, we hope to improve our knowledge of plant successional dynamics on a major Alaska river and can test plant succession models developed for the much studied Tanana River floodplain system.  Additionally, we hope to better understand how these ecological drivers may be affected, although indirectly, by climate change.   WORK DESCRIPTION: See Below PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 1. Imagery Acquisition:   New Imagery      -Sept 20, 2006 to Sept 30, 2006 and/or     -June 10, 2007 to Sept 30, 2007 if atmospheric conditions not suitable in      Archive Imagery     -Already available in QuickBird Library (see technical detail for imagery scene i.d. numbers) 2. Imagery Delivery   New Imagery     -October (2006 and/or 2007) following imagery acquisition or earlier if available.

TPM can refuse any lot of seed based on inferior germination, inferior purity, unacceptable contamination, wrong species of seed, or other factors that would make the seed inferior or introduce unacceptable weeds to the site.  
?	Contractor will purchase seed in Pure Live Seed Pounds (PLS lbs). For example, if 100 PLS lbs of sagebrush seed is needed, and the germination rate of the seed is 85%, the total weight of seed needed to provide 100 PLS lbs would be 117.85 lbs. The formula is:   # of PLS lbs desired divided by the germination rate of the seed equals the PLS lbs.  100  ?  0.85 = 117.85
?	  Most seed companies provide pricing for PLS lbs.

2.  Contractor will ensure that qualified operators operate all equipment.

3.  Aerially seeding on JBR will be done around the existing flying schedule.  Range operations will not shut down for activities listed in the Tasks.  Range times will be made available to the Contractor no earlier than two weeks in advance of the open range time.  There is no explicit promise made herein for Contractor access on consecutive days, weekdays, or full 8-hour days on JBR or in the Mountain Home AFB Military Operating Areas (MOAs).  Contractor shall be required to perform seeding on weekends to take advantage of possible open range times.

4.  All equipment used on JBR must be thoroughly cleaned prior to aerially seeding.  Seeding equipment will be cleaned prior to use in the MHAFB MOAs to remove all mud, debris, and seeds.

5.  Contractor shall be responsible for accepting delivery of seed, storing seed in a climatically controlled environment that will maintain seed viability, and transporting seed to location where seeding will take place.

      WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

 be:

* an existing published wage determination
* a survey underlying a wage determination
* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a
  position on a wage determination matter
* a conformance (additional classification and rate)
  ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program.  If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the Branch
of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

     Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
     Wage and Hour Division
     U. S. Department of Labor
     200 Constitution Avenue, N. W.
     Washington, D. C.  20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:


          Wage and Hour Administrator
          U.S. Department of Labor

          200 Constitution Avenue, N. W.
          Washington, D. C.  20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage payment
data, project description, area practice material, etc.) that the
requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative Review
Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:

          Administrative Review Board
          U. S. Department of Labor
          200 Constitution Avenue, N. W.
          Washington, D. C.  20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

II.	Description of action:  This is a follow-on contract; firm-fixed price; commercial purchase order for one year to acquire Air Force Materiel Command-wide and Space Materiel Command licenses for SEER parametric cost estimating model software.


III.	Description of Supplies/Services:  

The proposed action is to acquire an Air Force Materiel Command-Wide and Space Materiel Command site license renewal for the Galorath Incorporated?s 1) SEER-SEM and 2) SEER-H.   These programs are parametric cost estimating models capable of estimating software acquisition and operating and support (O&S) costs.  The models are applicable to a wide range of systems acquired by the United States Government (such as aircraft, engines, armament, avionics, radar, software, simulators, support equipment, etc.)  The models perform cost calculations and have the ability to be adjusted to specific organizations and technologies.


One Year Total: 28 Sep 06 - 27 Sep 07
	a. AFMC- Estimating Suite				
	b. SMC-Estimating Suite				      
				


Acquisition History:  

For the past 20 years Galorath Incorporated has provided the industry?s most comprehensive set of decision-support and production optimization tools. Galorath Incorporated cost models have been successfully utilized for years across the Department of Defense.  Over 230 cost estimators AFMC wide utilize this cost model to do cost estimating across the command on programs totaling Billions of dollars.

A great need to develop more capable cost estimating tools was identified in 2000 and AFMC?s need for parametric modeling was a must.  The tool identified for parametric cost estimating was SEER and due to the dependency on this model and the concern of keeping the most recent version and technology up to date AFMC took action to consolidate.  Consolidation of the contract for AFMC enterprise-wide reduces cost and ensures that the Air Force is keeping up with technology.  It also allows AFMC cost estimators to move from one cost estimating job to another and still be familiar with the standard tool utilized in the cost estimator?s tool available to all AFMC assets command-wide.  With the consolidation of SEER cost estimating model AFMC wide, the MAJCOM saves the Air Force over $487k per year in funding and ensures cost capability is available to all AFMC assets.


IV.	Authority: 
10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b)(2)

V.	Applicability of Authority:

Galorath Incorporated SEER parametric cost estimating models are the cost estimating engine for the Acquisition portion of the Integrated Desktop Analysis and Planning System Concept Evaluation (ICE) tool.  (The ICE tool development was funded by the Air Force and developed by Frontier Technology and is widely used throughout AFMC.)  SEER parametric models were chosen as the Acquisition estimating engine for ICE due to their highly respected position within the DoD community and their extensive use by AFMC.  The SEER cost estimating models are highly respected in the cost estimating/analysis profession.  SEER estimates are accepted for the highest level DoD program milestone decisions.  The ICE tool can not function without the SEER parametric models. 

The methodology of the models must be capable of performing development, production, and O&S cost estimates, and be able to support cost sensitivity studies that incorporate peculiar development characteristics, varying degrees of complexity, time constraints, and inflation.  The O&S cost model must be able to produce model results/cost output in the standard Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Analysis Improvement Group CAIG approved cost element structure as found in the O&S Cost Estimating Guide, OSD CAIG.  The model must be able to estimate the impacts on cost of change in system specifications uniquely present in defense programs, quantities, schedules, and other supportability parameters.

The SEER-SEM and SEER-H are proprietary software products of Galorath Incorporated.  They have no resellers or distributors so the products are only available directly from Galorath Incorporated.

The SEER tool is the only software capable of fulfilling these requirements.   A sole source acquisition is justified because the SEER tool is proprietary software product of Galorath, Inc.  They have no resellers or distributors so the license renewals are only available directly from Galorath, Inc.

Without this sole-source acquisition, not having the ability to use this parametric cost estimating model would be excessively disruptive of many proposed, approved, and in-process acquisition programs.  Examples of programs include B2, JSF program office, F-15, F-16, 554th ELSG, and C-130; these are just a few programs currently utilizing this software on projects.  The long-term effects could be particularly severe.  Programs could enter the acquisition cycle with unrealistically small budgets due to flawed initial estimates created by lack of expertise with an alternate parametric model.


VI.	Efforts to Obtain Competition: 

A synopsis was conducted in 2000 and SEER Model was determined to be the only tool viable for the cost estimating task at hand.  Currently members of the AFMC cost estimating community stay abreast of technical developments in the parametric cost estimating environment by periodically attending professional activities at which various parametric model developers demonstrate their products.    At the current time, no other tools available are capable of providing the functionality as the SEER parametric cost estimating tool.  

This requirement including this J&A will be synopsized prior to award.  


VII.	Fair and Reasonable Costs:

Galorath Incorporated?s proposed price for the AFMC wide license is steeply discounted from the published price due to the consolidation of all AFMC licenses.  AFMC has been assured that they are getting the most favored customer discount.  SMC is being provided the published price for their license due to only having a license for one site and they are not provided a quantity discount.

AFMC purchases this software for more than 15 locations.  To procure one SEER-SEM Estimator Package license ($***** per year, per site) and one SEER-H Estimator Package ($***** per year, per site), would amount to $***** per year.  The discount provided to AFMC for bundling and purchasing for an entire command drastically decreases the cost to procure this software for the required cost personnel.

Given the above price evaluation and the Contracting Officer has determined the proposed price for the base and option year to be fair and reasonable.  

VIII.	Market Research:  
	      
The SEER cost estimating tool is proprietary data; therefore, the renewal license which includes support and updates is not available from other sources.  Full and Open Competition does not apply to this acquisition.  

IX.	Other Facts: 

SEER cost estimating model has become highly respected in the cost estimating/analysis profession.  SEER estimates are accepted for the highest level DoD program milestone decisions.  SEER cost model were chosen due to their highly respected position within the DoD community and their extensive use by AFMC.

The purpose of this contract is to keep the SEER cost estimating tool under one license for all AFMC units at a better price to the government and more widely available to command cost analysts.

Anticipated entry for Block C3 of the DD Form 350:  Not available for competition.

X.	Interested Sources:  

No other parties have expressed interest due to the fact that the Galorath Incorporated?s software has proprietary restrictions.

XI.	Steps to Foster Competition:  

Members of the AFMC cost estimating community will continue to stay abreast of technical developments in the cost estimating environment including activities such as periodically attending professional activities at which various parametric model developers demonstrate their products.  They will keep contact with other cost estimating organizations and review what tools and techniques are available and under developments.  These activities may permit AFMC to utilize other tools in the future which would be obtained competitively.

XII.	Contracting Officer?s Certification: 

The contracting officer?s signature on the J&A signature page evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).

XIII.	Technical/Requirements Personnel?s Certification: 

As evidenced by their signatures on the J&A signature page, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein which is their responsibility is both accurate and complete (FAR 6.303-2(b)).

Statement of Work:
A.  BACKGROUND
The Congressional Research Service (CRS), a service unit of the Library of Congress, works exclusively for the United States Congress, providing research, analysis, and information support to the members and committees of the House and Senate.  These services are provided by a highly educated staff of policy analysts, information specialists, and other professionals.

The mission of CRS is to provide to the Congress, throughout the legislative process, comprehensive and reliable legislative research, analysis and information services that are timely, non-partisan, and confidential, thereby contributing to an informed national legislature.  The vision of CRS is that the Congress turns to CRS first when it is in need of legislative, research analysis or information in addressing the issues of the Nation.  As an organization, CRS has adopted the values of client service, uncompromising integrity, total quality, mutual respect, and diversity.

As part of its ongoing efforts to ensure that CRS provides the highest possible quality of support to the Congress, CRS carries out a comprehensive training program to improve the knowledge base of CRS staff in a number of areas, including best practices in mentoring.

In 1999, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) Director established a Working Group to focus on mentoring activities that would further the Service’s goal to enhance diversity and to assist with succession planning.  This Working Group recommended the establishment of a formal CRS Mentor Program that would provide guidance to new employees by more experienced employees and facilitate support from management and staff to carry out that instruction.

As a result of their work, the Working Group recommended that the CRS Mentor Program develop a high quality, diverse workforce that values information exchange and encourages a creative and productive work environment.  The principle vehicle for this program commitment was that new employees would work closely with more experienced employees who would serve as role models to help new hires work effectively, make personal adjustments, and move forward in his/her careers.

B.  SCOPE OF WORK
To ensure that CRS staff have the training and tools they need to provide the highest quality analytical work for the Congress, CRS requires assistance in developing and delivering: (1)  on-site, customized Mentor/Mentee training as part of the implementation of the Mentor Program in CRS; (2) customized orientation to the CRS Mentor Program for the CRS Research Policy Council (RPC); and (3) a Mentor/Mentee Handbook based upon the customized mentor/mentee training program -- to be used as a training guide for new employees hired after the initial training program has been delivered.

C.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
The target audience for the Mentor/Mentee training will be the mentees –  newly hired CRS staff, including but not limited to analysts, attorneys, information specialists, and administrative personnel;  and mentors – experienced CRS employees.  The target audience for the customized orientation to the Mentor Program will be the Resource Policy Council (RPC) – senior level managers.
The learning objectives for the Mentor/Mentee training that must be met include, but are not limited to:
•Understanding the goals of the mentoring relationship in the context of CRS’s Mentor Program;
•Understanding mentoring, i.e., what it is and isn’t;
•Understanding the roles/responsibilities and expectations of mentors and mentees;
•Understanding the steps in establishing a meaningful mentoring relationship in initiating the mentoring process;
•Identifying a process for helping mentees solve problems; and
•Developing mentoring skills.
To provide the necessary assistance with this project, the contractor will: (1) meet with a representative group of CRS senior managers to assess CRS’s needs for course content, exercises, and case studies; (2) design a customized Mentor/Mentee training course; (3) design a customized orientation to the Mentor Program for CRS Resource Policy Council; (4) develop a customized Mentor/Mentee Handbook and course materials; (5)  present an orientation session for the RPC and  a pilot training course; 6) present up to three training courses that implement the final course design.
	
There will be approximately sixty (60) CRS staff members to be trained as part of the Mentor/Mentee training program.  This training may be in the format of either multiple half-day sessions or full day sessions, with up to fifteen (15) participants per course.  The contractor may propose the format.)

<SUBJECT>B -- Federal Lands Study

<CONTACT>Barry Socks, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-482-7209, Fax 202-501-2550, Email barry.socks@ncpc.gov - Barry Socks, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-482-7209, Fax 202-501-2550, Email barry.socks@ncpc.gov
<DESC>The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) provides overall planning guidance for federal land and buildings in the National Capital Region (NCR), which includes the District of Columbia; Prince George's and Montgomery Counties in Maryland; and Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William Counties in Virginia, including the cities and towns located within the geographic area bounded by these counties. NCPC is seeking a consultant or consultants to prepare an analysis of the projected federal need for land and building space in the District of Columbia.
NCPC is seeking a consultant to analyze the federal government's needs through 2017 to determine a reasonable and credible estimate of the need for facilities and land.  The goal is to determine the federal government's land, space, and facility requirements over the next ten years, looking specifically at demand by short- (approximately 2-year), mid- (approximately 5-year), and long-term (approximately 10-year) time frames.  The consultant should also consider the amount of land, if any, which is reasonable to meet unknown and/or future needs. 

A confluence of factors has the potential to shape the future availability of federal land and facilities in the District of Columbia.  Some of these factors include: the increasing need for secure federal facilities, legislation to transfer federal property to the District of Columbia, the Base Closure and Realignment actions, evolving workspace requirements resulting from more specialized staff functions and technological advances, and the ongoing federal workforce transformation.

This is a new research inquiry.  The consultants will need to use commercially available data, information that can be obtained through key federal stakeholder interviews, data bases that may be provided by federal agencies and other existing data resources available to the consultant.  Contemporaneously, NCPC staff will be compiling data on the existing supply of federal space.

The consultant will need to consider official, unofficial, and projected space needs for the federal government in the District to determine the amount and type of space needed, as well as the micro-locational needs for that space.  NCPC is primarily interested in office space, but we also seek information on key space needs to meet the full range of federal operations, such as light industrial and research.  The study is not intended to address long-term needs for space associated with parks and open space, foreign missions and memorials and museums.

The study should be comprehensive in considering demand for the executive branch of the government - but also seek coordination for the projected demand for the executive, legislative, and judiciary.  The study should also consider the need for space and land for co-located federal contractors and other federally-contracted services.  This phase covers federal demand for land and facilities in the District; subsequent work efforts by NCPC may consider:  1) the supply of land and facilities available to the federal government in the District and 2) supply and demand issues in the national capital region.

The consultant will compile the data necessary to determine the demand for federal facilities in the District of Columbia over the next ten years.  The consultant shall provide an analysis that provides both a total square footage estimate of owned and leased space (or alternative metric as recommended by the consultant and agreed to by NCPC prior to the start of the study), as well as more detailed breakdown which filters the demand using space attributes such as locational needs and design parameters which may influence or restrict where and how such facilities are located within the District.

NCPC will facilitate meetings and calls with the relevant federal stakeholders to assist in obtaining this information.  The consultant will also use other information sources available through the private sector, and the consultant should take into consideration the demand for government leased space.  The consultant should utilize commercially available real estate industry standard information resources, including trade publications, journals, modeling software and other applicable resources.  While some information is readily available from existing sources, other output may require the creation of new analytical techniques or unique tools not currently developed.  One anticipated difficulty in the study is that the unit of space measurement is likely to be inconsistent among different agencies and departments.  The consultant will need to formulate a consistent and reliable unit of measurement for disparate federal space needs which may be based on square footage, acreage, space per employee, or some combination of measures.  NCPC will determine the most appropriate metric to be used for the study, but we solicit recommendations from the consultant in this proposal.

NCPC will convene a peer group of agencies and stakeholders to assist NCPC in working with the consultant and reviewing the consultant products.  NCPC will manage this group and serve as the single point of contact, but  require that the consultants participate in at least one meeting with this group.

Due to the sensitive nature of specific agency planning needs and the release of information prior to coordination with Congress and the Office of Management and Budget, it will be necessary to report aggregate data for many aspects of this study.  Where appropriate, differences in reporting procedures by GSA and other federal agencies should be explained in order to allow a full understanding of the information presented.

QUALIFICATIONS
Offerors must have familiarity with and access to economic data and forecasts specific to the Washington, D.C. region.  
Specifically, NCPC is looking for a consultant with the following skills and characteristics:

1.Extensive experience analyzing the recent history and trends shaping land use conditions, the federal workforce, and the real estate market in the NCR, particularly in regards to the federal government. 
2.The consultant will have to have expertise in demographic studies, information services, and databases that cover the NCR.  
3.Familiarity with and access to real estate and economic data and forecasts specific to the NCR. 
4.Demonstrated expertise in conducting analyses of aggregate federal real estate and facility data in the NCR.
5.Demonstrated experience in collecting and analyzing information on federal agency criteria for locating facilities, land and space acquisitions/leasing, or similar information, in the NCR.
6.Knowledge of and access to prior studies, agency plans, and research relating to federal space needs and trends in the NCR.
7.Expertise with the process(es) federal agencies use to determine their land, space, and facility requirements, what factors influence those decisions, and what timeframes are customarily used for future planning purposes.
8.Expertise on how headquarters facilities and secured-space facilities differ from other types of federal facilities in space and location needs.
9.Capacity to analyze federal workspace trends to establish need projections for the future.
10.Ability to conduct work so the collection of data and any necessary interviews or meetings do not require the consultant to incur extensive travel expenses. 

BUDGET
This proposal is budgeted for no more than $50,000.

SCOPE OF WORK
NCPC proposes the following schedule of tasks for completion of the study.  Successful proposals will address the tasks identified below, but may also make recommendations for refining the tasks to better address the research and analysis needed, and to accomplish the goals of the study as stated above.  After award of the contract, but prior to commencement of the first task, the consultant and NCPC will confer on the final scope of work as detailed in the contract.

Consultants will be expected to meet with the NCPC Project team to discuss progress and review completed tasks after each stage of the scope of work.  Consultants may be asked to formally present the completed study to the Commission and/or an interagency task force.

Review prior studies and prepare work plan.
The consultant should conduct a review of all prior studies, agency plans, and research relating to federal space needs and trends in the District.  The goal of this task is twofold.  First, to avoid duplication of previous efforts and set a baseline for available space data and planning.  Second, to establish any federal workspace trends likely to continue into the next decade.

Deliverable: The consultant will provide NCPC with a summary of existing data on federal space needs and a detailed list of the specific studies, plans, and data currently available.

Narrative of demand requirements.
In this task the consultant will describe the process(es) federal agencies use to determine their land, space, and facility requirements, what factors influence those decisions, and what timeframes are customarily used for future planning purposes.  The consultant will describe how other federal landholders identify short-, medium-, and long-range needs for federally occupied space in the District.  The consultant will also explain micro-locational criteria such as proximity to other federal facilities (including the White House and the Capitol), the need for custom designed space, transit accessibility, security requirements, visibility.  The consultant will describe how headquarters facilities and secured space facilities differ from other types of federal facilities functions in size, design, and location needs. The consultant will also describe how technological advances have changed facility requirements.  The consultant will also describe additional design and development criteria not previously addressed.

Deliverable: The consultant will provide NCPC with a written report on federal space requirements for the purpose of determining demand for federal facilities.  

Data Collection.
The consultant will collect the data necessary to produce a 10-year demand analysis for federal agencies in the District of Columbia.  This will include reviewing the federal workspace trends in the past six years as identified above to establish likely need projections for the future.  This task will also review historical federal space decisions and practices, particularly of the past six years, to determine if there are past or emerging trends likely to influence future decisions.  However, NCPC is mindful that recent past trends may not be indicative of the need for federal space in the near term, as recent security concerns, budget limitations, and national and international issues in the past 5 years may have led to a postponement of acquiring or leasing new space.  NCPC is interested in reviewing recent federal space trends and determining if they would be useful in forecasting future space projections.

This task requires the consultant to review recent changes to workspace requirements (such as the need for more secure facilities, or any identifiable trends toward leased versus owned space) and official and unofficial micro-locational desires of federal agencies and departments.  NCPC seeks information and conclusions regarding the federal agency preferences, if any, for leased versus owner space.  There are two potential methods for data collection - interviews conducted by a joint team of the consultant and NCPC staff, or interviews conducted by NCPC staff alone using a questionnaire developed jointly by NCPC and the consultant.  The latter method offers an opportunity to minimize consultant hours on interviews and maximize consultant talent on the analysis.  The consultant's proposal should specify which method is preferred and include that method in the proposal.  However, NCPC will make a final decision regarding the interviews in consultation with the winning consultant.  Potential interviewees include federal agency space planners and private sector real estate market experts.

Deliverable: The consultant will provide a summary of recent federal facility demand trends and a written report of current federal facility requirements to the extent they are relevant for establishing an understanding of the federal facility demand in the District.

Data Analysis.
The consultant will analyze the actual and projected space requirements for federal agencies in the District.  Identify and analyze the data collected in the previous task to determine the future 10-year space requirements of these agencies and others seeking sites in the District. The consultant should forecast demand by government branch, by short- (approximately 2-year), mid- (approximately 5-year), and long-term (approximately 10-year) time frames, to the extent that this information is made available by government agencies.  NCPC will coordinate with the consultant to confirm the format for reporting forecasting information, recognizing that many issues will be addressed in the narrative section (discussed below).  NCPC anticipates that the demand forecast will include projections provided in square footage or comparable numbers; forecast demand for secured space and headquarters space; and aggregate demand for major use categories, such as office, research and development, and light industrial.

Deliverable: The consultant will provide a demand forecast for federal facilities in the District for short-, mid-, and long-terms.  NCPC seeks a projection for federal facility demand expressed in need for square feet of space and a more detailed breakdown of space needs to account for any micro-locational criteria or space attributes that would restrict where the facility can be located.

Recommendations for Future Data Development. 
The consultant will briefly discuss the current availability of data, as well as issues and limitations on existing data (gaps, differences in collection between different agencies, reporting limitations due to security needs).  The consultant will make recommendations for future data development that NCPC could conduct.

Deliverable: The consultant will make recommendations to NCPC for how existing data gaps can be addressed to facilitate future planning research and policy-making.

Federal facility demand report.
In this task the consultant will prepare a final federal facility demand report for NCPC.  This task will incorporate the information collected, analyzed and developed in the previous tasks and will utilize both narrative and graphic formats to explain in non-technical terms the findings of the study.  The report will include a discussion regarding the amount of land that is reasonable to meet unknown and/or future needs. The report will be presented to NCPC in draft form for NCPC staff review and comment before the final version is authorized to be completed.  NCPC retains final authority regarding public review and distribution of the final report, all data collected during the course of the study, the analysis completed, and any conclusions from the study. 

Deliverable: The consultant will prepare a draft report summarizing the research completed and the conclusions reached.  The consultant will present the study's findings to the stakeholder peer group and possibly the Commission.  After the presentation, the consultant must allow time for review and comment.  NCPC staff will collect federal stakeholder comments and convey them to the consultant.  The consultant will address all of the comments to NCPC's satisfaction; the consultant will prepare a final report to summarize the research completed, the comments received, and the conclusions reached.  

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
NCPC will examine the existing supply of land and space in the District available to meet federal needs.  The consultant will review NCPC's scope of work and provide criteria and recommendations to ensure that the products of this work effort can be effectively used together with the consultant's work products.  

The consultant's proposal may suggest and include additional tasks in the scope of work not identified in this proposal that would be relevant and or useful to satisfy the study's goal and accurately estimate federal space needs in the District over the upcoming decade.  The proposed scope of work is set out as a framework for the study, but NCPC is open to recommendations if there are more effective and efficient methodologies to accomplish the stated goal.  In no event shall the final proposal be greater than the stated budgeted amount of $50,000.

TIMELINE FOR COMPLETION
This contract is expected to begin in October 2006 and be completed no later than March 2007.

FINAL PRODUCT
The consultant will provide the final report NCPC in an electronic Word format.  NCPC will complete the final formatting of the document for publication.  The consultant will provide NCPC with all of the collected data in a format acceptable to NCPC.  The consultant can not use any of the data or research that they obtain through this study unless they receive prior approval from NCPC.

The contract type will be Firm-Fixed price and Time and Material.

III.	Description of Supplies/Services

AFIT/ENE is looking to address a number of areas for improvement in it?s? academic records management system (ARMS).  In order to support the establishment of a standard ARMS for use by all of Air University (AU), AFIT requires the Hershey Systems, Singularity Transcript Module Academic Records Management System being used by and Community College of the Air Force (CCAF), and that will provide the following functions and features:

1.	Provide full featured document capture supporting bar-code capabilities and extended batch capture and indexing capabilities.

2.	Provide a robust capture system for scanning and extracting data from hard  copy transcripts.

3.	Identify duplicate and supplemental transcripts to achieve greater productivity. 
4.	Provide ability to send and receive transcripts using any of the currently available encoding protocols.
5.	Provide integration capabilities with nearly any student ERP system whether open, legacy or custom.
6.	Be a highly scalable, fully encapsulated web-based application infrastructure incorporating an imaging repository, imaging editing functionality, collaborative workflow, and rapid development functionality.  
IV.	Authority

10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302.1(c)
V.	Applicability of Authority

The Air Force Institute of Technology?s Graduate School of Engineering and Management has a critical requirement to digitize all of it?s academic records, and leverage workflow management software and technology to significantly improve admissions processes and make more efficient use of scare resources.  As part of the Air Force?s initiative to reshape the force and make resources available to recapitalize/modernize aging weapons systems, AFIT will reduce its manning.  
As a part of Air University (AU), AFIT has a requirement to utilize AU standard academic products that meet our mission requirements and that are implemented by other elements of AU to the greatest extent possible.  In 2005, the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) acquired the Singularity program developed by Hershey to manage their academic records.  Representatives from AFIT visited CCAF to observe the program?s operation, and to verify that it will meet our requirements.  It was determined by our technical and functional experts that Hershey?s Singularity program acquired and used by the CCAF will indeed satisfy all of AFIT?s academic records maintenance and workflow management requirements. 

The Singularity suite of software is the only known product that offers the complete functionality that AFIT requires, that is 100% compatible with the CCAF?s  
VI.	Efforts to Obtain Competition

Synopsis of Proposed Actions:  Yes

Other Actions:  See below Paragraph VIII ? Market Research
VII.	Fair and Reasonable Costs

Fair and reasonable price determination will be made based upon the results from various tools such as market research, historical information and 	reviewing other contracts for similar work.
VIII.	Market Research

To prevent future acquisitions of this type, AFIT will continue to monitor 	technical developments in this field and conduct market surveys to determine alternate sources of supply.

IX.	Other Facts

The Singularity suite of software is the only known product that offers the complete functionality that AFIT requires, that is 100% compatible with the CCAF?s ARMS without any modification or tailoring, and is being successfully used by other universities.  AFIT has been unable to find any other system that meets all of these requirements.  AFIT has a requirement to use the same ARMS being implemented by other units in Air University (AU) in order to achieve AU?s  vision of a common system for the entire AU complex.   If the Singularity suite is not purchased, then AFIT will be forced to continue to use the slow, and inefficient procedure of collecting paper copies of documents from potential students, route the paper files manually through the graduate school for review, and then maintain storage of all of the paper files.  This manual process is not able to respond in a time frame required by the Air Force Personnel Center(AFPC) in support of making military member selections for an AFIT assignment.  Currently AFIT is often forced to consider candidates without complete records because it would take too long to acquire the paper copies from institutions.  This has resulted in some students attending AFIT that are less than fully qualified, and has placed them at increased risk of academic failure.  The Singluarity suite will permit AFIT to receive records from institutions electronically in a matter of hours vs weeks,  will permit rapid dissemination of records within the school for faculty and administration review, and will enable AFIT to meet the short time line required by AFPC to make school selections.  Additionally, Singularity will provide the ability for officers to review their academic records on-line using web based technology. This will significantly reduce the time it takes for an officer to be notified that they are missing a document so they can acquire the document electronically from another institution in order to support their consideration for advanced academic degree education.  Singularity will also be capable of replacing an ineffective system currently being used to manage the Air Force Officer Education Repository and will save AFIT over $5,000 a year in software license fees by not having to maintain two separate systems.

X.	Interested Sources

We are not aware of any other interested sources for supplying this product, based upon the efforts to date.
XI.	Steps to Foster Competition

AFIT will continue to query for commercially available software of this kind to determine if the capabilities meet the government's requirements.  We will review technical publications, attend trade shows, and confer with other users so that future actions will be under full and open competition procedures.
XII.	Contracting Officer?s Certification

The contracting officer?s signature on the Brand Name Justification signature page evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.
XIII.	Technical/Requirements Personnel?s Certification

As evidenced by their signatures on the Brand Name Justification signature page, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein which is their responsibility is both accurate and complete.

As a part of Air University (AU), it is important that, to the greatest extent possible, AFIT utilize standard AU academic products that meet our mission requirements and that are implemented by other elements of AU.  In 2005, the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) acquired the Singularity program developed by Hershey to manage their academic records.  Representatives from AFIT visited CCAF to observe the program?s operation, and to verify that it will meet our requirements.  It was determined by our technical and functional experts that Hershey?s Singularity program acquired and used by the CCAF will indeed satisfy all of AFIT?s academic records maintenance and workflow management requirements. 

Additionally, transcript processing templates developed for CCAF will be available to AFIT as a result of using the common system which will significantly reduce the total cost of ownership for AFIT.  Acquiring Singularity from Hershey will provide AFIT the leading document management, workflow and e-forms solution for higher education, and  the same system being employed by CCAF.

Items that do not confirm to descriptions and part numbers found in this RFQ will be rejec 0044 ted at the time of delivery causing a return at the vendors expense. Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after submission New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products Agencies may require registration with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to receipt of order. Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s Production Support Upgrades project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server and components meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: · Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management · Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health · Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks · Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives · Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers · Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) · CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting · 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives · Systems must have front video/USB ports · Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources · Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED.

CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED. REMOVED DUPLICATE LINE ITEMS.  INSERTED CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENT

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ 263-2006-Q-FX-0224 and is being issued as a request quote.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and is a small-business set-aside. NIH intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Miriam C. Kelty 6709 Slekirk Dr. Bethesda, MD 20817. The requirement consists of updating, reviewing, and maintaining the Bioethics Resources site. Mrs. Kelty originally set up the site as part of the Inter-Institute Bioethics Interest Group activities. The site is replete with resources available to those with an interest in bioethics including education, research involving human participants and animals, medical and health care ethics, and the implications of applied genetics and biotechnology. This website contains a broad collage of annotated web links, and while this list is comprehensive, it is not totally inclusive. The listed resources provide background information and various positions on issues in bioethics.  
In addition, the contractor will be required to provide the following services. 	

	
1.	Shall review and update Bioethics Resources on the web.

2.	Shall review all content for currency and appropriateness.

3.	Shall add material to each category as needed.  This shall include review of recent literature, policy material and training curricula or opportunities.

4.	Shall review main categories on website to determine whether they should be retained.  This shall be done in consultation with OSP staff.

5.	Shall add new main category headings and populate new categories/topics.  These shall reflect adding material about newly emerging ethical issues in science.

6.	Shall maintain and upkeep the site.

7.	Shall review web literature and printed journals to identify new resource material that should be added to Bioethics Resources.

8.	Review all content for currency and appropriateness

9.	Add material to each category as needed.  This includes review of recent literature, policy material and training curricula or opportunities

10.	Review main categories on website to determine whether they should be retained.  This would be done in consultation with OSP staff

11.	Add new main category headings and populate new categories/topics.  These would reflect adding material about newly emerging ethical issues in science.

12.	Review web literature and printed journals to identify new resource material that should be added to Bioethics Resources 

The period of performance is 
For 12 months starting at contract award. This requisition is less than the Simplified threshold.  These services will be performed under a government-wide contract. Mrs. Kelty is the only party known to NIH that can meet the above requirements for the existing system, she has extensive knowledge of and experience in the ethics of research, and specific expertise in research ethics as it relates to NIH activities.  Her knowledge of the resource needs of the NIH scientific community as a whole, her expertise in the ethics of research and her inside knowledge of the NIH coupled with her first-hand experience with developing and maintaining the existing website makes Mrs. Kelty uniquely qualified for this acquisition. A sole source is warranted to maintain the continuity of the environment, avoid service disruptions and provide the best value to the government.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541690. The proposed contract is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all quotes received in this office by 4:00 p.m. EST on the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Quotes shall be sent to: (a) if mailing your capabilities through the U.S. Postal Service use the following address: National Institutes of Health, Office of Logistics and Acquisition Operations, OA, 6011 Executive Blvd., Rm# 529I, Attn: Wendy Rivera, Bethesda, MD 20892. Telephone: 301-435-3919; fax: 301-480-1137 (b) if hand delivering, or using a courier services such as: UPS, Federal Express, use the following City, state and Zip Code: Rockville, MD 20852 (c) by email: Riveraw@od.nih.gov

1.0 BACKGROUND:  The mission of the Defense Finance & Accounting Services Rome is to produce timely and accurate disbursements to the Department of Defense personnel, their dependants and commercial concerns. Automation support varies with in each directorate at all DFAS sites, but every function depends heavily upon telecommunications services to respond to customer needs.  DFAS needs to provide better customer service while reducing costs by upgrading the Nortel 61C Public Branch Exchange (PBX) at Rome.  Currently telephony support is provided by the Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site (AFRL). The Rome Labs Director has determined that they no longer desire to support DFAS Rome.  This means that DFAS Rome requires its own PBX for telephony support.

Statement of Work:
A.  BACKGROUND
The Congressional Research Service (CRS), a service unit of the Library of Congress, works exclusively for the United States Congress, providing research, analysis, and information support to the members and committees of the House and Senate.  These services are provided by a highly educated staff of policy analysts, information specialists, and other professionals.

The mission of CRS is to provide to the Congress, throughout the legislative process, comprehensive and reliable legislative research, analysis and information services that are timely, non-partisan, and confidential, thereby contributing to an informed national legislature.  The vision of CRS is that the Congress turns to CRS first when it is in need of legislative, research analysis or information in addressing the issues of the Nation.  As an organization, CRS has adopted the values of client service, uncompromising integrity, total quality, mutual respect, and diversity.

As part of its ongoing efforts to ensure that CRS provides the highest possible quality of support to the Congress, CRS carries out a comprehensive training program to improve the knowledge base of CRS staff in a number of areas, including best practices in mentoring.

In 1999, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) Director established a Working Group to focus on mentoring activities that would further the Service’s goal to enhance diversity and to assist with succession planning.  This Working Group recommended the establishment of a formal CRS Mentor Program that would provide guidance to new employees by more experienced employees and facilitate support from management and staff to carry out that instruction.

As a result of their work, the Working Group recommended that the CRS Mentor Program develop a high quality, diverse workforce that values information exchange and encourages a creative and productive work environment.  The principle vehicle for this program commitment was that new employees would work closely with more experienced employees who would serve as role models to help new hires work effectively, make personal adjustments, and move forward in his/her careers.

B.  SCOPE OF WORK
To ensure that CRS staff have the training and tools they need to provide the highest quality analytical work for the Congress, CRS requires assistance in developing and delivering: (1)  on-site, customized Mentor/Mentee training as part of the implementation of the Mentor Program in CRS; (2) customized orientation to the CRS Mentor Program for the CRS Research Policy Council (RPC); and (3) a Mentor/Mentee Handbook based upon the customized mentor/mentee training program -- to be used as a training guide for new employees hired after the initial training program has been delivered.

C.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
The target audience for the Mentor/Mentee training will be the mentees –  newly hired CRS staff, including but not limited to analysts, attorneys, information specialists, and administrative personnel;  and mentors – experienced CRS employees.  The target audience for the customized orientation to the Mentor Program will be the Resource Policy Council (RPC) – senior level managers.
The learning objectives for the Mentor/Mentee training that must be met include, but are not limited to:
•Understanding the goals of the mentoring relationship in the context of CRS’s Mentor Program;
•Understanding mentoring, i.e., what it is and isn’t;
•Understanding the roles/responsibilities and expectations of mentors and mentees;
•Understanding the steps in establishing a meaningful mentoring relationship in initiating the mentoring process;
•Identifying a process for helping mentees solve problems; and
•Developing mentoring skills.
To provide the necessary assistance with this project, the contractor will: (1) meet with a representative group of CRS senior managers to assess CRS’s needs for course content, exercises, and case studies; (2) design a customized Mentor/Mentee training course; (3) design a customized orientation to the Mentor Program for CRS Resource Policy Council; (4) develop a customized Mentor/Mentee Handbook and course materials; (5)  present an orientation session for the RPC and  a pilot training course; 6) present up to three training courses that implement the final course design.

<DESC>The choice of VCR and DVD (eg, RS232 control) implies that you have a control system requirement but none in mentioned.  Pleae clarify your requirements on these issues and provide requirements for touchpanel (size, wired/wireless) and control capabilities.

No control system requirement was mentioned because none was chosen for this solicitation.  However, there were reasons for choosing a DVD & VCR with RS-232 control capabilitites, even in the absense of a control system. These reasons are as follows: 

1) RS232 capability in these devices, or in equipment that's added in the future, would provide a common control capablility, and allow for a control system to be added later should the room need to be upgraded.

2) Both RS232 devices (DVD & VCR) are professional grade equipment,  and as a general rule, are built better than comparable consumer grade equipment. These should stand up better over time to either heavy or light usage.

<DESC>This Amendment #02 is sissued to post answers to questions (5-11) (1-4 was posted in amendment 01) concerning solicitation #  R1WH17000607, Laser Scanning of the USS San Antonio ship board space and associated vehicles and cargo.  
Question #5.  For the "Full Volumetric Scans" identified on Page 8, do you know which vehicles will be scanned at which sites?  Is there any further definition of the list of vehicles? ***** 
Answer # 5.  No.  The RFP lists the vehicles/equipment and possible locations.  Travel will be cost-reimbursable.********** 
Question #6.  Can we assume a relatively low level of visual obstruction for the internal shipboard compartments?  For example, will the spaces not contain any of the larger vehicles? ***** 
Answer #6.  Whether or not there are vehicles onboard is not addressed in this task. That is up to the ship and what is loaded onboard at the ship at that time.  Yes, you may assume a relatively low level of visual obstruction although there will be no guarantee of it. **********  
Question #7.  Should we assume 1st shift (daytime) access for the scanning operations and how long of a day can we operate?  Should we expect any interruptions in scanning due to normal shipboard activity? ***** 
Answer#7.  Since there is no exact date as yet to initiate the scanning portion, once the contract is awarded to the successful offeror, the logistical aspects of work hours so as not to effect ship schedules will be adhered to and/or will be worked out prior to arrival onboard with ship personnel by the awarding government office's representative and the successful offeror. For proposal purposes, utilize normal daytime/non-premium and expect no interruptions during normal shipboard activity.  It is impossible to predict the future. ********** 
Question #8.  Does each shipboard compartment contain existing dimensional control points?  If so roughly how many?  Are they sufficient for obtaining shipboard coordinate control?  Will the coordinate values for these control points be provided? *****
Answer #8.  There are no dimension control points provided by the US Navy. It will be up to the winning offeror to set. ********** 
Question #9.  We would like to get a better understanding on the level of resolution required for the scanning and CAD modeling of the compartments and vehicles.  For example for the internal shipboard spaces, do you need any existing piping, electrical panels, hatch rims, lighting fixtures, or any other non-structural features? ***** 
Answer #9.  The task is to provide a scan of the each compartment listed, the whole compartment including any equipment/material permanently installed onboard. ********** 
Question #10.  Will we be able to use any on-board manlifts, ladders, or platforms for the scanning?  Will we have access to on-board conventional power?  Can we store equipment in the evenings in a secure space? *****
Answer #10.  No, the scan equipment is owned and operated by the winning offeror and the equipment is under his or her care for the time onboard the ship. The shipboard equipment is owned by the ship and not available to civilians. There will not be any Government provided equipment and if compatible, power may be provided.  The Government will not be responsible for the contractors equipment.**********
Question #11.  Can we submit with our proposal an example of our 3D animations and CAD modeling created from previous related scanning projects? ***** 
Answer #11.  You can, but it will not affect the review against this specific task and it may not be looked at by the evaluation team as the Government may not have the specific software to view it.**********
  
All proposals (to include completely filled in past performance reports) shall be e-mailed to the Contracting Officer Doug Punzel at Douglas.Punzel@gsa.gov (617-565-5769)AND Jim Fahey  at James.Fahey@gsa.gov(617-565-5170).  This amendment to issue additional answers to questions does NOT extend the proposal due date.  Proposals must be received by e-mail no later than Sep 14, 2006, 3:00 PM EST.

The following Amendment 0005 is hereby issued to administer the changes described herein:
1.  Correct the response date in Amendment 0004 to 15 September 2006
2.  Clean up the description due to computer generated errors in Amendment 0004:
CLIN 0001 - The description and material have changed as follows:
CLIN 0001: Cross-Sheen Porcelain Tile. Contractors shall provide pricing for the following qualified product: Crossville 'Cross-Sheen' porcelain tile category: (1) regular field tile 11,007 SF, size 12inch x 12inch, five sixteenth inch thick, style Sea Mist A585; (2) custom heavy field tile one half inch thick, 3,500SF , size 12inch x 12inch style Sea Mist A585; (3) Border tiles 3,500SF, size 12inch x 12inch, five sixteenth inch thick, style Lapis B180.  Contractor shall provide and install cross-sheen porcelain tile deck covering. No QPL or Mil-Spec currently exists for these materials. All products must meet the requirements of commercial standard A137.1.  A copy of this standard can be obtained from: Tile Council of America, Inc., 100 Clemson Research Blvd., Anderson, SC 29625, phone: 864-646-8453, fax:864-646-2821, URL: http:/www.tileusa.com. Contractor shall remove existing deck covering down to bare metal surface.  Prepare and prime deck surface in accordance with NSTM Section 631.     Install an underlayment, adhesive and grout that is epoxy based.  The cement based underlayment products available will not hold up under forklift traffic. The compressive strength is not high enough, and the underlayment has been seen to crumble, leading to failures and breakage of the porcelain tiles.  Additionally, the underlayment may not fully cure in the center of the non-permeable tiles. Therefore, contractor shall provide ultra-lightweight underlayment (<1.0 lb/sf @ 1/4") that meets QPL-3135, Type II, Class 2, and that the adhesive and grout are also epoxy based.  Install approved underlayment to level surface and cover any raised areas across the surface area.  Install new porcelain tiles throughout entire areas specified iaw best commercial standards for this type of product and the fact that it is being installed on board a U.S. Navy ship.  Contractor shall understand how critical this deck leveling stage is to the overall success of the installation.  An non-leveled surface could result in deck failure and be reason for contract default for latent defect and or non-conformance to the specifications herein.  Recommend using a 3/8 notched trowel and contractor shall back butter the tile 100% for a nice level setting bed when installing border and field tiles.  Ship's representative shall choose final design.

Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Ac cess Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holiday s, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cem ent concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given prior ity.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North F ort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its  drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation t hrough any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through th e Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Ac cess Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed ac cess only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort L ewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the empl oyee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Ma in (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor emplo yees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access  identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor  employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pas s; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longe r needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification ba dge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Go vernment installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification ba dges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copi ed by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor empl oyee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be us ed for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAG PC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the co ntractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.
