<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Iron Mountain, 1137 Branchton Road, P.O. Box 6, Boyers, PA 16020 for the storage of the following materials:

·Processed, exposed silver gelatin negative motion picture film (approximately 4,000 reels, averaging 500-600 additional reels to be added per year and one or more large shipments of unprocessed reels) in a climate-controlled (constant 35ºF / 25% RH) below-ground vault with a conditioning anteroom (constant 55ºF / 40% RH);
·Processed, exposed silver gelatin camera negative microfilm (over 55,000 reels, averaging 4,000 additional reels to be added per year) and magnetic tape (over 500 cassettes, various sizes and formats, with varying amounts of additional items to be added per year) in a separate climate-controlled (constant 55ºF / 30% RH) belowground vault.

This is a continuation of existing services being procured under FAR 13.105(b).  The Period of Performance will be for a base year with four successive one-year options.  Iron Mountain will: (1) provide, exclusively for NLM’s use, a secure, clean, regularly monitored and well-maintained storage environment for acetate-based reels of motion picture film, many of which are unique and not available from any other U.S. medical libraries; (2) provide, exclusively for NLM’s use, a secure, clean, regularly monitored and well-maintained storage environment for 35mm silver-gelatin camera master acetate- and polyester-based microfilm reels, many of which are unique and irreplaceable; (3)  accommodate magnetic tapes and additional material as required by NLM; (4) provide disaster prevention and protection for the vaults, anteroom and NLM’s stored materials; (5) arrange for annual independent party air quality sampling in the vaults and anteroom; (6) conduct a routine program of safety inspections and equipment maintenance and repair for the electrical, fire alarm and HVAC systems connected to the vaults and anteroom; (7) provide on-site security for NLM’s vaults and stored materials; (8) provide adequate and appropriate shelving and furnishings for the storage and access of NLM materials; (9) provide round trip courier service with 24-hour turnaround time for the pickup and delivery of NLM materials being shipped to or from the vaults; (10) observe all NLM stipulations regarding conditioning of film materials prior to placement in, or subsequent to removal from the motion picture vault; (11) maintain detailed, accurate inventories of stored NLM materials; (12) maintain and operate hygrothermographs in the vaults and provide the Library with copies of completed charts on a regular basis; (13) provide the Library with periodic reports concerning ongoing vault performance and detailing reasons for out-of-spec temperature or relative humidity conditions, including steps taken to replace or repair worn-out or malfunctioning equipment.  In addition to being provided with stable low temperature and relative humidity, the vaults shall be maintained with a slightly positive air pressure and a specified periodic influx of fresh air, and shall be filtered as specified in national standards and library and archive recommended practice to protect NLM materials from the potentially destructive effects of pollutants including airborne particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, formaldehyde, peroxides and ammonia.  The storage environment must also be monitored for the presence of acetic acid that may be off-gassed from acetate-based films.

Iron Mountain is the only known source to provide NLM with high quality storage and service in all the areas specified in this synopsis, and continues to meet national and NLM standards for film storage.  Most of the materials stored in the vaults are unique and irreplaceable.   Belowground storage provides not only constant temperature (making it less difficult to maintain stable conditions), but provides an added measure of security.  Further, it is widely acknowledged in national and international standards, technical photographic literature and library and archives preservation literature that processed silver gelatin emulsion film is a fragile medium subject to irreversible life-expectancy reduction when subjected for extended periods of time to fluctuations of temperature and humidity beyond recommended ranges.  Due to the relative instability of their constituent ingredients, acetate-based film materials have a considerably shorter life expectancy that polyester-based films, making them still more vulnerable.  Additionally, exposure to light, particulate matter and gaseous pollutants is potentially destructive to the sensitive emulsion layers of films, regardless of the film base.  Iron Mountain has designed and built two vaults, each complete with its own independent HVAC, air filtration system, fire suppression system, and water detection system.  The vaults have been proven to be capable of meeting NLM’s extended term storage conditions.   Iron Mountain has been providing this service to NLM for over 15 years.

This service will be procured under FAR Part 12 (Commercial Items).  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm’s ability to meet the Government’s requirements.  Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No.03-189/KS shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Kala Shankar, Contract Specialist (301) 496 6546 or Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, (301) 496 6546.

Sole Source Justification for Cooled Panel 3D Weave Purchase NASA GRC is pushing the technology limits in the design and manufacture of woven ceramic fiber composite heat exchangers for next generation propulsion systems.  This technology requires a preform manufacturer who is very aggressive in the use of advanced machinery for complex shapes and material property definition for engineering analysis.	The final product must be designed in a carefully orchestrated fashion between manufacturing, material research, and structural engineering.	The weavers must also have the capability to produce complex 3-D woven parts with a thickness greater than 0.3”.   Albany International Techniweave is uniquely qualified to produce machine woven 3-D shapes for NASA’s heat exchanger development program. AIT has 5 Jacquard weaving machines configured for handling ceramic and other difficult to handle fibers. In addition, AIT has developed a proprietary weaving and property prediction code called Techniweaver® that allows user’s a graphics interface to design the part and at the same time produce the electronic weaving instructions for the loom. No one else has this capability or experience in producing parts of this complexity. AIT developed the unique methods required to handle and weave the high modulus silicon carbide fibers required for the present program. NASA will not have to expend additional time or money for other weavers to develop the capabilities unique to AIT.  We will also be assured of consistent properties in our products which adds to the continuity of our research.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 08 AUGUST, 2003.

<DESC>NOAA's National Ocean Service's Office of Coast Survey requires an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) for hydrographic surveying. The basic requirement is for a vehicle capable of acquiring vertical beam echosounder data of the AUV's vertical position in the water column from both the surface and the sea floor (bottom), high resolution side scan sonar imagery, velocity of the AUV through the water, and conductivity, temperature, and depth data while operating independently from it's mother vessel.  The vehicle must be sufficiently robust to be operated and maintained in the field by relatively inexperienced technicians and as such NOAA requires that the AUV be a commercial-off-the-shelf product.  Minor modifications to a standard package to customize its sensors to meet the NOAA requirements are acceptable, but a completely new designed package to meet the requirements is not acceptable.  To receive a copy of the solicitation, you must register with the FedBizOpps' "register to receive notification" feature.  Once you have registered, the FBO will send you email notification when the solicitation becomes available for download.  Our office WILL NOT be issuing paper copies, registering with the FBO will be the only means of obtaining the RFP.  For further questions, please contact Stephanie Kyles at the contact information provided in this announcement.

<DESC>Force Application and Launch from CONUS (FALCON) Phase I, BAA03-35. The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for Phase I of a three phase joint DARPA/Air Force FALCON program.  The FALCON program is pursuing development and demonstration of near-term (2010) capabilities, such as Common Aero Vehicle (CAV) and Small Launch Vehicle (SLV), while pursuing advancements toward long-term (2025) capabilities such as the Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle (HCV).  In addition to this BAA and before submitting proposals, a prospective offeror MUST refer to the FALCON Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at the DARPA website, WWW.DARPA.MIL/BAA for further information.  The FALCON PIP contains additional details regarding the Program Description, Phase I Statement of Objectives, Proposal Preparation Instructions, and Evaluation Criteria for Award. OVERALL PROGRAM GOAL AND VISION: The overall goal of the joint DARPA/Air Force FALCON program is to develop and validate, in-flight, technologies that will enable both near-term and far-term capability to execute time-critical, prompt global reach missions while at the same time, demonstrating affordable and responsive space lift.  The Government envisions near-term conventional global strike capability via development of CAV, a rocket boosted munitions delivery system that delivers its payload to the target by executing unpowered glide maneuvers at hypersonic speed.  The Government envisions development of a low-cost, responsive launch system called SLV that is capable of boosting a CAV to its requisite pierce point conditions.  The FALCON program will pursue the development, integration, and progressive demonstration of the critical and enabling technologies and system attributes leading to an operational CAV/SLV system.  A second, but equally important, envisioned capability of the SLV is to place small satellites into low Earth orbit. For this application, the SLV must be at least an order of magnitude more responsive than existing satellite launch systems and must have a low launch cost.  The FALCON program will pursue development of innovative SLV concepts possessing these attributes and demonstration of the integrated set of key enabling technologies in a sub-orbital flight demonstration.  The program will also seek to develop a unique CONOPS that will support and enable both the responsiveness and low-cost system objectives of SLV.  Far-term conventional prompt global strike capability is envisioned as a CONUS-based, reusable, HCV.  Reusability and aircraft-like operations are critical to far-term affordable and flexible prompt global strike capability.  In order to achieve this capability, the FALCON program will pursue the design, development, integration, and demonstration of critical and enabling technologies and system attributes pertaining to a reusable, operational HCV. PHASE I DESCRIPTION: Phase I is a six month effort.  Two tasks are being offered in this BAA; Task 1 is SLV, and Task 2 is Hypersonic Weapon Systems (HWS).  The Phase I Task 1, SLV, objective is to solicit technical approaches for SLV design(s) suitable for launching either a global range CAV (Enhanced CAV) with an approximate 1,000 pound munitions payload or a small satellite to a specified low Earth orbit.  Phase I products will include conceptual booster designs, performance predictions, and CONOPS and ROM costs for development and operation.  The Phase I Task 2, HWS, objective is to develop the conceptual designs for the CAV, Enhanced CAV, and HCV which optimize the Air Force warfighting requirements and operational capabilities; performance requirements; munitions weight, volume and high speed dispense requirements; and launch alternatives.  Phase I products will include an integrated demonstration plan including ROM costs to execute, critical technology identification and maturation plan, and conceptual demonstrator designs for the hypersonic weapon systems.  Offerors are directed to the PIP for further information. FUNDING: Total funding for Phase I (Tasks 1, and 2) of this solicitation is $7.0M.  The government anticipates awarding multiple Phase I agreements/contracts for each task described within this solicitation.  It is anticipated that four to five SLV agreements or contracts will be awarded with a government contribution of $0.3M to $0.54M per award, and three to four HWS agreements or contracts with a government contribution of $1.2M to $1.5M per award.  The Offeror is expected to provide a realistic technical and cost proposal for best achieving the program objectives within the outlined budget and schedule.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and fund portions of proposals if warranted.  Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in FALCON technology. AWARD INSTRUMENT AND EVALUATION APPROACH: The Government may award either a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based contract or an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) Agreement.  Accordingly, Offerors are asked to submit proposal responses that accommodate both options.  The Government will evaluate all Offerors’ FAR based proposals (Volumes 1 and 2) in accordance with the established evaluation criteria (see Section 5, Evaluation Criteria for Award, of the PIP), other applicable published procedures (FAR Part 35) and the source selection plan. Interim negotiations may be conducted during this evaluation process.  After award selection based on the FAR based proposals (Volumes 1 and 2), the Government will evaluate the selected awardees Other Transaction proposal (Volume 3) with the intent of selecting a Phase I program approach that offers the more beneficial program approach of the FAR and OTA instrument types considered.  Historically, DARPA has solicited use of Other Transaction Authority exclusively for programs such as this where performance is conducted over multiple phases and it is likely that revolutionary technology accomplishment will benefit both government and industry.  There may be significant advantages for a contractor and/or the Government to want to enter into an OTA agreement if the conditions for an OTA can be met.  OTAs are discussed in more detail in Section 4 of the PIP.  The intent of this evaluation approach is to prevent contractors with greater financial flexibility from reducing the proposed cost to the Government by providing a large cost share or extra effort beyond that of a contractor with less financial capability.  In this approach all proposals are evaluated based upon their technical merits and ability to realistically price their proposed technical scope.  This approach also affords the Offerors and the Government the opportunity to assess, propose and implement the most beneficial approach to program accomplishment.  This approach may also be used in later phases. PROPOSAL PROCEDURES: The Offeror may propose to only one of the two tasks or to both tasks.  However, the Offeror must submit a separate (stand alone) proposal for each task if proposing to more than one task.  In addition, the Offeror may submit only one proposal per task.  The Offeror's proposal should consist of three volumes: Volume 1, FAR Based Technical Proposal; Volume 2, FAR Based Cost Proposal; and Volume 3, OTA Based Delta Proposal.  Volume 3 should represent any difference in technical work and associated cost proposed based on a FAR contract versus the technical work and cost proposed based on an OTA agreement.  If there are no differences, the Offeror should state this in Volume 3 of its proposal.  Volume 3 should also discuss how an OTA would potentially be a better contracting mechanism for both Industry and Government to utilize in Phase I of the FALCON program.  The Offeror should refer to Section 4 of the PIP for guidance on how to structure and organize its proposal.  All Offerors must be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and must provide their CAGE, DUNS and TIN numbers on the cover sheet of the proposal.  One signed original and eight copies of each proposal volume are required for submission.  The Offeror is also required to submit its proposal in electronic format, on CD-ROM, in Microsoft Office 2000 compatible format.  Four CD-ROMs with a copy of each proposal volume are required.  The deadline for receipt of proposals is September 12, 2003, 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.  All proposals should be mailed or hand-carried to the delivery address as follows:  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; Attention:  Mr. James B. Troutman, CMO; FALCON BAA 03-35; 3701 N. Fairfax Drive; Arlington, VA 22203-1714.  Each volume of the proposal shall be packed and sealed separately and clearly marked to identify the volume number.  Responses not received at the address and time specified above will not be considered.  An Offeror intending to include classified information or data as part of its proposal submission should refer to Section 6 of the PIP for instructions.  An Offeror of Task 2 must have or be able to obtain the appropriate United States clearance for Task 2 of the FALCON program. ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All Offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the Offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposed submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Offeror has taken, proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  If the Offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then the Offeror shall so state in the affirmation. NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: The Government intends to use support contractors, plus other independent experts to assist in processing and administering proposals during the Source Selection, and to provide advice relative to selected technical areas.  These personnel are restricted by their contract from disclosing information contained in any proposal for any purpose to anyone outside of the Source Selection for this effort.  Moreover, all personnel used in this capacity are required to enter into separate Organizational Conflict of Interest/Non Disclosure Agreements to this effect.  By submission of its proposal, a team agrees that proposals may be disclosed to these personnel for the purpose of providing this assistance.

<ARCHDATE>11112003
<CONTACT>Rachael  Raposa, 978-318-8249
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be issuing a invitation for Bid for theTown Pond Restoration, Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Town Pond is located in Portsmouth, Rhode Island adjacent to Mount Hope Bay.  The modern historical condition of the Town Pond are a was tidally influenced open water prior to a Corps navigation improvement project placing dredged material in the area in the early 1950s.  At that time, tidal exchange to the interior marsh was effectively halted. The Town Pond Restoration Project calls  for a combination of fifty-percent salt marsh-fifty percent open water/intertidal habitats with on-site disposal of excavated material.  This was selected as the best overall plan for habitat restoration, aesthetic acceptability and affordability.  An est imated 126,000 cubic yards of existing dredged material would be excavated to promote restored tidal exchange to Town Pond.  Over time, the interior marsh will be transformed from a lower value brackish habitat to a high value salt pond and salt marsh habi tat.  The excavation and regrading of the area to reach the new profile will require the establishment of an effective plan for control and diversion of water.  There will be some vegetation removal in the staging and access areas (approximately 1 to 2 acr es of upland vegetation and asphalt at the southeastern end of the site off Anthony Road) on the Roger Williams College property.  The size of disturbance of the staging area, access roads and temporary haul roads will be limited to the minimum necessary f or construction access and a line of erosion control devices will be established along the perimeter.  Temporary haul roads will be removed following their use and these and other areas will be allowed to revegetate following construction.  Areas with seve re slopes or disturbed soils with a high potential to affect water quality will be replanted to limit erosion.  A small area of salt marsh (approximately 80 square feet) will be destroyed to deepen and realign the entrance channel inlet.  Salt marsh plants  will be removed by others prior to construction and planted along the new channel alignment to reestablish a salt marsh cordgrass fringe resulting in no net change in wetland area. Approximately 18 acres of phragmites, which is above the elevation of tida l influence, will be removed to restore salt marsh and estuarine habitat.  Once elevations are established that are flooded by frequent tides estuarine habitats and vegetation communities will establish. There are two concrete structures that will be built  as part of the project.   A 45-foot long, 42-inch diameter culvert with concrete headwalls will replace a smaller old culvert that will be removed and a concrete weir approximately 38 feet long will be built to regulate a permanent pool where the entrance  channel meets the interior marsh.  The plan requires some phragmites wetland filling to construct a water control berm along the west side of the site to prevent flooding of FounderÃ¢Â€Â™s Brook by salt water.  The water control berm would fill approximat ely 3.2 acres of wetland and the public access area would fill approximately 0.35 acre of wetland.  The berm would be seeded with coastal grass and shrubs would be planted at occasional intervals along the top.  Some excavated material would be used to con struct a 6,750 square foot parking area with an entrance off of Anthony Road.  Restoration plan has on-site disposal of excavated material in phragmites wetlands.  The plan would require 7 acres of wetland fill.  The disposal area will be seeded with coast al grasses (e.g. switchgrass) after construction is complete to create a coastal grass community. During the construction phase, there will be provisions to allow continued maintenance access to the existing electric transmission lines that run through the  project area.  THIS SOLICITATION IS UNRESTRICTED.  Solicitation shall be made available via the Internet on or about 8/13/03.  No paper copies of the solicitat ion or amendments will be available. The firms interested must register on the Internet to receive the solicitation.  Registration instructions are available on the Internet at http://www.nae.usace.army.mil as well as the media by which the solicitation wi ll be made available.  Amendments, if any, to this solicitation will be made available at this Internet site.  Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests will be accepted.  Those registering are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the regis tration list.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to issue a Progressive Competition Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP)5-03253-GCC for industry comment.  NASA GSFC, in support to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration requires a contractor to perform the formulation and implementation activities for the Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES) for the upcoming Geosynchronous Operation Environmental Satellite (GOES) R series.  The HES is being developed to provide infrared and visible data collection capabilities for the GOES program series of geo-synchronous satellites to replace the current GOES Series Sounding instrumentation.  HES will provide improved atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles for weather forecasting. The first instrument is expected to fly on GOES-R in 2012 and will be capable of performing multiple tasks in support of environmental sciences.   During this first phase, "Formulation," the Contractor will complete Systems Requirements Analysis, System Trade Studies, Systems Requirements Baseline and Conceptual Design of a HES instrument.  At a minimum, the HES shall be capable of Disk Sounding for temperature and moisture, severe weather/mesoscale sounding for temperature and moisture and shelf and coastal waters images.  The following Trade Studies will be required during the formulation phase:	1) Spectral Detection Instrumentation Methods vs. Wavelength Trade Study; 2) Back-up Imaging Mode Trade Study; 3) Pixel Size Trade Study; 4) Coverage Rate Trade Study; 5) Calibration Methodologies Trade Study; 6) Rapid Local Area Image Update Study; 7) Data Rate Trade Study; 8) Detector Thermodynamic Trade Study; 9) Degraded Instrument Performance Trade Study; 10) Instrument Mechanical and Electrical Properties Trade Study; and any additional trade studies as proposed by the contractor(s).  The Contractor is also expected to perform risk assessments and prepare management plans as well as concept design and cost estimates.  Technical documents have been made available by GSFC at the GOES-R Series Industry Information website	 http://goes2.gsfc.nasa.gov/goesr_industry.htm	 This effort will be a full and open competition and will be acquired in two distinct phases: Phase 1 - Formulation; and Phase 2 - Implementation.  The applicable NAICS is 541330 "Engineering Services." Two or more Phase 1 - Formulation awards are anticipated leading to a single Phase 2 - Implementation award.  A progressive competition strategy will be used with down-selection of sources between phases. The competition for Phase 2 - Implementation will build on the results of Phase 1 - Formulation will include successful completion of Phase 1 requirements.  Accordingly, NASA anticipates that only Phase 1 - Formulation contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase 2. NASA will synopsize the second phase competition in accordance with FAR 5.201 and 5.203, but does not plan to issue a new, formal solicitation.  Instead, proposals will be requested from the initial phase contractors by a letter that will include detailed proposal preparation instructions and evaluation criteria.  Although a new, formal solicitation will not be issued, any responsible source may submit a proposal for Phase 2, and these proposals will be considered by the agency.  Other than the initial phase contractors, all material furnished in Phase 1 will be furnished to prospective offerors for Phase 2. To be considered for Phase 2 award, offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the initial phase contractors, such demonstration to include any initial phase deliverables upon which the second phase award may be based.  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award. This DRFP is for information and planning purposes.  No proposal is requested, and no contract will be awarded as a result of this DRFP.  Potential Offerors are invited to comment on all aspects of the solicitation, including the requirements, proposal instructions, and evaluation approach.  If your comments include recommendations for revisions, you must provide your rationale for such revisions.	NASA anticipates issuance of the DRFP during the month of August 2003 with industry comments due approximately 14 days from the date the DRFP is first made available.  Monitor the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities page Internet site for the release of the DRFP and subsequent RFP.  NASA anticipates issuance of the final RFP approximately 30 days after DRFP comments are received with proposals due 30 days later.   An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities page is	 http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51	 Prospective offerors are requested to notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the draft and final solicitation and amendments (if any). Any referenced numbered notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below. All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or FAX).  Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK.  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice under which the General Services Administration (GSA) is publicizing our intention to contract for the Construction Services for a New U.S. Courthouse in Buffalo, New York based in accordance with GSA’s principals in achieving Construction Excellence.   

GSA intends to contract for complete construction services for a new U.S. Courthouse in Buffalo, NY with general construction contractors (GC) that offer the best overall value to the Government, by: demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, providing and maintaining a viable team organization and adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.  The proposed U.S. Courthouse will be constructed in the Buffalo Downtown Commercial Business District (CBD), and will consist of approximately 24,246 m2 (260,982gsf) including 2,007 m2 (21,600 gsf) for indoor parking.  The building will be occupied by the U.S. District Courts, U.S. Magistrate Courts, District Clerk of Court, U.S. Probation, Circuit Satellite Library, the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Attorney and GSA. The courthouse will provide five district courtrooms, four magistrate courtrooms, related office space, sally port, detention cells, and joint use GSA space, etc.  In addition, fifty-four (54) secured, indoor parking spaces will be provided.  Occupancy is planned for 2007.  The Request For Proposals (RFP) will be issued on or about July 31, 2003. General construction contractors may request a copy of the RFP by submitting a one page letter request to the attention of Enrico Caruso, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration (GSA), Property Development Division, 26 Federal Plaza; New York, NY 10278 or by letter request via fax at (212) 264-0588 or via e-mail to enrico.caruso@gsa.gov.  The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $70,000,000 to $75,000,000. A Pre-Proposal Conference is for Tuesday August 12, 2003, at 10:00 am Local Time at the Thaddeus J. Dulski Federal Building, located at 111 West Huron Street, Buffalo NY 14202. Any questions that offerors may have concerning the price and technical evaluation criteria will be answered.  A Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session is scheduled to immediately follow the Pre-Proposal Conference. Any scope changes by the Government that may result from the pre-proposal conference may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission at no recompense to the offeror(s).  

This procurement is being issued under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and will be open to both large and small business concerns. The NAICS code for this project is 236220 with a size standard of $28.5 million.  The project is in Metric Units of Measure.  The general construction contractor selected will be required to supply all labor, materials, supervision and constructability reviews during the A-E’s Design Phase to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract.  The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than price.  The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire project including the administrative cost of processing RFIs, change orders, etc. throughout the course of this project.

The Government anticipates the award of a Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.2), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the Offeror that provides the best overall value to the Government. The primary objective of this process is to select the most technically qualified contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government when all factors including price are considered.  The entire procurement process will be performed in three (3) Stages, for a point total of 1000.   [The selection of an Offeror will be made at the end of 50% construction documents].  Stage I Submission:  The Government will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Technical and Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) submissions coincident with the end of the A/E Final Design Concept Phase.  

 Stage I:  Small Business Sub-Contracting Experience as a GO-NO GO Factor, subsequently the technical factors for Stage I will be as follows-point total 400: (1) Offeror’s Experience on Similar Projects (125 Points); (2) Offeror’s Past Performance on Similar Projects (125 Points); (3) Qualifications of Key Personnel of the Offeror  (100 Points), and (4) Project Management Plan (50 Points).  The submission of price will be simultaneous with the submission of the technical data but under separate cover and will be based on documents supplied by the A-E design firm relative to the Preliminary Design concepts.  This price should reflect the contractor’s Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for General Contractor Services. Following the evaluation of the technical proposals, a competitive range will be established of Offerors in accordance with FAR Part 15.306-(c).  The Offerors in the competitive range will be involved from the A/E Final Design Concept Phase through the end of the 50% Construction Documents Phase. Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvement measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Stage II and III become the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the drawings and specifications for use under this project at no recompense to the offeror.

Stage II:  During this stage the Offerors in the competitive range will enter into the Participation Phase of the solicitation. The level of effort in this phase includes the following:  Participation in two value engineering workshops lasting two days each, participation in two (2) project meetings, preparation of written comments, performance of one constructability review and preparation of one independent estimate during the Design Development Phase.  Following the completion of this phase, the offerors’ efforts will be evaluated as follows - point total 200:  Stage II Technical Evaluation Factors:  (5) Design Development Participation Phase (200 Points maximum) will consist of the following sub-factors:  (a) Value Engineering Workshop (50 pts.); (b) Written Comments/Ideas (50 pts.); (c) Design Development Constructability Review (50 pts.); (d) Estimate Development (50 pts.).  The Offeror will supply a price that should reflect the offeror’s Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). At the end of Stage II, the Offerors in the competitive range that participate in good faith will be provided a stipend (amount to be determined) for their total effort for the services rendered during this stage.   

Stage III:  During this Stage, the Offerors in the competitive range will enter into the final phase of the solicitation coincident with the A/E 50% Construction Document Phase.  Following completion of this phase the offerors’ efforts will be evaluated as follows- point total 400:  Stage III Technical Evaluation Factors:  (6) 50% Construction Documentation Phase will consist of the following sub-factors: (a) Construction Document Review, where the offerors will become familiar with these documents and provide in writing, additional ideas, recommendations, identify issues or concerns, substantial changes, cost impacts and any other information to assist the offerors as well as GSA, in ensuring that the project scope, schedule, budget are being fully addressed. (150 pts), (b) Construction Document Presentation (150 pts); (c) Detailed Project Management Plan and Technical Approach (100 pts). The offerors in the competitive range will engage in discussions with GSA, this should include a discussion of the offerors’ submission of their management plan and subcontractor information.  After the discussion, the Government will request a revised technical proposal and the contractor’s Firm-Fixed Price Proposal for General Contractor Services.  Also to be included will be a mandatory, proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.705-4 encompassing the following minimum Socio-Economic Program minimum goals: Small Businesses (40%), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (8%), Woman Owned Small Businesses (5%), Hub Zone Small Businesses (3%), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (3%) and Veteran Owned Small Businesses (5%). A failure to submit this plan in conjunction with the Stage III final price proposal, when requested, will render the offer non-responsive.  All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the solicitation number.  Offerors are encouraged to submit their proposals on their most favorable terms and following the combination of the evaluation of technical factors 1-6 with the final price proposal submission, an award will be made to the Offeror (GC) that offers the best value to the Government. 

 After the award of this contract to the selected Offeror (GC), a second stipend (amount to be determined) will be provided to each of the Offerors in the competitive range that participated in a good faith effort for their services rendered during Stage III.  The selected Offeror (GC) will participate in Constructability Services for the 100% and Final Construction Documents Phase. The selected Offeror (GC) will receive a stipend (to be determined) for services during this Stage.  The GSA will subsequently exercise an option for the construction of the project based on the availability of construction funding.

Immediately following the Pre-Proposal Conference that is scheduled during Stage I, the General Services Administration (GSA) will host a Subcontracting Opportunities Networking Session for Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Woman Owned Small Businesses, Hub-Zone Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses and Veteran Owned Small Businesses. The Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA’s recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms, which are considering bidding on this project.  Prospective small business subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with potential prime contractors and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.

St. NW Washington, DC 20240 Description: The Department of the Interior (DOI) has a requirement for Bill  Auditing and Analysis of the Department of Interior Telecommunications  Services.  The primary objective of the  Department of Interior in advancing this shared savings initiative is  to conduct a bill auditing analysis effort as phase one of developing a  unified agency approach to managing telecommunications expenditures.   The effort when complete will result in an independent review of  DOI's  telecommunications services with the intent of identifying charges that  can be reduced or eliminated resulting in future cost avoidance and  cost recovery from applicable credits/refunds from existing service  providers. Further support for this shared savings initiative can be inferred by  some of the provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002 provides agencies  " . . .authority to enter into share-in-savings contracts for  information technology that improves mission related or administrative processes   or accelerates its mission's achievement . . ." Additionally, the  effort will provide a baseline that can facilitate establishing a bill  auditing and analysis function as per Secretarial Order  No. 3244 dated, November 12, 2002.    The overall effort should support the DOI's  objective by facilitating  the achievement  of its goal of developing an efficient, cost  effective, scalable telecommunications invoice processing, and bill audit and  analysis function which will serve the needs of the Department. The Telecommunications programs and systems at the DOI include a wide  range of technologies from basic telephone service to land mobile radio  information systems.  However, the focus of this effort will be on  those requirements, which lend themselves to telephony and network-based  solutions. The effort will require the contractor to capture, review, and audit  the DOI's existing telecommunications services and expenditures.  These  services include but are not limited to; voice services, wireless  communications, Internet  service providers, local access arrangements, video  teleconferencing,  wide area network services, point-to-point circuits,  etc.  Some of the vendors that support the Department's base of  services include but are not limited to, long distance and network carriers  such as WorldCom, Sprint, AT&T; local exchange carriers such as Quest,  Pacific Bell, Southwestern Bell, Citizens, Verizon; wireless carriers  such as AT&T Wireless, Nextel, Verizon; and satellite providers such as  Hughes Network Systems. At a minimum, the Department of Interior expects to achieve the  following objectives  as part of this shared savings initiative: Identification of all service providers, services, contracts and/or  service  agreements in order to establish an electronic baseline profile  (inventory) that captures the Department's base of service providers,  services, acquisition and payment methods for services; and  ·	Agency wide audit and review of telecommunications services, by  service provider, that results in the identification and actual  crediting/refund related to overpayments, erroneous and/or misapplied charges,  associated with:  services/equipment that are not being used, inter-carrier  billing, double billing, inaccurate/misapplied taxes and surcharges,  carrier access fees, universal ·	service fees, inaccurate mileage codes on circuits, incorrectly  applied tariff  ·	rates and structure, etc.  The Department of Interior's goal is to  realize credits and/or savings in the 1st  quarter of FY2004; and Identification and strategy of those services that may achieve cost  savings based on reengineering or optimization, and identifying services  that due to volume may qualify for discounts when bundled under a single  service provider or contract.   It is DOI's intent to award a one year Small Business Set Aside  contract under NAICS code 541511 in fiscal year 2004, on a negotiated  competitive basis. The solicitation will be available on or about  8/11/03. The  closing date for receipt of offers will be addressed therein.  Interested parties shall obtain a copy of the solicitation by accessing the  following webpage: www.fedbizopps.gov. This process will be completed in an  electronic media only through this fedbizopps publication.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), (DHHS) through the Program Support Center has a twelve  (12) month simplified acqusition procurement described as follows: 
The Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program is a formula grant program that provides funds to each of the 56 States/Territories to provide mental health and support services to persons who are homeless and have serious mental illnesses.  PATH funds are distributed to States/Territories that, in turn, contract with local public or not-for-profit organizations to fund a variety of eligible services.  State mental health agencies administer PATH funds and assure compliance with Federal reporting requirements and the statute.  State/Territories are required to submit an annual report, which describes the utilization of funds, services offered by local providers and characteristics of clients.

The PATH Program is administered by the Homeless Programs Branch (HPB) in the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS).  The Branch monitors State and local activities through review of the annual reports and a limited number of site visits.  The PATH program experiences high annual turnover in State PATH Contacts, the mental health agency staff who coordinate the State PATH program.  This degree of change in State PATH Contacts and, to some extent, PATH-funded providers, increases the importance of a periodic field review of the program.  Further, limited travel funds restrict the number of federal monitoring visits conducted by Branch staff.

All firms interested in being considered for this potential acquisition shall submit a written request for a copy of the solicitation to the above address by 3:00 PM  EST August 13, 2003. 
E-mail and fax are accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), plans on entering into a sole source contract with the Karolinska Institute, Department of Medical Epidemiology, S-171 77, Stockholm, Sweden for professional services to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting a minimum of 80 esophageal adenocarcinoma cases and 240 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases in prospective cohort studies with blood collection at baseline and data on confounding factors, and review of medical records for confirmation of diagnosis.  Epidemiologists at the Karolinska Institute are among the world's leading researchers of the environmental and genetic determinants of esophageal and gastric cancers.  Their nationwide case-control study of esophageal cancer has not only confirmed earlier findings of risks in relation to Helicobacter pylori infection by NCI investigators, but has provided evidence for alternative mechanisms for these risks.  NCI is interested in conducting cohort studies to follow-up these findings and to test alternative hypotheses regarding esophageal cancer risks.  Karolinska Institue has access to data and serum samples in several cohort studies in the Nordic countries that are part of a consortium of biological specimen banks for studies of cancer causes and control, and have secured access for data and sera for esophageal cancer cases and matched controls that would allow evaluation of the H. pylori-related risks.  The number of cases identified, the amount of serum per subject, and the quality of data from this consortium would meet the NCI's requirements.  There is no ohter organization known to the NCI that can provide the required services/data.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the required services/information, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT on August 13, 2003. This acquisition will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13 to use simplified acquisition procedures.  The NAICS Code 541990.

NOTE: The furnished electronic files do not contain varnish masks, or traps and the contractor shall create these items as part of their production.  Heavy coverage is required and the contractor must take all necessary precautions to prevent ghosting and lay a smooth, uniform ink film.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Joint Program Office (MJPO) intends to acquire continuing MILSATCOM space communications support tools maintenance and upgrades, and related general systems engineering support, for the secure/survivable Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), Milstar, and Transformational Communications programs.  Contracted effort shall provide systems engineering support for the AEHF program including AEHF training, International Partner coordination, cryptographic key management and security changes, evaluating requirements changes, verification and system test support, cryptographic key management for test assets, and coordination of the test program.  Milstar general systems engineering support will be required to ensure AEHF backward compatibility with the Milstar constellation.  This support includes military unique communication system issue identification and resolution, LDR/MDR communications performance support, operational use support, impact of system changes on software tools, system impact of terminal designs, direct technical support to MJPO technical management, strategic voice operation support, and strategic network transition support.  Extensive and pre-existing experience, knowledge, and background dealing with DoD specific capabilities in the EHF secure satellite communications field and a minimum Government security clearance of Secret are mandatory. Contracted effort shall maintain and upgrade the AEHF End-to-End Simulation Environment (AEHF MEESE).  The AEHF MEESE is a unique multi-processor based PC platform tool developed by Titan Systems Corp for EHF waveforms testing, that provides the complete AEHF end-to-end link emulation via the development and integration of various sub-system models for the payload and terminals.  The contractor shall update AEHF MEESE software, firmware and hardware to emulate AEHF payload and terminal designs.  The contracted effort shall add new functionality required to perform system-level analyses supporting systems engineering activities, such as overall system performance evaluations, design trade-off studies, system anomaly resolution and impact assessment studies, to ensure military war fighters receive secure survivable communications. Contracted effort shall provide engineering support to the Milstar Satellite Operations Center (MSOC).  This effort will support the day-to-day staff operations of the MSOC using a unique communications management tool developed by Titan Systems Corp to manage military EHF resources, providing support to all armed services.  This support will require in depth knowledge of the communications management tool (MCPT-i), EHF systems, and military communications schedules and procedures.  This support will include the following Milstar related activities: communications requirements generation, Milstar Apportionment Report (MAR) development, review and analysis, communications requirements loading analysis, payload table generation management/review, testing support, providing technical advice and instruction on a as-needed basis to MSOC personnel, Milstar training, and COMSEC/TRANSEC management, and all mobile deployed locations. Contracted effort shall include support for the Transformational Communications (TC) program's waveform and protocol development. The AEHF, Milstar, and TC program effort is a follow-on to the MILSATCOM support contract currently being performed by Titan Systems Corp–Communications & Software Solutions Division, Los Angeles, CA.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is Aug 2003. It is anticipated that only the incumbent tools developer has sufficient relevant experience to meet the requirements of this acquisition.  This notice is primarily intended for subcontracting opportunities.  However, interested parties must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 11 Aug 03, demonstrating knowledge of AEHF and Milstar satellites and ground systems and EHF waveform and protocol development.  The SOC shall not exceed 10 pages in length. The contractor must possess or be able to obtain necessary security clearances. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute a RFP. The Government will not recognize any direct costs associated with submission of a SOC. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the type of procurement. Submit all responses to: SMC/MCKM, Attn: Charles Briggs, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467 A-8, Los Angeles AFB, CA 90245-4659.  The period of performance is for 1 year from 1 Oct 03 to 30 Sep 04. The Government’s ROM estimate for this work is approximately $6.5M.  Government-wide numbered notes 22 and 26 apply. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman for the Space and Missiles Systems Center is Dr. David Ganger at (310) 363-0588.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and performing  all labor required to complete the replacement of the fan coil units,  heating/cooling water system, windows, and roof in Facilities 10834, 10835, and  10836.

The estimated price range is  between $1M and $5M.  The NAICS Code is 238220.  The size standard is $12M.   This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement in accordance with the Small Business  Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15  U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations issued  after 31 May 1998.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov, or  telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423.  Every solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must  include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, "Required Central Contractor  Registration.: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: This project involves  the Visitor Quarters (VQ), which houses military and  civilian personnel of all levels, including VIPs on  Temporary Duty at WPAFB for numerous official Air Force  activities.  This project is in an extremely high  visibility area, due to the number of visiting individuals  housed at any one time, and will receive an unusually high  level of scrutiny.  This project will be subject to a very  tight construction schedule.  The project is in phases, and  involves work in each room.  This work will require close  coordination between disciplines, and close supervision by  the contractor in order to minimize the number of  unavailable rooms at any one time.  The work must be  accomplished so that the remaining occupied units will not  be impacted, nor the personnel housed in them  inconvenienced.  The requirement to supervise and  coordinate the work in all of the rooms contained in the  VQ will present the contractor with a difficult  construction management challenge.  Failure to supervise  and coordinate the different trades required to provide a  quality and timely product will not be acceptable.   Performance is critical to minimize disruption to WPAFB  activities.  The liquidated damages associated with not  meeting the contractual period of performance will be high  due to the cost of housing Air Force personnel off base if  the rooms are not available on schedule. NOTES: (1) The solicitation, specifications, and drawings will be available on the  website on or about 14 July 03, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. (2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you may  download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation. (4) A hard copy of the solicitation will be available for review at Dayton  Builders Exchange, Minority Contractor Business Assistance Program, and F.W.  Dodge Division in Dayton, OH. (5) A registration page will be attached to the website.  You are not required  to register.  Howeverm when you register you will receive notice of any  amendments and/or addendums that may be issued to the solicitation.  If you  have not registered, it will be your responsibility to check the website for  any changes to the solicitation. (6) Contractors shall be capable of securing bonding for the total proposed  amount (base plus options).  However, contractors shall only be responsible for  providing bonding for the base amount plus the amount of any/all options  exercised at the time of award.  If an option is exercised after award,  contractors shall be responsible for securing the additional bonding equal to  the amount of the option. (7) You shall provide a signed copy of the SF 1442 by the proposal closing date  specified in the solicitation.  There will not be a public bid opening. (8) Contractors that are Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment are  excluded from receiving contracts.  Agencies also shall not consent to  subcontract with such contractors.  Proposals prepared by Debarred, Suspended,  or otherwise ineligible contractors are at the risk and expense of the  contractor.

<SUBJECT>70 -- HUBZone Small Business Set Aside for Cisco Equipment
<SOLNBR>SB1341-03-Q-0718
<RESPDATE>081203
<ARCHDATE>08272003
<CONTACT>Joseph Widdup, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 975-6324, Fax (301) 975-8884, Email joseph.widdup@nist.gov
<DESC>This solicitation is hereby cancelled, since NIST just obtained information from SBA that this procurement cannot be conducted as a HUBZone small business set aside.  Explanation: Almost a year ago, SBA issued draft regs that will clarify some of the ambiguities of the language in their regulations, but will also clarify the restrictive nature of the program.  Hubzone small businesses only may be joined (either as a contractor/sub or
teaming arrangement) with another Hubzone small business.   And, the mentor-protgete program does not apply to the Hubzone program; only to 8(a).  Similarly, the class waiver to the nonmanufacturer rule for routers and switches upon which we were relying does not apply to Hubzone acquisitions.  The only exceptions for the nonmanufacturer rule in Hubzone acquisitions are for buys under $25,000.  (This procurement would have been valued at a much higher dollar amount than that.)  In short, the definitions for non-manufacturer in 13 CFR for Hubzone small businesses refer one to the definition set out in the 8(a) regulations; but only to 2 of the 3 prongs.  The applicable sections of the definition do not include the class waiver provision.   This is reflected in FAR 52.219-3(e), which
clearly provides that a Hubzone small business non-manufacturer must furnish end products from another Hubzone small business.  In summary, this solicitation is cancelled and will not be procured using any other open market method, including through the 8(a) program.  It cannot be procured through the 8(a) program because one of the restrictions in going through the 8(a) program is that the procurement has not been previously advertised as a small business set aside or as a HUBZone small business set aside.  The Government has determined that it will satisfy the requirements of this procurement through an existing Government contract program.

<DESC>Notice of Intent.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Type Contract for the procurement of AN/FPN-64 Transmitter Controller Systems for a period of (5) five years to Megapulse, Inc., 101 Billerica Ave., 4 Billerica Business Center, N. Billerica, MA  01862.  The United States Coast Guard is the world’s pioneer and specialist in the Long Range Navigation (LORAN) System.  The responsibility for LORAN operations was transferred from the Department of Defense to the Coast Guard in 1974.  The Coast Guard operates and maintains the U.S. LORAN System to meet the needs of air, land, and marine navigators, as well as precise time and time interval users.  The 1999 Federal Radionavigation Plan (FRP) announced that the government would continue to operate LORAN in the short term, while the administration evaluates the long-term need.  To ensure continued operability, to gain efficiencies of operation and support, and to improve the technical capabilities of the LORAN system, the Coast Guard is considering the initiation of a contract for a minimum quantity of 2 and a maximum quantity of 17 AN/FPN-64 Transmitter Controller Systems, manufactured by Megapulse, Inc., N. Billerica, MA.  01862.  The purpose of this market survey announcement is to solicit interest from industry that offers a commercial model to meet the requirement to replace the existing 1970’s vintage SSX Transmitter Operational Controllers (TOPCO).  No specifications, schematics or drawings are available due to limited rights of technical data.  The new Transmitter Controller System must be a fit, form and functional replacement for the existing TOPCO, with additional functionalities, such as complete remote control capability, autonomous transmitter operation, autonomous control of redundant functionalities, transmitted signal analysis and report capability, and full event, alarm and fault logging capability.  Due to critical, safety of life and property, nature of Loran-C transmissions, installation work that interrupts those transmissions must be accomplished efficiently, under strict pre-arranged schedule and time constraints.  Under this request for information, all responsible sources are encouraged to submit a capability statement that sufficiently demonstrates qualifications, capabilities, facilities, and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement, in total, or in part.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal.  There will not be a contract award as a result of this request for information.  Responses to this announcement should be submitted, in writing, not later than 08AUG03 to the attention of Mrs. Catherine Baskin at the address stated above.

<DESC>GOVERNMENT SOURCES SOUGHT / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NSSWCDD / CSS is seeking sources for  an underwater acoustic transmitting and receiving system to be used with the AN/SLQ-48 Mine Neutralization System (MNS). Preferably the system would be commercial off the shelf.  The general background regarding usage and desired features of the system are as follows: The MNS delivers a destructor (bomb) to neutralize threat underwater mines.  For exercise and training (E&T) versions of this destructor, a simulated detonation signal is sought.  The signal will be received by the surface ship operating the MNS, confirming a successful simulated detonation of the destructor.    · The destructor would be modified by attaching a tethered acoustic transmitter.  This transmitter would receive a “FIRE” signal produced by the destructor, transmitted through  the tether/electrical cable.  Upon receipt of the FIRE signal, the acoustic transmitter would produce an acoustic signal. This acoustic signal would be received by the controlling surface ship at ranges up to 1000 yards.  · The tether/electrical cable is expected to be less than three feet long.  A longer tether would interfere with operation with the underwater delivery vehicle.  The tether and a floatation device will likely be necessary to optimize acoustic performance by allowing the transmitter to float above the destructor on the sea floor.  Tether/electrical cable rigidity would be dependant on the weight and size (hydrodynamic drag) of the transmitter. ·  The transmitter will be required to withstand the forces of desctuctor delivery (dropping from a height of up to 30 feet above the sea floor). ·  The maximum operating depth of the E&T destructor will be 300 feet. ·  Due to interference from shipboard acoustic sources and the characteristics of the shipboard transducer, the expected operating frequency of the transmitting and receiving systems would be 25-30 kHz. · The cost of compliance with the Navy’s safety certification requirements for lithium battery powered devices, S9310-AQ-SAF-010, July 1988, will likely preclude use of lithium batteries in the transmitter.  However, if a potential system supplier has received Navy approval for the use of a proposed lithium battery transmitter, eliminating the need for further certification testing, a lithium battery powered transmitter will be considered. · The destructor contains a 25 volt (approximate) battery.   Although a self-powered transmitter is preferable, a transmitter powered by the destructor’s battery would be considered if significant transmitter weight and size reductions woul d be achieved. · The surface ships are equipped with “D/26” transducers (transmit and receive) produced by Neptune Sonar, Ltd. (www.neptune-sonar.co.uk) described in the attached data sheet (NeptuneD26.pdf).  This file can be accessed in the N61331-03-Q-JM05 file through the Sources Sought table at  http://www.ncsc.navy.mil/contracts/ZTables/soltab.htm Additional shipboard cable adds 6-7 nF of capacitance.  It is expected that this transducer will provide the most cost efficient means of receiving the signal aboard the surface platform.  The transducer is connected to a junction box in the surface ships’ combat information center (CIC) by shielded cable of approximately 14AWG wire, allowing high voltage transmission (e.g. for handshaking signals between the shipboard receiver and transmitter). Descriptive information is sought in the form of brochures, specification sheets  and company points of contact. It is highly desirable that firms be ISO 9001 certified in the manufacture of equipments used in the types of applications of interest specified herein. Design proposals requiring developmental funding are not of interest at this time; this RFI may not directly lead to a request for proposals. Deadline for submission is 30 August 2003.   Additional information about U.S. Navy surface and other mine countermeasures systems pertinent to this RFI can be obtained by accessing: www.ncsc.navy.mil.  Information should be submitted to the attention of: (in hard copy only) Mr. John Miller, Contract Specialist, Code XPS1, Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (NSWCDD CSS), 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City FL 32407. Technical Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to Mr. Philip Davis, e-mail DavisPC@ncsc.n avy.mil.

<SUBJECT>F -- Numerical well-test analysis code for analysis of transient pressure and flow-rate data
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories has developed a numerical well-test analysis code, nSIGHTS, which analyzes transient pressure and flow-rate data to estimate hydraulic parameters of interest, such as transmissivity, storativity, flow geometry, etc.   It also allows for sophisticated statistical evaluation of uncertainty in the parameter estimates, a process aided by extensive graphics capabilities . It is based on numerical methods in turn based on graph theory for transient pressure calculations, allowing simulation/analysis of tests performed under non-ideal conditions. Simulation capabilities include flow and pressure responses in complex systems with variable hydraulic parameters and/or flow geometry, temperature effects, borehole closure, variable wellbore storage, complex pressure histories, and variable pumping rates.It can be run on a PC with a Windows operating system. Areas of practical application include water resource evaluation, groundwater remediation, groundwater development, and oil and gas exploration and production.  
 
Sandia is seeking partnerships with industry as well as universities to commercialize this technology and/or further develop its use in the educational field as a training tool.  For further information, please respond by mail or fax (No phone calls, please) to Alane Dulski within 2 weeks at :  Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Workshop entitled
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to award on a sole source basis under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with the Tennessee State University, Center for Health Research, 3500 John A. Merritt Blvd., Nashville, Tennessee 37209, to present a workshop entitled “Grant Writing Workshop for Historically Black Colleges and Universities Investigators (HBCUs) Mid-Atlantic and Southern Regions – Tennessee State University.  This workshop is a partnership between the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Tennessee State University (TSU), Center for Health Research. The aim of the proposed grants writing workshop is to increase the number of well-trained competitive researchers from HBCUs.  The objectives of this workshop are to: 1) select and train 55 HBCU faculty members on how to write health services research grants, 2) increase the number of HBCU researchers applying for health services research grants, 3) increase the success rate of participants who apply for a health services grant award, 4) increase the number of well trained competitive HBCU researchers, 5) develop an HBCU network of cross-institutional collaborators in health services research, 6) examine successful grants that have been written to learn more about the mechanics of writing a fundable grant proposal, and 7) provide HBCU researchers with the tools and skills needed to prepare and submit competitive research grants.  HBCU researchers from the MID Atlantic and Southern Regions will attend the workshop.  The workshop is planned to be held in 2004.  This will be a two-day workshop covering all aspects of a fundable grant proposal.  Prior to the workshop, HBCU researchers invited to the workshop will be required to submit a concept paper (not exceeding 2 pages) pertaining to an idea that can be fully developed as a grant proposal.  The concept paper will include major components of a proposal such as purpose and specific aims, hypothesis, pilot work (if any), methodology and sampling, and proposed statistical analyses.  The workshop faculty will carefully review the papers.  A major factor for the sole source justification is that this HBCU is addressing an area that CMS is concern about.  TSU is a comprehensive, urban, coeducational land-grant university founded in 1912. The 450-acre main campus, with more than 65 buildings, is located in a residential setting; the Avon Williams Campus is located downtown, near the center of the Nashville business and government district.  The University serves an enrollment of 9,000 students.  TSU offers 42 baccalaureate degrees and 21 master's degrees, as well as the two-year Associate of Science degree in nursing and dental hygiene, and doctoral degrees in public administration, administration and supervision, curriculum and instruction and psychology.  The University is centrally located, easily accessible by car and direct airline flights.  It is close to several HBCUs in nearby states.  The workshop will be coordinated in collaboration with staff from the Center for Health Research.  The Center was established at TSU by Dr. Baqar Husaini, a member of The Network, in 1976.  It is a free-standing research center, funded exclusively by external grants from federal agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Centers for Disease Control.  A multi-disciplinary team of researchers at TSU and other universities work with the Center through various research projects and collaborative arrangements.  The Center continues to develop a long-standing and active relationship with the local minority community in addressing its health-related needs.  If there are no affirmative written responses received within (45) calendar days from the published date of this notice, a purchase order shall be awarded.

In 1999, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board granted approval for the School of Public Health and a doctoral program in public health (Dr.P.H.).  The School of Public Health consists of five departments: Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Environmental and Occupational Health, and Health Management and Policy.  The Dean directs the School of Public Health, with the assistance of the Associate Dean for Administration and Community Health and the five Department Chairs.   The faculty complement involved in teaching, research and service for 2001/2002 is 29.0 FTE.  In addition, the School of Public Health has established the Institute for Public Health Research (IPHR) to address the health and health care needs of the local, state and global health community through applied research, communication, and professional and community training.  It also provides specialized training, consulting, research and technical assistance to organizations and agencies that practice health care and public health.   The goal of the IPHR is to develop public health-related solutions for communities through academic-community partnerships with health departments, community organizations, health care delivery organizations, other health-related organizations and academic units within universities.   If there are no affirmative written responses received within (45) calendar days from the published date of this notice, a purchase order shall be awarded.

<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center Aging Aircraft Division, ASC/AAA, WPAFB, OH, will host an Extended 1553B Databus Performance Workshop, 0830-1600, Tuesday,  23 September 2003.   All attendees must present government issued photo  identification during the required onsite registration process, scheduled for  0730-0820.  The scheduled workshop will be held at the Hope Hotel and  Conference Center (http://www.hopehotel.com/frame.htm ), Super-Flying/Main  Ballroom, Area A, WPAFB, OH.  Personnel planning to attend must complete  registration requirements (government/military or nongovernment) identified at  the supporting Pre-Award Information Exchange System (PIXS) website  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/EB1553/EB1553.asp.   To remain fully  informed, personnel can register for automated updates on any new information,  relevant to this topic, posted at the subject site. Please review the Extended 1553B Databus Performance Workshop Security file,  posted at the supporting PIXS webpage, if you plan to attend this event.    Individuals failing to comply with personal identification requirements (all  attendees) and/or the DD Form 2345 certification requirements (nongovernment  attendees) will not be admitted into the workshop—no exceptions.  The planned event will 1) showcase Air Force investment activity aimed at  enhancing 1553B throughput performance, 2) highlight the results from two  independent 1553B assessments, 3) provide a forum to discuss anticipated  databus bandwidth requirements and options for meeting expanded throughput  across existing 1553B cable plants and 4) introduce Air Force business and  technical strategies for assessing and validating expanded (high-bandwidth)  1553B performance across existing cable as flight capable.  A detailed agenda  is posted at the indicated PIXS website.  Under an Air Force Dual Use Science and Technology (DUST) Program award,  ASC/AAA has teamed with ASC/ENA, AFRL/IFTA and HECV and the Ogden Air Logistics  Center F-16 System Program Office to accelerate demonstrating high bandwidth  1553B performance capabilities, using existing 1553B cable plants.  The shift  to netcentric warfare, achieved through information dominance, demands the  existing force structure has the required avionics databus bandwidth headroom  to affordably accommodate quick reaction capability growth.  Avionics  advancements continue to enable leading edge platforms to be readily equipped  with combat superior capabilities; however, incurred bandwidth constraints can  no longer be affordably mitigated through additional cable plant insertions.   Alternative transmission options for legacy aircraft are not attractive to the  Air Force because of the incurred wiring modification and/or  test/recertification burden.    Extended (high-bandwidth) 1553B data bus performance will be demonstrated and  the business plan for deploying the enabling Xi Channel technology will be  discussed by Edgewater Computer Systems, Inc., http://www.edgewater.ca/.  One- on-one technical interchange, held in conjunction with the subject workshop,  with Edgewater Computer Systems can be requested by contacting the company  through their website.  Substantive discussion with Edgewater requires formal  concurrence with their Proprietary Information Agreement (PIA), demanding  responsive action to ensure adequate cycle time for PIA review and coordination  (approximately 30 days).   The above Air Force team encourages broad industry representation and is  looking forward to vigorous interchange and discussion.  Lead avionics  engineers from the major ASC system program offices will be in attendance.   Invitations will be extended to relevant avionics representatives from the  other services. Please direct all inquiries via e-mail to Lt. Daniel Noel, using  daniel.noel@wpafb.af.mil.

Take note of the following stipulations:

PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER—CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (MAY 1999)
 
(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
 
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--
 
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
 
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
 
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.
 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
 
(e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database.
 
(f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
 
(i) Making a correct payment;
 
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
 
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
 
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
 
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
 
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
 
(g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
 
(h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
 
(i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.
 
(j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.
 
(End)

F.O.B. DESTINATION (Nov 1991)

(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, Subpart 13.106 and Subpart 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  This is a full and open competition.  Description of Work to be performed: In December 1999, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) published a Rule establishing a set of eligibility requirements for appraisers seeking placement on the FHA Roster.  The regulation stipulated that, in order to be placed on the FHA Roster of Appraisers, appraisers must be licensed or certified in the state in which they operate and a pass a HUD/FHA examination on appraisal methods and reporting.  Only appraisers listed on the Roster are permitted to provide appraisal services for properties secured by FHA-insured mortgages.  As part of FHA requirements, Single Family Program Development (SFPD) has established and developed (2) examinations.   A national provider will administer the exams and the cost paid by the user. The following are the tests to be administered: 1.) FHA Appraiser Examination certifies appraisers' knowledge of HUD Handbook 4150.2 Valuation Analysis for Home Mortgage Insurance.  This examination is mandatory for placement on the FHA Roster of HUD-approved appraisers; and 2.) The Federal Housing Administration seeks to improve its certification process through a comprehensive examination "Qualifying Examination for 203 (K) Consultants" that will provide an objective measure of the 203 (K) consultant's knowledge and competence.  Passing the examination with a satisfactory score must be achieved before the 203 (K) consultant can receive HUD approval and provide services in that capacity. SFPD has developed examination questions and examination standards for the FHA exams.  HUD/SFPD is soliciting testing companies with the capability to administer the FHA Exams on a national level.  The total cost of the testing fee is to be paid by the examination applicants.  The testing/examination fee to the applicant and capabilities of each provider will be considered in choosing an individual company or companies to administer FHA Exams.  HUD/FHA will deliver examinations to the Contractor and the Contractor shall administer the examinations. The examination format is multiple-choice questions.  HUD must be able to change FHA Exam questions at any time, with a reasonable amount of notice from HUD to the Contractor.  Broad revisions are expected annually.  The Contractor shall be required to submit/transmit the examination results electronically to SFPD on a daily basis.  FHA Exam candidates must be afforded the opportunity to obtain additional copies of Official Score Reports (examination results) for a nominal fee to be determined by the National Test Administrator.  The Contractor shall be able to provide examination results to examinees at conclusion of examination.  The Contractor is not required to incur any unnecessary expense for advertising.  The contractor will provide a list of the test sites, locations, and testing times.  HUD will make this information available, via the HUD web, to any/all persons interested in taking the test.  SFPD is seeking a vendor to be a National Test Administrator (NTA).  The NTA will administer examinations provided by SFPD to applicants.  The primary objective is to provide an appraisal certification examination to appraisers in the fifty (50) States and Territories of the United States.

All fee rates to be charged will remain in effect for each one-year period (from date of contract award for 12 months for base year and each of two one year options).  The estimated number of applicants to be tested annually is between 1000 and 4000.  The FHA Exams are mandatory and the preceding information is based upon data currently available to HUD, which HUD deems reliable.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items (JAN 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are included in the relative order of importance: (1) The Contractor must submit an explanation of the proposed technical approach in conjunction with the tasks outlined in the scope of work.  The detailed work plan must indicate how each aspect of the scope of work will be accomplished (e.g., documented referral for hospital care of the normal obstetrical patient as well as for the woman who develops complications during pregnancy, labor and/or delivery) as well as your facility’s experience with the coordination and provision of prenatal services, and your experience with IHS functions.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.  (b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  The following FAR and Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) clauses are applicable: 52.204-4, 52.204-6, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.217-8, 52.217-9, 52.223-5, 52.223-6, 52.224-1, 52.224-2, 52.229-3, 52.232-18, 52.237-2, 52.237-3, 52.237-7, 52.242-15, 52.242-17, 52.245-1, 52.245-2, 352.202-1, 352.223-70, 352.232-9, 352.270-2, 352.270-3, 352.270-4, 352.270-6, and 352.270-7.
