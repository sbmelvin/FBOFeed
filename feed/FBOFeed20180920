These supplies are required to continue hemorrhagic shock studies on swine in order to examine the use and outcomes with REBOA as a component to augment treatment.
<p>The Emergency Room-Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion (ER-REBOA) catheters are the only occlusion balloon catheters on the market capable of being inserted into a vessel via a minimally invasive procedure and fully occluding a vessel. A search of the FDA website determined that Prytime Medical developed the ER-REBOA catheters and has the proprietary knowledge to manufacture the technology. Therefore, Prytime Medical is the only manufacturer that can provide ER-REBOA catheters and catheter convenience kits. Combat Medical Systems, LLC is the sole, authorized distributor of the ER-REBOA catheters and catheter convenience kits, for Prytime Medical, to the DoD and Federal Law Enforcement agencies throughout the United States.
