<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive. Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award. Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 855-3556. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<br />Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.<br />21. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Louis Colon, 405-855-3534, louis.colon.2@us.af.mil.</p>

STATEMENT OF TASK/SCOPE OF WORK
GENERAL SCOPE OF WORK:  

IMPORTANT: The Architect/Engineer (A/E) WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE and LIABLE for the professional engineering, architectural and technical accuracy and coordination of the construction contract documents among the various engineering/architectural disciplines, a detailed cost estimate, and other services and documentation furnished under this contract.

NOTE:  The Department of Veterans Affairs (hereinafter the  VA ) WILL NOT be responsible and accountable for performing engineering/architectural design services.

The A/E consultant shall provide services of professional architects and engineers to accomplish the scope of work described herein.  The prime consultant shall be an architectural firm licensed to provide professional architectural services.  The prime consultant shall have documented direct experience on at least 3 healthcare projects similar in scope and complexity within the past 5 years.  Services shall include providing comprehensive architectural and engineering services to produce complete contract construction drawings and specifications that are appropriate for competitive bidding in an open market environment.  The consultant shall also provide thorough site investigation services to document existing conditions, space and equipment planning services, technical reports, cost estimates, construction administration services and other related professional services as noted.  

Scope of Work: 

The purpose of this project is to address critical patient and staff safety issues with the correction of identified failing window facility conditions within the main VA Health Care System Building 1.  Project will correct specific identified failing FCA issues for broken and failed window seals, deteriorated window gaskets, leaking and fogging windows, window peeling issues, failed glazing, cracked and broken glass, poor condition windows and window systems, broken window hardware, and windows at the end or beyond their useful life.  All windows in the 12-story nursing tower are original to the 1966-era building and do not comply with modern hospital standards.  Project will ensure improved patient, staff, and visitor safety to the VA Health Care System as well as correct failing infrastructure while realizing Health Care System energy cost savings.  The location of this project is in Building 1, floors 1-12.  Functions included in the project directly include safety, maintenance, and energy, however all aspects of staff and patient care will be impacted by the improvement of windows to modern hospital standards.  The project will greatly impact numerous areas of the VA Health Care System by correcting needed facility condition deficiencies and significant window safety issues, upgrading current 1966 windows to modern Health Care System requirements, and recapturing lost energy cost savings.   This project shall be designed in accordance with VA specifications, design guides, design manual   particularly the VA-CFM TIL Design Manual, and all applicable codes and regulations, latest editions [Important: During the entire design process, all codes which are incorporated in the design of this project that are updated, the A/E shall issue addenda identifying all code-revisions which will impact the design of the project prior to the VA releasing the construction contract documents for procurement of construction services (i.e.: bid process)].  

The project shall also correct the following FCA deficiencies:

  FCA Record Number: 201859, Building Number: 1A, System: Architectural, Subsystem: Windows, Condition: D, Correction Cost: $14,268 , Description: 1st floor Canteen: The sunroom glazing system has leaking seals and the glass is fogged. The original sunroom was installed on the building in 1995. 20-25 LF of vinyl base at the windows is peeling below the glazing. 

  FCA Record Number: 122865, Building Number: 1C, System: Architectural, Subsystem: Windows, Condition: D, Correction Cost: $811,139, Description: -The windows throughout building 1C have broken seals and hardware. Replace the double pane, pivot, integrated blind windows with double pane, energy efficient, low e glass windows. The Geriatric windows are fogging. Replace 250-300 windows.
Additionally, the Atlanta VAMC is also a Federal Coordinating Center (FCC) and a Primary Receiving Center (PRC), so upgrading needed windows for blast protection better serves the community in times of national emergencies and natural disasters. By installing new windows with blast protection at the lower levels, the Medical Center will also meet the requirements and guidelines outlined in the VA Physical Security Design Manual. 

Further, the existing windows are not energy efficient. Advances in technology have significantly increased the insulating capabilities of windows; therefore, significant energy savings will be realized as a result of this investment.  It also contributes to the Department's energy goals by reducing the BTU/SF by providing new, energy efficient windows that will significantly reduce the energy usage and costs associated with heating and cooling of the building.  Lastly, this investment also serves to meet the Atlanta VAMC strategic goal of Improving Customer Service by incorporating healing, holistic concepts, such as functioning, safe, and useable windows, into the medical center's infrastructure.

This project shall be designed to achieve an energy consumption level that is at least 30% below the level achieved under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004, if life-cycle cost effective.  Use Appendix G of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 to document the energy savings.  Should the 30% reduction in energy consumption prove not to be life-cycle cost effective, then the A/E shall evaluate alternative designs at 5% successive decrements in order to identify the most energy-efficient design that is life-cycle cost effective. Should the 30% reduction in energy consumption prove not to be life-cycle cost effective, then the A/E shall evaluate alternative designs at 5% successive decrements in order to identify the most energy-efficient design that is life-cycle cost effective. The following parameters shall be used for performing the analysis:

20 year life-cycle period for system comparison
Use Public domain programs such as TRACE, E-CUBE, Carrier E20-II, EnergyPlus, etc.
3% Discount Factor
Do not include taxes or insurance while computing costs.

As construction costs for the Atlanta-GA area and in particular the Atlanta VAMC are substantially different from other areas. The A/E is required to confirm estimates for each discipline with appropriate databases, manufacturers  information, general- and subcontractors contractors, to insure accuracy.  Also, as the various factors involved in the construction estimating can change rapidly, it is required that the A/E develops the estimate using Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that can easily accommodate these changes.  The cost estimates shall be grouped utilizing the CSI Master Format 2016.  The cost estimate shall be quantitative, descriptive, detailed, and include facets of work and costs required to complete construction.  The cost estimate shall include both Government Furnished Equipment and Contractor Furnished Equipment.  The cost estimates shall be developed utilizing the latest version of R.S. Means, or a similar program.  (Note   if the RS Means program is utilized, the cost estimates shall include both the R.S. Means  unit costs and R.S. Means  record identifier.)   

It shall be the responsibility of the A/E to advise the Government promptly when, in the A/E s judgment: the budgetary limitations prohibit design in conformance with the approved construction project scope.  If the A/E estimated cost of the project exceeds the amount indicated on the VA form, sufficient options shall be recommended by the A/E at the time of the 35% Review to establish the cost within the amount indicated on the project description.  Some of the agreed upon options may include additives in the final bid documents prepared by the A/E if the Contracting Officer and the A/E agree that it would be reasonable to do so. 

The construction contract documents submitted by the A/E shall represent the most economical engineering solution possible for the scope of work with A/E contract.  The construction document shall be in accordance and comply with current criteria, guides, and specifications established by the Department of Veteran s Affairs and shall be in accordance with the best Engineering practices.

<p>Note: The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A").</p>

<DESC>SINGLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT
1.  Introduction/Statement of Intent
This multiple year contract is to cover the anticipated Flight Standards and Aircraft Certification training quota for FY19 through FY24 in the Boeing 787 aircraft. The FAA intends to award a single source contract to Boeing US Training & Flight Service LLC, Renton WA 98055.
2.  Description of Supplies/Services
Requirement is for Boeing 787 Pilot Qualification Training consisting of Initial, Recurrent, and Simulator training.
3.  Total Estimated Value and Period of Performance 
The total estimated value of the planned single source contract inclusive of all options is estimated at $856,808.00.  The period of performance inclusive of all options is 04/15/2019  04/14/2024.
4.  Authority 
FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) authority for the planned single source procurement is provided by AMS Policy Section 3.2.2.4.
5.  Reasons for Single Source
The FAA Academy has a requirement for a Indefinite Delivery/Requirements, Multiple Year (Base and Four Option Years), Firm Fixed-Price contract using single source for Boeing 787 Initial and Recurrent Pilot Qualification Training. Boeing U.S. Training and Flight Services has certificated B-787 simulators within North America and is the only authorized provider for commercial customers with an approved Boeing 787 training program that will provide training to the FAA.  Obtaining the services on a single source basis is in the best interests of the government.
           United and American Airlines both have certificated simulators, however, they do not train anyone outside of their employment, which was verified on 07/20/2018 by the Supervisory Principal Operations Inspectors with the respective Certificate Management Offices.  
A Market Research  Searching for Vendors was announced on the FAAs Contracting Opportunities website (FAACO) on 10/30/2018 and closed on 11/02/2018 with no response received.

<SOLNBR>140F0119R0002
<RESPDATE>010919
<ARCHDATE>01242019
<CONTACT>Lautzenheiser, Karl
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Contracting and General Services (CGS) Region 1 has been tasked to solicit for and procure a firm-fixed-price for the construction of new bridges within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge. The base bid item (Pump House Bridge Replacement) is located in Washington County. The optional bid item (Gaston Pedestrian Bridge Replacement) is located in Yamhill County. 

Project is a small business set-aside.  Applicable NAICS code is 237310.  Small business size is defined as $36.5 million or less annually when averaged over a three year period.  The period of performance for the project is estimated to be around twenty-two (22) months with an end date of October 1, 2020. Project magnitude is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.

Site Visit: Firms interested in attending a site visit will meet on Tuesday, December 18, 2018, 10 AM local time at the Gaston City Hall, 116 Front Street, Gaston, OR 97119. If attending the site visit, please contact Karl Lautzenheiser at karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov by Friday, December 14, 2018.  There may be the possibility of a second site visit in the January 2019 time frame. If that happens, an amendment will be issued with details.  

Date for submission of Questions: Contractors should submit any questions on this project directly to Karl Lautzenheiser at karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov by no later than close of business on Friday, December 21, 2018. Questions will be consolidated and answers provided by issuance of an amendment directly thereafter. If a second site visit is entertained, the date for receipt of questions would be extended out and defined by amendment as well. 

The following is an overview of the required tasks. 

Base Bid Item - Pump House Bridge:
 
The proposed project involves the construction of a new bridge located east of Gaston in rural unincorporated Washington County, Oregon. The proposed project will be located within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which is owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and will include the removal of the existing wooden pump house bridge and the construction of the new Pump House Bridge (steel girder bridge) approximately 145 feet to the west of the existing bridge. The new bridge will consist of a 20-foot-wide, 91-foot long steel bridge with curb-mounted guardrails on either side supported by pile supported concrete abutments and gabion retaining walls. The project will also include construction of a gravel access road connecting the new bridge north to SW Gaston Road and a gravel levee access road connecting the new bridge easterly toward the existing pump house.  Access roads will include riprap slope protection and the installation of an access control gate north of the new bridge.  Construction work needed to facilitate the project includes excavation, fill placement, and grading in both upland areas and wetland/waterway areas located on the project site.
 
Optional Bid Item - Gaston Pedestrian Bridge:
 
The proposed project involves the construction of a new bridge located in south of Gaston (adjacent to the Gaston Feed Store), in rural unincorporated Washington and Yamhill Counties, Oregon.  The proposed project will be located within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which is owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and will include the removal of the existing wooden bridge and the construction of the new Gaston Pedestrian Bridge in the same location as the existing bridge. The existing bridge once provided pedestrians and vehicles access to the Refuge but currently it no longer provides a safe crossing. The new bridge will consist of an 8-foot-wide, 85-foot-long aluminum truss pedestrian bridge supported by pile supported concrete abutments and gabion retaining walls. The project will also include construction of a gravel access road connecting the existing dirt access road to the new bridge, and the existing levee will receive a new gravel access to account for the difference in elevations between the new bridge and the existing levee.  Construction work needed to facilitate the project includes excavation, fill placement, and grading in both upland areas and wetland/waterway areas located on the project site.


Basis for award will be "Lowest-Priced, Technically-Acceptable (LPTA)" Source Selection Process. LPTA shall be utilized in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 15.101-2. The lowest priced proposal will be based upon the combined total cost for all bid items. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of an offer meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.  There will be two (2) non-cost evaluation factors:  Recent Relevant Experience and Recent Relevant Past Performance.  To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than `Acceptable must be achieved for Recent Relevant Experience and Recent Relevant Past Performance.

The Government will first conduct a price analysis to determine fairness, reasonableness and if unbalanced pricing exists. Offerors proposals will then be ranked from the lowest to the highest-priced. The Government will then evaluate the technical proposal of the apparent, lowest-priced offeror. If the apparent, lowest-priced offeror's technical proposal is "Unacceptable" the Government will then evaluate the technical proposal of the apparent, second lowest-priced offeror. This process will continue until a lowest-priced offeror's technical proposal is "Acceptable." 
Once the Government identifies the lowest-priced, technically-acceptable offeror, an award will be made and no other proposals will be evaluated from offerors who proposed higher pricing.  
In determining whether a proposal as technically acceptable, the offeror must submit the following information with their proposal submission for evaluation:

1.	Recent Relevant Experience: Offerors shall be evaluated to determine whether they have performed similar contracts, in terms of scope and price, to the work required within the solicitation.  Offerors shall provide the minimum requested project information on at least one (1) recent, relevant project for a steel girder bridge (ten page limit) and at least one (1) recent relevant project for an aluminum truss bridge (ten page limit).  For a project to be considered, the offeror shall have been the Prime Contractor on it.  Projects do not have to have been with a Federal Agency to be considered.

A project is considered 'recent' if it has been completed within the past five (5) years or is currently ongoing (but at least 25% complete).

A project is considered `relevant if it is similar in terms of scope and price to the work required within the solicitation.  To be considered similar in scope, one project shall demonstrate work experience in steel girder bridge construction and one project shall demonstrate work experience in aluminum truss bridge construction and each of those projects shall have a contract value of at least $750,000.00 or more.  

Please note that FACTOR 1 (Recent Relevant Experience) differs from FACTOR 2 (Recent Relevant Past Performance).  FACTOR 1 determines whether or not an offeror has performed similar work whereas FACTOR 2 evaluates how well the offeror performed.

2.	Recent Relevant Past Performance: Offeror's past performance shall be reviewed to determine relevancy and confidence assessment.  Offerors shall provide at least one (1) recent, relevant project for a steel girder bridge (ten page limit) and at least one (1) recent relevant project for an aluminum truss bridge (ten page limit). Projects shall include current points of contact and phone numbers. The contractor is solely responsible for the accuracy of this information as the Government will not pursue incorrect contact data.

For a project to be considered, the offeror shall have been the prime contractor on it. In addition to scope, each project shall have a current or final contract value greater than $750,000.00 and have been completed within the past five past five (5) years or be currently ongoing (but at least 25% complete).  Furthermore, for each project to be considered, the offeror shall have been the Prime Contractor on it.  Projects do not have to have been with a Federal Agency to be considered. Offerors may submit the same projects as those proposed for FACTOR 1 (Recent Relevant Experience).

In addition to the above, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance.  Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE / Unique Entity Identifiers (i.e. DUNS) of team members (i.e. partnerships, joint ventures, teaming arrangements or parent companies / subsidiaries / affiliates) identified in the offerors proposals, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.

While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the offeror.

3.	Price: The total value of all tasks combined will be assessed to determine the overall Price Fair and Reasonable.  If any of the tasks appear to be unbalanced, a review of the breakdown of each task will be conducted.  

Offeror's prices for each item within the bid schedule shall represent the best price in response to the solicitation.  Prices will be evaluated using price analysis IAW FAR 15.404-1(a)(2) and 15.404-1(b).  Prices shall be evaluated to determine fairness, reasonableness and if unbalanced pricing exists.

Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated.  If price analysis techniques indicate that a proposal is unbalanced, the contracting officer shall consider the risks to the Government associated with the unbalanced pricing.  An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government (no page limit). 

Solicitation Number 140F0119R0002 with attachments is being posted on or about December 6, 2018 with proposals due by 2 PM PT on January 9, 2019.  Proposals submitted by mail channels must be received by no later that date/time specified with a 20 percent bid bond or proposals can be emailed to karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov along with a copy of the bid bond and the original bid bond must also mailed no later than the date/time for receipt of proposals.

No further notice will be posted on FedBizOpps.  To be considered for award, interested contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) must be completed at this same website.  For technical or contract questions, please contact Karl Lautzenheiser by email to Karl_Lautzenheiser@fws.gov.

To achieve this, the Department created several educational programs: Ethics Grand Rounds, held four to six times a year as part of the Clinical Center's Grand Rounds Program; a comprehensive training course, Ethical and Regulatory Aspects of Clinical Research, on the ethics of research; and a rigorous fellowship program to train bioethicists for the future.</p>
<p>In order to continually strengthen the training program for fellows, the <br />Department of Bioethics supplements its faculty by bringing in leading 	<br />ethics scholars to enrich and broaden the scope of ethics training received <br />by the fellows but also to bring new perspectives and to share these with fellows through teaching, mentoring and collaborative research.</p>
<p>David Wasserman, JD, MA is trained in law and psychology and interested in ethics and genetics, an important and growing field of bioethics.  He is co-editor of Harming Future Persons: Ethics, Genetics, and the Nonidentity Problem, as well as Quality of Life and Human Difference: Genetic Testing, Health Care, and Disability.  His many writings involve issues of ethics, moral status, health-care decision making, disabilities, risk and benefit, and other major areas of bioethics and research. The issues of genetic testing and management and releasing of test results are a major issue in research today.</p>

<p>UHPLC-MS Connection Kit<br />&bull; The UHPLC must have a Mass Spectrometer connection kit</p>
<p>Additional Minimum Requirements<br />&bull; Tribid Architecture: The Government requires a mass spectrometer system built on a mass spectrometer architecture that includes a quadrupole mass filter and two separate mass analyzers, an Orbitrap analyzer and a linear ion trap analyzer. The quadrupole can isolate select ions for transmission to the ion routing multipole. The ion-routing multipole features a higher-energy dissociation (HCD) collision cell, enabling ion storage with or without fragmentation, which then transmits ions to the selected mass analyzer or between the two analyzers. This unique architecture allows for parallelization (simultaneous precursor isolation, fragmentation, and data acquisition), increased scan rates, and ultimately increases the versatility of the instrument. The architecture also allows for MSn experiments using either the linear ion trap or Orbitrap as the mass analyzer at each MS stage.</p>
<p>&bull; High-Resolution Accurate-Mass Capabilities: The Government requires a mass spectrometer system with a mass resolution up to 500,000 at m/z 200. Confident compound identification relies on measuring the accurate mass of a compound to determine molecular weight and subsequently identify the chemical formula of an unknown. This increased resolution provides the resolving power to separate compounds with very similar masses (isobars), which in turn increases the certainty of a chemical formula for the identified accurate mass. Lower mass resolution instruments may not be able to separate isobaric compounds, leading to incorrect chemical formula assignments and a reduction in the ability to identify unknowns. The Government also requires a very low mass error of &lt;1 PPM when using internal calibration. Low mass error is equally important for identifying the exact mass of unknowns, for the same reasons noted above.</p>
<p>&bull; MSn Analysis: The Government requires a mass spectrometer system that is capable of MS/MS measurements, including MSn (n &le; 10). Even with very high mass resolution, isomeric compounds cannot be distinguished by exact mass alone since they have the same chemical formula. To fully elucidate the structure of an unknown, MS/MS and MSn analysis is critical. For some isomers, only MSn experiments can provide the spectral details required to elucidate structural differences among isomers or isobar. The Government requires a high-resolution instrument identified capable of generating MSn precursor and product ion full scan mass spectra, allowing for optimal unknown identification and structural elucidation.</p>

<p>The U.S. Government seeking full and open competition to lease space between 8,416-8,500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet of contiguous office space in Chattanooga, TN. This space shall be office and warehouse space combination. The facility shall have 24 hours 7 days a week, and 365 day a year access. Existing buildings with multi-tenants except retail stores and tenants that do not cater to heavy public use or heavy foot/vehicle traffic are acceptable. Professional office/research and development office parks in a class A building are acceptable. First floor and Second floor or higher are acceptable as well. The agency will require on-site secured parking for 10 cars and 20 foot setback from building to all sidewalks, access streets, parking lots, adjoining streets; a fence to meet the agency specifications needs to be included at lessor/owners expense. Blast film is provided at owners/lessor expense. The space must be located within the delineated area. The agency cannot be collocated with other Federal, State, local government agencies or private firms whose clientele are involved in or have ties to criminal elements and located near agencies providing probation and/or parole services, halfway houses, drug abuse counseling/rehabilitation programs. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of space that may potentially satisfy the Government's requirements as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease. A fully serviced lease is required. Offered space shall not be in the 100-year flood plain.</p>

<p>Part 1 - General Information <br />1.1 General: This is a non-personal services contract to provide installation of temporary fencing on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) lands in the Grandad Elk Mitigation Area near Dworshak Dam and Reservoir. The Government will not exercise any supervision or control over Contractor employees. Contractor employees shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government. <br />1.2 Objective: The objective of this contract is to install temporary fencing (Elk Exclosure) designed to exclude elk from a select area of habitat in the Grandad Elk Mitigation Area to protect young forage plants from ungulate herbivory. <br />1.3 Background (For Information Only): <br />1.3.1 Dworshak Dam and Reservoir (Dworshak Project) has several congressionally authorized purposes, one of which is to develop and sustain fish and wildlife habitat. In addition, it has a federal mandate to provide elk habitat (Design Memorandum 15 "The Plan for Development of Rocky Mountain Elk Habitat"). The implementation of this plan resulted in the acquisition and development of the Grandad Elk Mitigation Area, a 7,900 acre block of land designed to meet specific winter elk habitat objectives. <br />1.3.2 Approximately 3,000 acres of the 6,900-acre Grandad Elk Mitigation Area was clear-cut and burned in the 1970s to promote the production of winter browse species for elk. Although the efforts in the '70s were generally successful, today some of the clear-cut and burn units have very little elk winter forage and are thought to have inadequate seed source of these plants in the ground. Both of these conditions are primarily the result of elk herbivory. Although the '70s burns provided ample winter forage early on, years of continued elk herbivory have prevented winter forage from maturing, and harsh winters have killed many of the existing plants. Without maturing, these plants are kept from producing seed. <br />1.3.3 The Elk Exclosure will allow stunted plants to mature and produce seed. After several years, the fencing will be removed by the Government. The plants will have provided a new seed source to the landscape, and the mature, more vigorous plants will also be able to provide food for the elk without compromising plant survival. <br />1.4 Scope: The Contractor shall be required to install approximately 3800 lineal feet (based on three dimensional resource grade GPS measurement) of fencing, designed to exclude ungulates in moderately steep, vegetated terrain. See Part 4 - Specific Tasks, for further details. <br />More information in solicitation.</p>

<DESC>1. Description
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Advisory Multi-Step (AMS) Process related to Request for Proposal (RFP), W5J9CQ19R0003, is issued under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202, AMS Process.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>2. Introduction</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The U.S. Army Geospatial Center (AGC) is seeking qualified contractors for its procurement entitled "GRIDS III SBSA".&nbsp; The GRIDS III SBSA acquisition will be conducted using the procedures in FAR Part 15.&nbsp; The Government anticipates awarding up to 4 Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) awards.&nbsp; The GRIDS III SBSA contracts will have an estimated value of $48,000,000.00, and will have a base period of one year with four, one-year option periods.&nbsp; The NAICS code for the acquisition is 541715, Research and Development (R&amp;D) in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology) with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The contractor will need to possess and maintain facility clearances of at least Top Secret, Specialized Compartmentalized Information (TS/SCI) from the Defense Security Service (DSS).&nbsp; The contractor will also need to have a Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) approved accounting system for the performance of cost reimbursement task orders.&nbsp; The ID/IQ awards will allow for the issuance of both Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Reimbursement task orders.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>3. GRIDS III SBSA Scope</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The GRIDS III SBSA Scope will include a full range of services and solutions necessary for the AGC to coordinate, integrate, and synchronize geospatial information requirements and standards across the Army; develop geospatial enterprise enabled systems for the Army and the Department of Defense (DoD); and provide direct geospatial support to the Warfighter.&nbsp; The services acquired under this contract shall apply to the full range of security domains, from Unclassified through TS/SCI.&nbsp; See the attached GRIDS III SBSA Task Areas for the full scope of this contract.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>These services do not require registered or licensed architects or engineers.&nbsp; Any reference to geospatial data collection excludes Architectural and Engineering (A/E) services including surveying and mapping as it pertains to the design, construction, and repair of buildings, facilities and other real property.&nbsp; Data collection involving A/E quality work requiring these types of services by a professional land surveyor will be performed using other existing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) contracts that meet The Brooks Act: Federal Government Selection of Architects and Engineers (Public Law 92-582) requirements.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>4. AMS Process</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The AMS process is conducted to allow potential prime contractors to submit qualifying documentation demonstrating company qualifications that will allow the Government to advise them about their potential to be viable competitors for the GRIDS III SBSA acquisition.&nbsp; This AMS process asks potential interested offerors to submit limited information that focuses on the offerors: (1) Prime Contractor Technical Experience; (2) Clearances; and (3) Adequacy of Accounting System.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Government will evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria in paragraph 6 below, and advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor (including a general basis for that opinion).&nbsp; Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government, offerors identified as unlikely to be viable competitors as prime contractors may still participate in the resultant acquisition.&nbsp; The AMS process is entirely independent of the source selection process for the GRIDS III SBSA awardees.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>5. Submission Instructions</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>5.1 Format for Submissions - Potential prime contractors are requested to provide the information outlined below.&nbsp; Information beyond that requested or beyond page limitations set forth is neither desired, nor will it be considered in the assessment.&nbsp; All page limitations are based on single sided pages, 8.5 x 11 inch paper, single spaced, Arial typeface no small than 12-point (smaller fonts are acceptable for graphics, figures, tables, footnotes and legends), and 1 inch margins.&nbsp; Costly, complex submissions are neither required nor desired.</div>

<div><br /></div>
<div>5.3.1 - Prime Contractor Technical Experience - For each of the task areas listed in the "Task Areas" document attached to this notice, the interested prime contractor is to submit examples of its most "recent" and "relevant" project efforts to demonstrate its company's accomplishments in those areas.&nbsp; No more than one project effort may be submitted for each task area.&nbsp; It is required that the interested prime contractor submit a project effort for Task Area 5.1, Task Area 5.2, and Task Area 5.3 demonstrating that the interested prime contractor <strong>self-performed </strong>these three task areas.&nbsp; Interested companies are not required to demonstrate experience in all of the remaining task areas (Task Areas 5.4 through 5.15); however, the Government places a high value on responses that demonstrate a diverse portfolio evidencing recent, relevant efforts in response to all of the task areas.&nbsp; The Government is interested in seeing the interested prime contractor's breadth of experience both in self-performance of the task areas, as well as through the use of teaming arrangements with other qualified companies.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Responses are limited to no more than 30 pages and must demonstrate the interested prime contractor's ability to provide the required services identified in the attached task areas document.&nbsp; Interested prime contractors should use current or past contract examples for work performed within the past five years that is directly related to the requirements listed in the task areas document.&nbsp; Current examples shall be at least 50% complete.&nbsp; Respondents shall list any relevant work by specific contract number to allow for review.&nbsp; Additional information for each example shall include:</div>

<div>(12) Termination or Liquidated Damages Information: comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A project example is defined as a contract or task order where services or deliverables were performed or are still being performed anytime within five years of issuance of this AMS Process presolicitation notice.&nbsp; Interested prime contractors shall not use a base ID/IQ contract number as an example, rather a specific task order would be used as a project example under an ID/IQ contract.</div>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition Operations (OAO), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 23 Christopher Way, Eatontown, New Jersey, intends to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for the destruction of stored media currently located at the three VA National Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) located in Charleston, South Carolina; Leavenworth, Kansas City, and Tucson, Arizona.   VA requires the destruction and disposition of 6,018 Digital Linear Tape/Linear Tape-Open (DLT/LTO) media tapes, qualified vendors to destroy, and dispose currently stored media at the above locations.  Due to the fact that the stored media contains Protected Health Information/Personally Identifiable Information (PHI/PIIA) data, the VA requires that the stored media be destroyed by degaussing and pulverizing at the CMOP storage locations.  Once the media is destroyed, the VA requires a certificate of destruction report for each facility certifying that all DLT/LTO data tapes were degaussed and pulverized as part of the total destruction process.  The intended sole source award will be a firm-fixed price contract with Silent Security Services, Inc., 425 SW Dahled Ave., Port St. Lucie, FL 34953.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) only. This is NOT an invitation for bid (IFB), request for quotation (RFQ), or request for proposal (RFP). This notice is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Parts 10.002 and 15.201 in support of market research. No award is intended as a result of this RFI as the Government has no intention to pay for information received. A requirement has been identified for a contractor to provide processing support activities for the Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and the Insensitive Munitions Advanced Development (IMAD).
<p>These processing, production activities shall include mixing, casting and curing of a new IM rocket propellant into up to eight (8) government provided MK-36 rocket motor cases, and the delivery of the completed rocket motors to the Naval Air Warfare Center-Weapons Division (NAWCWD) China Lake for Insensitive Munitions IM testing.</p>
<p>The mission of the JIMTP is to develop, mature, and transition Joint Insensitive Munition science and technologies to improve the response of the Department of Defense (DoD) munitions portfolio to threats from combat, terrorists, and accidents. It is the goal of the JIMTP to provide a Science and Technology base to support the Secretary of Defense in ensuring that munitions under development or procurement are safe throughout their lifecycle when subjected to unplanned stimuli, to the maximum extent practicable. To that end, JIMTP has funded the development of a new rocket propellant that seeks to lessen the severity of the energy output when subjected to unplanned external stimuli, and increase the lifespan of a missile system through a change in formulation chemistry.</p>
<p>The mission of IMAD is to demonstrate and transition technologies that reduce the vulnerability and collateral damage of conventional munitions when exposed to heat, shock and impact stimuli. IMAD is Navy's primary 6.4 program to transition IM technology to Program Executive Offices (PEOs), and provides a strong risk reduction function for maturing technologies. IMAD is an enabler that facilitates PEOs' ability to integrate IM technology, and comply with DoD and Navy policy.</p>
<p>The JIMTP and IMAD programs have developed a limited distribution document that is categorized as Distribution F, as an attachment to this RFI that must be requested separately. It provides key formulation guidelines for the new rocket propellant that must be mixed, cast and cured inside MK-36 rocket motor cases to satisfy JIMTP and IMAD program objectives. These formulation details are derived from JIMTP and IMAD performance requirements, and Insensitive Munitions requirements associated with the development and demonstration of new propulsion technology for joint service applications.</p>
<p>To obtain a copy of the limited distribution document (LDD), interested parties must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office (See http://www.dla.mil/HQ/InformationOperations/Offers/Products/LogisticsApplications/JCP.aspx for instructions and information). Requests for the LDD shall be submitted in writing using AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire (Attachment 0001). The requester shall also submit a copy of the requester's DD Form 2345 Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement (Attachment 0002) that has been certified current by the U.S. and Canada Joint Certification Office (JCO), and a fully executed Non-Disclosure and Non Use Agreement (Attachment 0003).</p>
<p>The LDD contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.), as amended. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. This also applies to distribution of the LDD to all Subcontractors at every level.

This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. In the past, these requirements have been restricted to DataMill, LLC, PO Box 1711, Weatherford, TX 76086, CAGE Code 4UA41 under the basis of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 10.U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 8.405-6(b)(1), "Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer." However all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<p>Requirement Statement:</p>
<p>The Life Cycle Launcher Support (LCLS) team of the Precision Fires Rocket and Missile System (PFRMS) Logistics Division (LD) requires a standard logistics database that provides lifecycle tracking data in support of the Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Contract. PFRMS LD requires continuous visibility of high costs repairable spares as well as rapid and traceable shipments of serviceable spares to deployed units. LD also requires continuous visibility of return of unserviceable items for repair to ensure continued readiness of the overseas contingency operations deployed fleet as well as to support non deployed units. This database shall have the ability to interface with contractor field services representatives, and government personnel within the U.S. Army (Army) and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), for lifecycle tracking data that enables timely, cost-effective modifications and repair for weapon systems. The database encompasses information management processes for all aspects of an operations system. In order to fulfill this requirement, a commercially available subscription tool is required. The tool must contain the following attributes:</p>
<p>- Client/Server Architecture <br />- Encompasses Standard Logistics <br />- Stock Control and Distribution <br />- Lifecycle Availability Analysis<br />- Maintenance Data Collection<br />- Calibration Status<br />- System Status Reporting<br />- Secure Web-Based Interfaces</p>
<p>The license subscription shall be for one year from date of contract award, with four (4) option years.</p>
<p>RFI Purpose and Limitations:</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to better understand the current, state-of-the-art capabilities and strategies to determine the best solution. Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas. Proprietary information is neither solicited nor prohibited; however, if submitted, it should be appropriately marked. Please limit formal white paper submissions to no more than 10 pages, to include cover letter.

Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor FedBizOpps for additional information pertaining to this requirement. Multiple awards may be pursued depending on industry response.</p>
<p>All questions and industry responses shall be submitted electronically via email to Army Contracting Command-Redstone, Justin McDaniel, Contract Specialist, email address: justin.l.mcdaniel10.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a soliciatation or ultimately award a contract Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice.The Government will&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;&nbsp;be responsble for any costs incurred by the respondents&nbsp;to this notice.&nbsp; This notice is strictly for research and&nbsp;information purposes only.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND<br /></strong>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes, (NINDS) Cell Biology and Biophysics Unit (CBBU)&nbsp;conducts biophysical and structural studies on the microtubules and microtubule regulating proteins and the defects in this regulation in neurodegenerative disorders. The Unit must continue to order the series of baculovirus expression experiments which have lead to production of recombinant proteins required for the multiple ongoing&nbsp;research of tubulin and tubulin modification function in cells and in-vitro. The current projects require production and purification of engineered tubulin and proteins that serve as enzymes and substrates for the assays that the&nbsp;CBBU uses on a daily basis. Targeted proteins could not be obtained in bacterial expression system despite multiple approaches. The&nbsp;CBBU does not have high volume capacity and has time constrained capability to use any other expression system in house. The project is a continuation of the services provided by the University of Colorado Cancer Center to Protein Production /MoAB/Tissue Culture Core under a previous contract.<br /><br /><strong>SCOPE&nbsp;OF WORK</strong><br />1. Perform baculovirus expression experiments&nbsp;to produce recombinant proteins utilizing&nbsp;the following listed steps:<br />Step 1 Bacmid Transfection<br />Step 2 Plaque Purify Existing Viral Stock<br />Step 3 Production of viral stock at 250 ml or 500 ml scale<br />Step 4 Titer a virus<br />Step 5 Baculovirus protein production voumes from 1 liter flasks to 5 liter wave bioreactor</p>
<p>3. Store the custom high titer viral stocks from a series of large-scale of proteins expression in the insect cells.<br /><br />4. Store starting reagents (virus stocks) of proteins (expressed through our collaborative research for the past 3 years).<br /><br />5. Provide bacmid transfections, plaque purification assays, titer a virus, viral stocks production and large-scale expression.<br /><br />6. The quantity of each step may vary based on the results of the initial experiments (the first two steps noted above). It is not feasible to acurately determine the exact quantity of the remaining steps. If failure occurs during step one and/or step two, we do not proceed to the remaining steps. If the experiments are successful, then steps 3, 4 and 5 are repeated. As such; this contract will consist of a minimum and a maximum value. <br /><br /><strong>Antificipated Period of Performance</strong>:&nbsp;December 2018 through December 2019 with two additional twelve month option periods through&nbsp; December 2021.<br /><br /><strong>Capability statement information sought</strong>.&nbsp;Respondents that believe they possess the capability of producing&nbsp;the recombinant proteins using baculovirus expression methodology should respond with convincing and&nbsp;documented evidence to meet each of the project requirements.&nbsp;<br /><br />The respondent&nbsp;must also provide their DUNS number,&nbsp;organization name, address, point of contact, size and type of business, e.g. 8(a), Hubzone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing&nbsp; or finanlizing the acquisition requirements.<br /><br />One (1) copy of the response is required and must be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format using 11- point or 12- point font , 8-1/2'&nbsp;x 11 'paper size with 1' top, bottom left and right margins and with single or double spacing. <br /><br />The information submitted must be in&nbsp;an outline format that addresses each of the&nbsp;elements of the project requirement and in the capability statement information sought paragraphs stated herein.

<CONTACT>Elvis R. Colbert, Contracting Officer, Phone 2026934595, Email colbert.elvis.r@dol.gov
<DESC>1. Purpose<br />The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to assist the Department of Labor (DOL) in conducting market research to determine the interest and capabilities for Home Health Care Companies that are certified by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide nationwide (or by specific geographic location) home health care services.
<p>This request is for information purposes only to help DOL gain a better understanding of potential sources. Respondents must identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary. Any information submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the Government for information provided in response to this notice. This notice is NOT a solicitation or a Request For Proposal (RFP) and the Government will not award a contract pursuant to this announcement. No solicitation package is available at this time and requests for solicitation packages will not receive a response.</p>
<p>2. Background</p>
<p>The Division of Energy Employee's Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) provides worker's compensation benefits authorized by the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA or the Act). Part B of the program went into effect on July 31, 2001 and Part E of the program went into effect on October 28, 2004. The DEEOIC is responsible for adjudicating and administering claims filed by employees, former employees or certain qualified survivors under the Act. The DEEOIC is a specialized workers' compensation program within the U.S. Department of Labor with specific regulations and causation criteria. The program owes its creation to hazards that many employees faced during United States production of atomic weapons starting in the 1940s. Workers made sick from their exposure to toxic substances or surviving family members of deceased workers are eligible to receive federal workers compensation benefits. For living employee's suffering from an accepted work-related illness, DEEOIC provides coverage for necessary medical care.</p>
<p>3. Scope</p>
<p>There are approximately 21,500 DEEOIC covered employee's currently receiving medical benefits under the DEEOIC who reside throughout the United States. A DEEOIC covered employee is under no obligation to secure the services of a Contracted Home Health Care (CHHC) provider should HHC services be needed, and is free to select the HHC company of their choice. Home health care referrals are managed by DEEOIC&lsquo;s National Office operated out of Washington, DC. The interested Home Health Care Company must be certified by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and will be required to (1) Develop a tool for recruitment and oversight of home health care providers; (2) Utilize providers with the appropriate medical specialty for prescribed home health care services; (3) Ensure that the contract employees meet the professional qualifications required by their specialties; (4) Provide in-home health care services to DEEOIC's covered employees including Skilled Services (LPN, RN), Patient Care Coordinators (Case Managers), Certified Nursing Assistants, and Hospice Care. The licensed health care provider (i.e.: LPN, RN) will be responsible for oversight of unlicensed assistive health care personnel. Oversight tasks can include: determination whether the unlicensed assistive health care personnel is addressing the client's care needs as prescribed; establishment of when care needs exceed the safe capabilities of unlicensed assistive health care personnel; and evaluation of the outcomes of unlicensed assistive health care personnel delivered client care. The interested company is responsible for ensuring compliance with any required state licensures or certifications for unskilled nurses.</p>

<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 19-REG01.  In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Refer to AAAP RLP paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space requirement.  Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>This FBO advertisement is hereby incorporated into the RLP 19-REG01 by way of reference as an RLP attachment.</p>

The Lease and all documents that constitute the Lease package can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2018, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2019 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY19 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

Purpose and Objectives:

The intent of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify potential offerors capable of providing 300 Ergogenesis Dual Monitor Sit/Stand Desktops (part number EF-6033-AP02-B) to the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System located in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Salient characteristics of the required item are as follows:
The Sit Stand Desktop is used to allow great flexibility for both the seated and standing position.  The unit has one arm that extends over a worksurface and has 3 pivot points.  The Sit Stand unit eliminates a bulky chassis which takes away valuable work space on the worksurface.  The Sit Stand unit allows 18.5  of height adjustment on the keyboard tray and 8.3  of height adjustment for either a single or dual monitor application.  The Sit Stand allows the employee to have their worksurface space for paper and writing.  Sit Stand unit offers maximum adjustments for employees while not having to alter workstations to accommodate the unit.  The pneumatic lift on the single arm also aids in lifting the keyboard, mouse and monitors. This is essential for people that have shoulder and back issues as the arm helps lift the weight.

The option period one was inadvertently not exercised, however, the government still has a need for the services contemplated in the original award.   An informal analysis of prices and examination of the market indicates that an award to this contractor is more advantageous to the government than re-soliciting this requirement.   A Sources Sought Notice was published on FBO on 10/13/2016 and Strerigenics was the only responder to that notice. Based on this information there are no other vendor besides Sterigenics that have the requisite capabilities which are to provide training focused on the design and operation of industrial irradiator systems that contain licensed radioactive materials, with emphasis on Category IV, panoramic wet source storage irradiators.  A new solicitation will fail to produce a better price or a more advantageous offer than that offered by Sterigencis.
<p>Scope of Work<br />The Irradiator Technology Training contract will encompass contractor support to the NRC in providing irradiator technology training to NRC staff and Agreement State inspectors.  The training shall be focused on the design and operation of industrial irradiator systems that contain licensed radioactive materials, with emphasis on Category IV, panoramic wet source storage irradiators. The training solutions must include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Revise/Update existing training course materials for the NRC "Irradiator Technology" course<br />&bull;	Conduct a three-day irradiator technology training course for NRC staff and Agreement State inspectors and other approved attendees on gamma irradiator technology, up to two times per year.  The training shall include approximately one and one-half days of in-class lectures and one day of tours/hands-on activities at an operational Category IV pool-type irradiator. <br />*The Contractor shall provide students with access to an operational Category IV Pool-Type irradiator that is located within a one-hour drive of the location of the classroom.  Access shall include the irradiation room, the irradiator control console, and all associated safety equipment and monitors that are part of the irradiator system.&nbsp; The Contractor shall schedule detailed tours and hands-on activities to permit students to familiarize themselves with the safe operation of these irradiators.<br />&bull;	Provide a Course Presentation Report to the NRC Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) after each offering of the course.<br />&bull;	Provide a Final Report to the NRC COR.</p>
<p><br />Vendors that have the capability to perform the services discussed above shall submit a technical capability statement to Geoffrey Coleman, Contract Specialist at: Geoffrey.Coleman@nrc.gov no later than November 28, 2018. This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations, or a request for proposals.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division (ACC-APG-NCD), has a sole source requirement on behalf of Product Manager, Solider Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE) to manufacture 10,700 ensembles of the Army Green Service Uniform (AGSU). Incremental delivery requirements are 200 ensembles by 6 March 2019, 500 ensembles by 6 May 2019, and 10,000 ensembles by 7 February 2020.
<p>This acquisition is to manufacture the AGSU ensembles for a Limited User Evaluation and Low Rate Initial Production for issuance to Soldiers. The AGSU is a directed requirement from the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA). The current Army Service Uniform (ASU) does not adequately provide the fit and functionality desired for everyday wear in a business/business casual environment. Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier is developing an AGSU based on the World War II variant that will wear better and provide a distinctive look for Soldiers.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 315210. This acquisition will be conducted as a sole source contract to The Fechheimer Brothers Company of 4545 Malsbary Road, Cincinnati, OH 45242-5624. A firm fixed price contract is anticipated. Interested parties who believe they have a basis for meeting the incremental delivery dates, or other questions pertaining to this acquisition, may contact Matthew Buchanan at matthew.r.buchanan6.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<CONTACT>ABC Coordinator, Email ABC@darpa.mil
<DESC>Technologies for distributed consensus protocols have been revolutionized by their prominent role in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. These technologies have dramatic implications for the security and resilience of critical data storage and computation tasks, including for the Department of Defense (DoD). At the same time, the concrete applications and security of these technologies for the DoD is unclear. DARPA is interested in better understanding the broader implications that such technologies may play for the DoD. In order to investigate these technologies, DARPA intends to hold a workshop in February 2019 based upon responses to this RFI.

<CONTACT>Nestjorkina, Alina
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) in Portland Oregon, to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures. The RNAseq data are critical for allowing the Pacific Region FAC Program to carry out the mission of USFWS. This PR is to add new samples to a data set generated by Novogene in a previous contract. Because RNAseq data generated in different laboratories are not necessarily compatible with one another, it is necessary that Novogene perform the current work.
 The RNAseq data generated will be critical to the mission of USFWS Abernathy Fish Technology Center. They will inform us regarding the impacts of diets we are feeding steelhead in our national Fish Hatcheries, and thus impact the ability of the Fisheries and Aquatic Conservation Program to funciton. In following guidance of FAR Part 46.703 collecting these data is in the Governments best interests.
 There are no other sources capable of generating RNAseq libraries that we can guarantee will compatible with or standardized with libraries previously generated by Novogene. The barrier to competition is due to the sensitive nature of RNAseq library construction, and thus the lack of ability of other vendors to produce data compatible with those previously generated by Novogene.
Therefore, the USFWS has decided to award this purchase order as a sole source acquisition to Novogene, a large business located within Sacramento, California. 
NAICS: 611430; PSC: U009 Educational/Training General
No Solicitation or Request for Proposal (RFP) is available for this procurement. Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USFWS requirements described herein may submit a response no later than 11/21/2018 at 11 A.M (PST). Responses received will be used for future acquisitions. Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via email-only. A determination not to compete the described purchase order is solely based on the discretion of the USFWS. Any questions or comments should be directed to Alina Nestjorkina, Contracting Specialist,  via e-mail address alina_nestjorkina@fws.gov.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement to acquire the following services from Nuytco Research Ltd for the rental of Deepwork mini-submersibles and Exosuit 1-astmosphere Dive Suit (ADS).
<p>NASA/JSC intends to obtain these services from Nuytco Research Ltd. The scope of work includes rental of the Deepwork mini-submersibles, rental of the ADS, and mission support services. These services will support the joint underwater missions in support of operational tests where planetary exploration techniques and technologies will be developed. The mini-submersibles provide performance characteristics and operational challenges similar to those of both planetary rovers and unmanned robotics. The ADS brings many of the same challenges found in a space suit (e.g., reduced mobility, operator fatigue, reduced visibility) while also offering enough headroom to incorporate state of the art informatics solutions for evaluation. Astronauts will be trained to operate either or both vehicles, and will provide end-operator feedback to the tests. Current market research indicates that there are no other vendors available with the specialized equipment to provide the services needed for this requirement.</p>
<p>The Government intends to acquire the required service using FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the Contracting Officer, Ashley Alessandrini, at <a href="mailto:ashley.n.alessandrini@nasa.gov">ashley.n.alessandrini@nasa.gov</a> no later than 5:00 p.m. CST on November 28, 2018.

The required supplies or service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit, and function) with existing systems or equipment and the source is uniquely qualified to meet the requirement. JH Acquisition, LLC (EN-SCI) and Science Pump Corporation (New Jersey) are the only manufacturers of ECC ozonesonde. Items will be ready for pickup by March 1, 2019.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
VA s initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation.

Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.
A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed.  The Information Security Officer (ISO) needs to maintain the documentation.
SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH:  Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
Notification;
One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
Data breach analysis;
Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
TRAINING:  All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;
Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training;
Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and
Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access 
The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.
Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.<br />Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.<br />SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS<br />The PSC performs broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program spanning the full-range of citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan, which is of significant interest to the public and to Congress.<br />MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS <br />1.

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Needle Acupuncture. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1603-77_Needle_Acupuncture are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Needle Acupuncture products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil/">https://www.medical.dla.mil/</a>. <br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1603-77_Needle_Acupuncture. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 05 January 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MS-1603-77_Needle_Acupuncture, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Needle Acupuncture.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Needle Acupuncture. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $562,934 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MS-1603-77_Needle_Acupuncture who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><br /><strong>Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />1 -

Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. If all other requirements have been met, the lowest overall price will be selected for the IA for Standardization. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes, but reserves the right to seek further discounts or request revised quotes if determined necessary. <br /><strong>&bull; In order to be eligible for selection, vendors are required to have established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line by time of selection.<br />&bull; Failure to establish a DAPA with approved base uncommitted pricing will preclude a vendor from being selected to establish an IA with the government.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />MMESO South Clinical Analyst, Mr. Joe Winter, 210-536-6072, joseph.n.winter.ctr@mail.mil and MMESO South Team Leader, Mr. David Sheaffer, 210-536-6075, david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<p><br />Quotation Submission / Instructions</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:</p>
<p>Evaluation and award will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106<br />The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make a single award without conducting "discussions" as defined in FAR part 15. Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to request quote revisions that seek additional price discounts, provide revisions to the technical quote, or clarify aspects of the quote. In the event quote revisions are requested, the Government will not necessarily be seeking revisions from all quoters. The Government may reject any or all quotes if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received.</p>
<p>The Government intends to make an award to the quoter whose provides the lowest priced technically acceptable quote. Selection of a quoter for award will be based on an evaluation of quotes against the factors below in order of importance:</p>
<p>(1) Organizational / Corporate Experience,<br />(2) Staff Expertise and Qualification,<br />(3) Past Performance and.<br />(4) Price.</p>
<p>All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than price.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs set forth in the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. The merits of each quote will be evaluated carefully. Each quote must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. Quoters must submit information sufficient to evaluate their quotes based on the detailed factors listed below.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Process:</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this quotation to the responsible Contractor whose quote will be the most advantageous to the Government after price and other factors are considered. Responses shall demonstrate the following:</p>
<p>1. Organizational /Corporate Experience</p>
<p>The extent of a quoter's expertise and experience maintaining Labcyte ECHO 525 equipment. Its experience and ability to provide the full range of services specified in the SOW.</p>
<p>2. Staff Expertise <br />The technical qualification and certified experience of the staff maintaining Labcyte ECHO 525 equipment and providing the full range of services specified in the SOW.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL ADJECTIVAL RATINGS</p>
<p>Evaluators will apply the criteria of the following adjectives, (as appropriate to the individual factor being evaluated) as general guidance to be used when rating each of the technical factors listed above and the volume as a whole.</p>
<p>Rating<br />Adjectival Definition</p>
<p><br />Blue</p>
<p>Excellent The quote contains no deficiencies or only a very few and very minor weaknesses. Based on information provided, there is no doubt that the quote demonstrates an exceptional understanding of the services required to meet or exceed most requirements. The highest quality of performance is anticipated.</p>
<p><br />Green</p>
<p>Very Good The quote contains no deficiencies and only a few minor weaknesses. Based on the information provided, there is little doubt that the quote demonstrates a high quality of understanding of the services required to meet or exceed some of the requirements.<br />Yellow Satisfactory The quote contains no deficiencies and some weaknesses. Based on the information provided, the Quote demonstrates an understanding of the services required to meet the requirements.</p>
<p><br />Orange</p>
<p>Poor The quote contains deficiencies and significant weaknesses. Based on information provided, there is doubt that the contractor understands the services required to meet the requirements. Requirement/services can be met only with major changes to the quote.</p>
<p><br />Red</p>
<p>Unacceptable The quote has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; failure to understand much of the scope of work necessary to perform the requirements; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the government's requirements; failure to meet many personnel requirements in the solicitation. (When applying this adjective to a quote as a whole, the technical quote would have to be so unacceptable in one or more areas that it would have to be completely revised in order to attempt to make it other than unacceptable.)</p>
<p>3. Past Performance (Evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable)</p>
<p>Past performance information is one indicator of a Quoter's ability to perform the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, content of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance shall be considered. This evaluation is subjective and will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Quoter (for themselves, predecessor companies, key personnel, and major subcontractors), as well as information obtained by other sources known to the Government.</p>
<p>4. Price (Evaluated separately but not scored)</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Quoter's price for all items/services proposed. Option periods will be included as part of the total evaluated price. The Government shall evaluate price quotes to determine that they are fair and reasonable<br />Include the following information for each contract or subcontract:</p>
<p>1. Name of Contracting Organization<br />2. Contract Number (for subcontracts, provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number)<br />3. Contract Type<br />4. Total Contract Value<br />5. Description of Requirement<br />6. Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number<br />7. Program Manager's Name and Telephone Number<br />Each quoter may be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the quoter. Also, references other than those identified by the quoter may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation of the quoter's organizational experience.</p>
<p>The Government may evaluate the offeror's past performance on organizational experience based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance on organizational experience information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Quoter's price for all items/services proposed. Quotations will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition.</p>
<p>Additional Submission Instructions</p>
<p>The quote must be prepared in two SEPARATE volumes: Volume I - "Technical Volume" and Volume II - "Price/Business Volume". Each of these parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that the evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the evaluation of the other. The Request for Quote (RFQ) number should be included on the front cover of each volume.</p>
<p>Your quote must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ and signed by an official authorized to bind your organization. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt thereof by the Government.</p>
<p>This RFQ does not commit the Government to pay any of the costs associated with the preparation and submission of your quote. In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual authorized to legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this requirement. By submitting a quote in response to this solicitation, it is understood that your quote shall become a part of the official contract file.</p>
<p>The technical volume must not contain references to price; however, resource information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, etc., must be contained in the technical volume so that the Respondent's understanding of the scope of work may be evaluated. Quoters must provide clear responses, including objectives and outcomes, to each task addressing the work to be performed in the SOW. The technical volume must reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work being undertaken. Quotes which merely offer to conduct a project in accordance with the Government's requirements will not be eligible for award.</p>
<p>Full text copies of the representations and certifications for other cited provisions and clauses may be obtained on line at the NCI website at http://ncioa.cancer.gov/oa-internet/ or from William Neal, Contracting Officer at william.neal@nih.gov.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.</p>
<p>Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.</p>
<p>Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.

<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>- There is not a designated impact side.
<p>- The standard for frame thickness is 0.125". If you quote additional thickness it won't necessarily mean you better met the standard by exceeding it. The 0.125" thickness is base on market research of products known to meet our needs.</p>
<p>- The technical report for panels being tested as a complet system remains a requirement. Our market research has found vendors for this type of product that do have established systems that are produced to these specifications. This is also a re-solicitation due to a protest and when it was previously solicited we did receive proposals with the requested reports.</p>
<p>- If using subcontractors for production, ny past performance is acceptable; however, please make it clear that the past performance submitted is tied to your company's quote.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;The NIG Level III and UL752 Level 5 standard as a requirement is based on a SECDEF memo dated 1 Oct 2015. As stated in the memo, "...Ballistic internal protection (panels, desks, etc, with a minimum rating of United &lt;sic&gt; (UL) 752 Level 5 or National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Level III..."</p>
<p>- If you have an aluminum, or other material, frame that can clearly meet the rating, you may submit a proposal with this material. However, the technical evaluation will prefer the steel frame since the specifications call for "...armored steel...".</p>
<p>- The complete system is to meet the standards. Not just the glass panel or just the frame. It must function as a system.</p>

<div>This is a brand name requirement because the specific Fluidigm supplies requested are the consumable portion of our scientific experiments and are the only supplies that are compatible with our existing equipment and are necessary to conduct our research.&nbsp; The Fluidigm equipment that exists in our laboratory is unusable without the proprietary Fluidigm 96X96 Dynamic Arrays and Reagent Loading Kits.&nbsp; Also, Fluidigm uses a patented analysis system that restricts the ability of secondary manufacturers to produce compatible supplies.&nbsp; Thus, the Fluidigm Corporation holds the exclusive rights to manufacture these supplies.&nbsp; There is one known reseller that is authorized to resell Fluidigm products and services.</div>

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Chicago District, requires the utilization of a piece of Load Handling Equipment (LHE) and the services of a LHE Operator and Rigger(s) for the loading/unloading of eleven (11) bulkheads and one (1) lifting beam onto/off of two (2) Corps of Engineers supplied deck barges. The current property where the bulkheads are being stored is being sold and therefore the bulkheads need to be relocated. The bulkheads and lifting beam are currently stored at the Loomis Sampson Slip, located off Loomis Avenue, just North of the bridge over the South Branch of the Chicago River (approximately 22nd &amp; Loomis), Chicago, IL. The stop-logs are stored in a one-high configuration, placed on concrete blocks and wood timbers; positioned perpendicular to the edge of the dock (The waters of Sampson Slip). They will be relocated to the Thomas J. O'Brien Lock and Dam located on the Calumet River on the south side of Chicago, IL.
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for supplying an appropriately sized piece of LHE, all necessary rigging, spreader beam(s) and miscellaneous supplies to safely and efficiently load/unload the bulkheads and lifting beam onto and off of the Corps of Engineers supplied deck barges.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />Assured Supply for Soft Ballistic Material Manufacturing</p>
<p>United States Army, Program Executive Office Soldier Program Manager Soldier Personal Protective and Individual Equipment</p>
<p>1.0 Description: The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey-Emerging Technologies Contracting Center (ACC-NJ-ET), Benet Laboratories, on behalf of the Program Manager Soldier Protective and Individual Equipment (PM SPIE) of the Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060 is requesting information on current domestic (US/Canada) capable manufacturers for the creation and/or development of domestic infrastructure to support improved Soft Armor Ballistic Insert (SABI) material and for commercial applications as well as those applications required for the US Department of Defense (DoD) needs. The offeror(s) will demonstrate how they can provide specific implementation opportunities and information that contributes towards further development of manufacturing and production technologies and increase the capacity of the domestic critical infrastructure and frameworks needed for production of lighter and higher performing personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
<p>1.1 NAICS: The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) identifiers include: 315990 Apparel Accessories and Other Apparel Manufacturing.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, PM SPIE is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Offerors are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any are issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>2.1 The Problem: The U.S. Army has a need to deliver lighter and higher performing personal protective equipment (PPE) to the Soldier thereby increasing survivability and mobility. The Army has developed a next generation protection system called Soldier Protection System Torso and Extremity Protection (SPS TEP). The SPS TEP design consists of four (4) components: Modular Scalable Vest (MSV), Ballistic Combat Shirt (BCS), Blast Pelvic Protector (BPP), and Ballistic Battle Belt (B3). The SPS TEP allows Soldiers to tailor load and protection from Tier 1, Concealable, to Tier 4, Full Tactical. Improvements in low weight, high strength soft ballistic armor materials are the key to realizing further weight reduction while maintaining performance levels of Soft Armor Ballistic Inserts (SABI) that protect the Soldier from a full spectrum of threats. Currently the Government has an estimated near term requirement of at least 100,000 SABI and intermediate term requirement for at least 710,000 SABIs that will be produced as part of an anticipated five (5) year procurement contract. Non-U.S. competitors are challenging U.S. leadership in technology and production threatening the ability of U.S. companies to capitalize the market-driving technologies of the future and degrades U.S. national security. The current set of incentives offered by the U.S. can be better aligned to retain domestic capacity and leadership PPE.</p>
<p>2.2 Cost of Inaction: Other nations will innovate faster, capture market share, and obtain the best technology leaving the U.S. without a superior, domestic innovation and manufacturing base. The U.S. may lose the ability to realize the best ideas and capabilities across commercial and defense sectors, becoming dependent on competitor nations. A reliance on foreign-made SABI material with inferior quality and limited availability could increase risk to Soldiers.</p>
<p>2.3 Outcome Sought: DoD seeks to avoid these potentially disastrous outcomes, by assuring that the U.S. is the preferred global source for developing superior technologies faster, more efficiently, and with the highest levels protective properties. The U.S. retains and will leverage its existing infrastructure to advance SABI material development, supporting multiple domestic and DoD ecosystems providing services from material development, to component design, and integration in PPE systems.</p>
<p>Domestic development and production capabilities will drive and support these activities, sustaining leadership in translating leading-edge, advanced technology (RD&amp;D) into new products. Critical technology advancements in unique material properties, decreased areal density, improved ballistic performance, and SABI manufacturability will benefit the PPE by enabling products that are differentiated from foreign competitors by their increased performance and weight savings. Thus, DoD requirements can provide direct market incentives for assured products that U.S. commercial partners are uniquely positioned to provide.</p>
<p>3. DoD Actions and Requests: DoD recognizes the need to proactively engage with industry to make these efforts successful in delivering SABI technologies and providing value to the industrial base. DoD is executing a plan to provide SABI leadership now and into the future with a whole-of-government effort. PM SPIE is requesting information on behalf of the DoD on how to achieve the above goals most effectively. Offerors are encouraged to provide their perspective, input, and ideas for the structure and sustainability of their manufacturing capability, from RD&amp;D to production, ensuring DoD access to the capabilities it needs from domestic sources while providing value to industry through market-differentiating advantages. Sections below provide details of the response content and structure.</p>
<p>4. Technical approach: The offeror will provide an outline of the technical approach and describe capacity that could be made available immediately, 1-2 years, and through scalability over the next 3-5 years along with the associated Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit cost of the material in terms of cost per pound at the volumes proposed. Provide justification for how this approach meets the national innovation and DoD requirements for long term, economically viable, and assured SABI material supply across commodity and advanced specialized technologies. The business case should consider acquisition or access costs, capacity reservations or other purchase guarantees, annual operation and support costs, ownership, foreign ownership, control or influence (FOCI) concerns, support for low volume/high mix production, and the ability of the business to address US innovation and DoD special requirements and/or the diversity of its requirements.</p>
<p>5. Technical Objectives: In order to realize a significant SABI improvement, the following factor performance objectives have been developed. A description of an offeror's current values and suggestions for further improvement over the values listed in the table below, based on state-of-the-art materials, should be proposed. Material developed will be tested as SABI shoot packs to assess performance.</p>
<p>Factor - Areal Density (nonconsolidated)<br />Threshold - 0.75 lbs/ft2<br />Objective- 0.65 lbs/ft2</p>
<p>Factor- 9-mm, 124-gr Full Metal Jacket<br />Threshold- 1525 ft/s<br />Objective- 1750 ft/s</p>
<p>Factor- 17-grain V50 Fragment Simulating Projectiles (FSP)<br />Threshold- 1850 ft/s<br />Objective- 2550 ft/s</p>
<p>Factor- Maximum Back Face Deformation<br />Threshold- 44mm</p>
<p>Factor- Material Production Capacity<br />Threshold- 500,000 pounds per year<br />Objective- 5 Million pounds per year <br /><br />6. Cost/Funding Estimates and Methods: Provide a top-level break out of estimated implementation costs and the financial and other business arrangements and incentives necessary to implement capability and sustain viability. Identify recommended type of investments (loans, loan guarantees, purchase commitments, grants and cost sharing needed (e.g., RD&amp;D, production scale-up, engineering costs, equipment purchase costs, and business development costs) that would be required for implementation to include funding from all sources with special consideration for commercial and private sectors.. The business case should consider the commercial viability (e.g., customer base, market position, revenues, and profitability) of resulting property, goods, or capital. Responses should also address the anticipated impacts of increased assurance necessary to differentiate US produced products over less secure alternatives for their existing customer base to include the DoD. Describe any other factors, including policy and regulatory actions, potentially impacting the long-term availability and access to the design, material manufacturing, and SABI production in a US domestic ecosystem.</p>
<p>7. Cost Share: As it is intended that the technology required to meet the estimated outputs provided herein be readily marketable, DoD anticipates that the offeror will contribute funding as cost share if awarded a contractual instrument with the DoD. It is estimated that the offeror would provide 50% cost share to the maximum extent practicable. Estimate the likely cost share of the investment industry. Any government investments and incentives are to position domestic firms to become commercially viable, obtain a market leadership position, and support the limited DoD needs for access and availability.</p>
<p>8.0 Responses</p>
<p>8.1 Interested offerors responses may be up to 10 pages (front and back, 12 point font in Times Roman), and include their basic company identification information, which SABI material(s) they produce domestically, the location where they produce it domestically, who they produce it for (e.g., Commercial,/Law Enforcement, Federal and State government), etc.) and the quantity they produce (e.g., annual output) for each User/application. Respondents may include other information they think pertinent but it should be kept separate from the one page response.</p>
<p>Note: Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be reviewed only by US government personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>8.2 Offerors are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>8.3 White papers in Microsoft Word compatible or portable document format files are due no later than 28 December 2018, 12:00 EST. Responses shall be limited to 20 pages for Section 2 and submitted via e-mail only to giuseppe.tropiano.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>9 Industry Discussions: PM SPIE representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>10 Questions: Questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Giuseppe Tropiano (giuseppe.tropiano.civ@mail.mil). Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after 28 December 2018 will be answered.</p>
<p>11. Summary: This is a RFI only and meant to identify sources that can provide Assured Supply for Soft Armor Ballistic Insert (SABI) Material Manufacturing. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. DoD has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought.

<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - This RFI is released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. In the past, these requirements have been restricted to DataMill, LLC, PO Box 1711, Weatherford, TX 76086, CAGE Code 4UA41 under the basis of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 10.U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A)&amp;(B)--Only One Source and No Other Supplies or Services.

<p>Requirement Statement:</p>
<p>The Life Cycle Launcher Support (LCLS) team of the Precision Fires Rocket and Missile System (PFRMS) Logistics Division (LD) requires a standard logistics database that provides lifecycle tracking data in support of the Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Contract. PFRMS LD requires continuous visibility of high costs repairable spares as well as rapid and traceable shipments of serviceable spares to deployed units. LD also requires continuous visibility of return of unserviceable items for repair to ensure continued readiness of the overseas contingency operations deployed fleet as well as to support non deployed units. This database shall have the ability to interface with contractor field services representatives, and government personnel within the U.S. Army (Army) and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), for lifecycle tracking data that enables timely, cost-effective modifications and repair for weapon systems. The database encompasses information management processes for all aspects of an operations system. In order to fulfill this requirement, a commercially available subscription tool is required.

<p>- Client/Server Architecture <br />- Encompasses Standard Logistics <br />- Stock Control and Distribution <br />- Lifecycle Availability Analysis<br />- Maintenance Data Collection<br />- Calibration Status<br />- System Status Reporting<br />- Secure Web-Based Interfaces</p>
<p>The license subscription shall be for one year from date of contract award, with four (4) option years.</p>
<p>RFI Purpose and Limitations:</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to better understand the current, state-of-the-art capabilities and strategies to determine the best solution.

<DESC><p>SFL-TAP at its core is a transition assistance requirement or an employment assistance requirement that is concerned with compliance to the VOW Act. It is not a requirement to provide mental health services of any kind. This requirement has garnered many inquiries from mental health professionals and it now seems prudent to clarify this requirement succinctly, so this market segment does not labor under the illusion that the Army is seeking specific mental health outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, mental health care&nbsp;requirements would&nbsp;come from the Veterans Administration's contracting office.</p>

<DESC><p>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to solicit feedback from industry to address the remediation requirement for bulk field-constructed underground storage tanks (BFCUSTs) 1, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, and 15 at DFSP San Pedro. Specifically, the Government would like industry feedback on a proposed Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) related to performing a quality, cost effective solution. Interested parties are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement, point(s) of contact, and any comments or questions regarding this requirement to the individuals listed in this notice. Respondents should also provide any topics they would like to discuss at Industry Day before December 5, 2018. Industry Day teleconference is scheduled for December 11, 2018. A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to this notice.</p>
<p>DLA requires industry feedback to conduct market research and promote competition to the maximum extent practicable. DLA is seeking qualified sources to provide all non-Government-furnished personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to remediate seven bulk field-constructed underground storage tanks (BFCUSTs). Each BFCUST, surrounding treatment area, and contaminated plume zone is defined as a Site. The seven BFCUSTs are located at DFSP San Pedro (Facility) and were selected for in-situ thermal remediation (ISTR) technologies to include the following:<br />-&nbsp;Electro-thermally enhanced multi-phase extraction (ET-MPE) - BFCUSTs 1, 5, 7, 11, and 12; and</p>
<p>- Steam enhanced thermal extraction (SETE) at BFCUSTs 4, and 15.<br /><br />This RFI is for information and planning purposes only. The Draft PWS describes only the currently contemplated possible scope of services and may vary from the work scope in the final PWS. Do not submit pricing information in response to this RFI. Respondents will not be compensated for their submissions.&#12288;DLA will review all submissions received, and reserves the right to contact any or all respondents individually for additional information.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>- Based on the information in the PWS, could you fairly and reasonably propose the utilities if they were priced-in as a Firm-Fixed-Priced contract? If not, please explain why.</p>
<p>- If there's a premium on a firm-fixed-price contract, what is it?</p>
<p>- Do you anticipate the need for commercial financing?</p>

<p>The aim of the current procurement by the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology (DCEG), NCI, is to expand the scope and follow-up of Kaiser Permanente Washington (KP-WA) breast cancer survivors' cohort into the currently existing Kaiser/DCEG Breast Cancer Survivors' Cohort study (hereafter called DCEG Cohort). The existing KP-WA cohort already includes much of the required data captured over a similar time period (stage I and II invasive breast cancers diagnosed years 1990-2008, followed-up through August 2011) as the DCEG Cohort, making it an efficient and cost-effective addition to the DCEG Study, with the benefit of additional second cancer cases. The current procurement will: 1) retrieve physical radiotherapy summaries and radiation treatment plans for all exposed women with breast cancer diagnosed 1990-2008 with stage I, II or III disease, 2) expand the cohort to include stage III, and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) breast cancers diagnosed from 1990-2008, 3) expand the cohort to include of stage I, II, III and DCIS breast cancers diagnosed from 2009-2016, and 4) extend the follow-up on the full cohort through 2017.</p>

<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The specific aims of the procurement are:</p>
<p>Expanded cohort study: The current KP-WA cohort includes approximately 3,500 women who were diagnosed with a first primary invasive breast cancer (stage I and II) between 1990 and 2008 and who were follow-up through August 2011 for second primary cancers, vital status, and cause of death, and recurrence. This</p>
<p>procurement will expand this cohort to include stage III and DCIS breast cancers and to include breast cancers <br />(stage I, II, III and DCIS) diagnosed during 2009-2016. Further the procurement will expand the follow-up <br />period of all patients through 2017.</p>
<p>Radiotherapy study: The procurement will require KP-WA to retrieve and scan radiotherapy summaries from the medical charts for all exposed patients in the original COMBO cohort (1990-2008) plus patients with stage III breast cancer diagnosed between 1990-2008 from the expanded cohort (up to 2800 KP-WA breast cancer patients).</p>

<p>Solicitation 24322619R0001</p>
<p>NAICS 541612 - Human Resources Consulting Services<br />SBA size standard $15.0M</p>
<p><br />The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is seeking to obtain Strategic Human Capital Consulting and Technical Support Services for the HRLOB as a small business set-aside under solicitation 24322619R0001. The HRLOB is governed by the Multi-Agency Executive Strategy Committee (MAESC) consisting of twenty-four Federal cabinet agencies. The HRLOB initiative takes a line of business approach and builds upon previous e-Gov initiatives' successes. The HRLOB approach is to enable the Chief Human Capital Officer's (CHCO) vision and promote the government-wide strategic management of HC from "strategy to separation" to optimize Federal mission delivery.</p>
<p>HRLOB requires support in planning, developing, implementing and promoting Human Capital (HC) strategies to drive HC Standards and Management &amp; Modernization, HC Policy, Performance and Operations, and HC Community Engagement and Communication. The overall objectives are to (1) Create a modern, standardized human capital environment that meets the needs of the Federal workforce and enables the continuous improvement of HC management and service delivery, (2) Increase efficiencies in the acquisition, development, and delivery of HC services and supporting systems to improve service quality and reduce duplicative spend, (3) Enable collaboration between HC customers, providers, executive stakeholders, and supporting partners to leverage the government's collective expertise in establishing common HC principles, (4) Support the complete, secure, and timely sharing of information across an employee's career to improve workforce engagement and confidence in Federal HC management.<br /><br />OPM proposes to award a firm-fixed-price, single performance based stand-alone contract with a one-year base period and four one-year options but reserves the right to award more, less or none at all. The places of performanc will be on-site at the Theodore Roosevelt Building, located at 1900 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20415.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Given the significant rise in sales and capabilities, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) have quickly become a security concern due to the ease with which they can aid in intelligence gathering and/or be used as a malicious delivery platform. Federal agencies responsible for protecting facilities, personnel, and critical infrastructure have an immediate need for counter systems to these UAS.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Congress recently passed legislation granting DHS and component agencies limited authority to mitigate UAS threats at &lsquo;covered&rsquo; facilities. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The S&amp;T Directorate of DHS is requesting information on commercial</span> CUAS technologies to inform an understanding of the current technical capabilities, features, and costs of commercial-off-the-shelf technologies This information will be used by DHS S&amp;T and its subcomponents to identify candidate technologies for a range of applications. For this reason, information on all CUAS technologies and systems is being accepted only through a standardized questionnaire.</span></p>
