<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is sponsoring an Industry Conference for all Real Estate Colleagues in the San Antonio market areas to introduce the Advanced Acquisition Program.
EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST REGISTRATION PERIOD OPEN 7/10/2006 – 7/14/2006

CONFERENCE SUBJECT:

The Advanced Acquisition Program (AAP) is a monthly opportunity for offering building space for lease to the Federal Government.  GSA has streamlined the lease acquisition process in the Greater Southwest Regions markets through utilization of this program.    

You are invited to participate in a General Services Administration (GSA) sponsored industry conference to introduce the Advanced Acquisition Program (AAP).  The conference is scheduled for Tuesday, July 18, 2006 from 1:00 P.M. until 4:00 P.M at the Omni La Mansión del Rio Hotel (on the Riverwalk), San Antonio, Texas.   The purpose of the conference is to introduce the Advanced Acquisition Program and solicit input from real estate firms interested in offering space to the government through this automated offering system.  

AAP is a standardized multiple award platform that will be utilized in the San Antonio market for award of future GSA lease acquisition space needs.  GSA has explored the markets within the Region 7 boundaries as well as special emergency management program needs where the AAP program would provide the streamlined acquisition process needed.  The San Antonio market has been identified as one of the markets where GSA will implement the AAP and it is the government's intent to utilize the AAP program for all lease contract awards that fit within the program's parameters.   Topics to be discussed at the conference are, 1) History of the Advanced Acquisition Program, 2) How will the program work, and 3) What advantage does it provide the Private Sector.  

We are interested in your ideas and experience in leasing to the government and input on how this program can best be utilized in the San Antonio market areas.  Please keep in mind that we are trying to be responsive to what your industry’s needs are in deciding how to best streamline the lease acquisition process and encourage competition.  Our goal is to get the best people in the industry, at the best price, to work with us.  You don’t have to prepare anything for this meeting; just bring your ideas and experience.  Please do not bring marketing materials or any written proposals.   

We are looking forward to seeing you at the conference.  If you have any questions, please contact either Tracy Harter, Realty Specialist, at (210) 472-6040 X228 or Kelly Hantz, Realty Specialist, at (817) 978-6154.  If your firm has not already registered its attendees for this conference, please do so in advance by sending an email to Tracy Harter at Tracy.Harter@GSA.gov.

The Coastal Response Research Center (CRRC), Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology (CICEET), the Minerals Management Service (MMS) and the Prince William Sound Oil Spill Recovery Institute (PWS OSRI) formed a partnership and jointly issued a Request for Preliminary Proposals for FY-2006 Cold Climate research. The CRRC is a partnership between the University of New Hampshire and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Additional information about the CRRC can be found at www.crrc.unh.edu.  The CICEET is also a partnership between the University of New Hampshire and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Additional information about the CICEET can be found at www.ciceet.unh.edu.   The FY-2006 Cold Climate Request for Preliminary Proposals had a number of specific topic areas for oil spill research.  There was a very extensive review and selection process of the White Papers received under this RFP and then for the full Technical and Cost Proposals that were requested by the funding parties. MMS determined that only one of the projects would benefit the MMS, and would therefore be funded.  This project is entitled: "Oil Recovery with Novel Skimmer Surfaces under Cold Climate Conditions" submitted by University of California, Santa Barbara, Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.   The objectives of this proposed research project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the adhesion processes between oil or ice-in-oil mixtures and various surface patters and materials that are being used or proposed for use in oil skimmers will be conducted under cold climate conditions (0o-5o C) water temperature.  This research project will also conduct field scale oil spill recover tests at the US Army Corps of Engineers, Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) in Hanover, NH with three different oils.   The PWS OSRI determined that this project was also suitable for funding and wished to partner with MMS to jointly fund this project and to leverage research dollars.  The PWS OSRI will fund the laboratory portion of the project and MMS will fund the Ohmsett testing portion of the project.   This project will be conducted in two phases.  The Prince William Sound Oil Spill Recovery Institute will fund the first phase.  The MMS will provide sponsorship funding for the second phase in the amount of $102,921 for a two year period of performance.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541690 "Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services." This notice is not a formal solicitation.  This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No award will be made on the basis of quotations or offers received in response to this notice.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities.

<DESC>Request for Expression of Interest The Department of Energyâ€™s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) has asked NETL to create the Modern Grid Initiative, a coordinated national program to facilitate the modernization of the U.S. electric transmission and distribution system. OEâ€™s intent is to engage all stakeholders in developing a shared vision of a modern grid and help achieve that vision by conducting regional demonstrations of integrated technologies and processes to revolutionize the electric grid. NETL is requesting  an Expression of Interest from technology developers, equipment manufacturers, vendors, integrators, service providers and any other parties interested in supporting the effort to achieve the characteristics and address the key technology needs of the Modern Grid as described below. Please describe your firmâ€™s background, proposed role, any technologies for integration and demonstration, and benefits that will result from your involvement in the Modern Grid Initiative.  Responses must be received by August 30, 2006.  All responses must be sent to Patrick M. Findle at patrick.findle@sa.netl.doe.gov and submitted in Adobe Portable Document (PDF) format.  Companies with multiple core capability can provide one response covering each technology area.  Questions relating to the expression of interest should be directed to Patrick M. Findle at patrick.findle@sa.netl.doe.gov. Please limit your response to a two page summarization when printed using standard 8.5 inch by 11 inch paper with 1 inch margins (top, bottom, left, and right) with font no smaller than 11 point.  Responses can include references to web pages for additional information.  Summarization of your technology, equipment, service, or facilities should include: - Company Name, company description, technical point of contact information; - Name, description of the technology, equipment or service and its uniqueness; - Alignment with the Modern Grid Initiative's Key Technology Areas, contribution to achieving the Principal Characteristics, possible benefit to the grid and support of the Modern Grid Initiative; - Stage of technology - R&D, Ready for integration and demonstration; Anticipated timing to market use; - Types of technology, R&D tasks, services and partners you are interested in to compliment / collaborate with your efforts. For more information go to: www.themoderngrid.org The seven principal characteristics of the Modern Grid are outlined as follows: Self healsâ€”The grid monitors itself and automatically detects, analyzes, responds to, and restores grid components or network sections to maintain reliability, security, affordability, power quality, and an efficient state. Motivates and includes the consumerâ€”Individual, business, and industry consumers become integral, active parts of the electric power system. Participating in electricity markets will benefit both the individual consumer and overall system reliability. Resists attackâ€”It is critical for the modern grid to address security from the outset, making security a requirement and ensuring an integrated and balanced approach across the system. Provides power quality for 21st-century usersâ€”Sensitive loads represent an increasing portion of the total power system load. The power quality delivered by the modern grid must be improved to meet the requirements of these sensitive loads.  In addition, improvements in the design of the loads will make them more tolerant of distorted power. Accommodates all generation and storage optionsâ€”The modern grid will accommodate a portfolio of diverse generation types, necessitating a greatly simplified interconnection process analogous to plug-and-play in todayâ€™s computer environment, particularly at the distributed energy resources level. Enables marketsâ€”The modern grid will integrate electricity markets into the fabric of the electric system because operations, planning, pricing, and reliability are dependent on how open-access markets are designed and instituted. For this reason, it will not only support wholesale electric markets but also retail markets where applicable. Optimizes assets and operates efficientlyâ€”Assets will be managed in concert so that, as a system, they can deliver functionality at a minimum cost. For example, advanced sensing and robust communications will allow early problem detection and corrective action. With the principal characteristics driving the development of the Modern Grid, key technology areas will emerge to enable desired performance. A focus on technology and innovation will be encouraged and is, in fact, required to achieve the functional specifications of the principal characteristics and ultimate success. The key technology areas proposed are the following: Integrated Communicationsâ€”High-speed, fully integrated, two-way communications technologies will establish the infrastructure needed to enable the modern grid to become a dynamic, interactive â€œmega-infrastructureâ€ for real-time information and power exchange. Its open architecture will create a plug-and-play environment that securely networks smart sensors and control devices, control centers, protection systems, and users. Sensing and Measurementâ€”New digital technology applications will accommodate a variety of inputs, deliver a variety of outputs, and maintain interfaces among generators, grid operators, and customer portals. They will function to enhance power measurement, provide outage detection and response, evaluate equipment health and grid integrity, eliminate meter estimations, provide energy theft protection, enable consumer choice and demand response, and facilitate congestion relief. In addition, new smart sensors will be applied to various grid-monitoring functions. Advanced Componentsâ€”The next generation of power system devices will take advantage of new material technologies, nanotechnologies, advanced digital designs, etc., to produce higher power densities, better reliability, and improved real-time diagnostics to greatly improve grid performance. These technologically advanced devices will include superconducting transmission cable, fault current limiters, composite conductors, Flexible AC Transmission Systems, advanced energy storage, distributed generation, advanced transformers and circuit breakers, and smart loads. Advanced Control Methodsâ€”Grid monitoring will be an essential element of reliability and security. Advanced control methodologies, such as computer-based algorithms, will support distribution and substation automation, adaptive relaying, energy management, market pricing, grid modeling and simulation, advanced visualization systems, and other grid elements. They will also integrate with asset management processes and technologies to further optimize grid operations and planning. Improved Interfaces and decision supportâ€”In many situations, the time available for operators to make decisions has shortened to seconds.  Thus, the modern grid will require the wide, seamless, real-time use of applications and tools that enable grid operators and managers to make decisions quickly. This includes the role of artificial intelligence to support the human interface, operator decision support (e.g., alerting tools, what-if tools, course-of-action tools) semi-autonomous agent software, visualization tools and systems, performance dashboards, advanced control-room design, and real-time dynamic simulator training.

<DESC>Purchase two gas heated oven units for our composite facility - one small and one large. 
Approximant dimensions for large oven

Inside dimensions: 8'W x 12'D x 6-1/2'H
Outside dimensions: 10'W x 16'D x 7-1/2'H

Approximant dimensions for small oven

Inside dimensions: 4'W x 10'D x 6-1/2'H
Outside dimensions: 6'W x 12'9"D x 7-1/2'H


Control and data acquisition systems require having both ovens controlled through the same computer system mounted in a main central free standing control console.

Keeping in mind the 30'W x 20'D area in which the two units must be installed.  Heater boxes will be in the rear for both units because of the 11' overhead clearance restriction.  Blower drive motors will be oriented keeping service access in mind for both units. Access outside roll up door to the building is 14’W X 10’ H

Software, to allow for data transferred to customer supplied computer to be charted through spreadsheet software, to allow for real time monitoring, data acquisition and archiving on customer computer through customer supplied Ethernet cable.  

Desktop computer and inkjet printer, to be dedicated to programming, operation, data acquisition and printout of run data for the systems. 

Programming and setting up the system for operation with the multiple vacuum ports
And thermocouple jack locations.

Door switch, to shut down heat and circulation if doors are opened while chamber is at elevated temperatures.  This feature will protect operational personnel if the oven must be opened while operating.

The oven will be designed for composite curing of various parts, where it is assumed that the total load weight will be approximately 1,000 lbs. or less, including all tooling and racks.

Rate of heating and cooling is assumed to be the same as the aerospace industry standard, i.e. 4 to 7 deg. F per minute.  To provide for control of the cooling rate, we have included an exhaust blower controlled through a variable frequency drive.  Rates of heating and cooling can always be slower than stated above; as a slower rate can be set into the programmer Maximum operating temperature for this oven will be 500 deg. F.  It is understood that the normal operating temperature will be in the neighborhood of 350 to 400 deg. F.

No Floor -

The oven will be provided without a floor of its own.  The customer=s concrete plant floor will act as the floor of the chamber for maximum flexibility in loading.

Vacuum Ports - 

The oven will be supplied with eight (8) vacuum ports, four (4) per side, evenly spaced from front to back.  An external header will be provided on each side of the oven, with a total of four (4) legs projecting into the oven chamber on each side, terminating in barb type connections.  A check valve will be supplied every 4 ft. on the external headers.  Each leg will be provided with its own ball type shutoff valve, and the main headers will be provided with a ball type shut-off valve where connection is made to the customer supplied vacuum source.  Adjacent to each port will be a second port, leading out to a Honeywell digital indicating vacuum transducer, which will feed its signal to the HC900.  

A vacuum line is taken from the primary vacuum port to the bag around the part.  A second line goes from the bag to the secondary port, alongside the primary port, so vacuum is read downstream of the bag.  This allows for bag leaks to be detected.
	
Thermocouple Ports - 

A total of eight (8) thermocouple jack positions will be provided on the interior wall of the chamber, with one (1) jack position adjacent to each vacuum port.  Matching male jacks will be provided for customer use.  Jack positions will feed their signals to the HC900.

Installation and oven start-up, check-out and operator training

The contractor will deliver all required items in accordance with the upcoming solicitation posting on or around Tuesday 12 July 2005.  The delivery date shall be on or before 30 September 2006.  This solicitation is a 100% set aside for small businesses.

It is the Library’s understanding that the identified 213-nm Nd:YAG laser is the only one commercially available in the U.S. that is capable of meeting the Library’s critical performance requirement for a laser ablation system that also meets the following needs:  It must be a dedicated, deep UV, internally homogenized 213-nm Nd:YAG laser that can provide high absorption for UV transparent materials (> 80% for calcite), fine particle size distribution of ablated material (all particles < 0.5µm), high sample transport efficiency with helium as a cell gas (> 200% increase of signal), low depth of penetration (to < 0.1µm/shot) for high depth-spatial resolution, and an ablation spot size down to 4 microns;  it must have a hybrid-resonator with energy output via a motorized, software-controlled optical attenuator to deliver variable amounts of energy (maximum of at least 27 J/cm2) measured at the sample by a built-in energy meter that can be monitored in real time;  it must have a safety system that is an Open Architecture Class 1 shield plus interlocks to accommodate large format and specialty sample cells and permit direct viewing of the sample during ablation; it must have a software-controlled gear-driven aperture wheel to control the beam size with constant energy density to provide spot sizes ranging from 4-110 microns, and a beam expander to control beam size with varying energy density to allow automated switching between focused beam and aperture imaging modes; the sample stage must have 0.20-micron resolution and travel up to 52 mm in both the x and y planes with calibration in the x, y, and z directions; the sample chamber must be cassette style and measure at least 60 mm ID x 52 mm inside height for thin sections, thick sections, irregular specimens and standards; the sample cells must include a paper/wafer cell and a minimum-volume low-flow sample cell; it must include a color CCD camera and frame grabber that is software controlled with magnification 5.6 to 36X optical and 180X to 1200X image magnification to provide optical resolution of at least 2 microns; the laser ablation software must be able to operate with an OES or MS computer and monitor and allow for bi-directional control between the laser system and the OES or MS data collection software via TTL/CMOS compatible signal voltages or switch relay closures; and real-time sample viewing during ablation must be possible so that easy targeting of sample micro-features is possible using cross-hair positioning with software control of three light sources with variable intensity.  Any other company that, at the time of application, (1) is either legally incorporated as a U.S. business entity or capable of demonstrating through its business plan its intention to be fully incorporated as a U.S. business, and (2) believes its GC-MS system can meet all the above equipment performance requirements can apply to the Library for consideration.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Library to Arneen Dozier via email at adoz@loc.gov. No phone call please

The following requirements to the above quantities are as follows: the variety of weapon sights and irradiating devices to be evaluated span a rather wide range of wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum (visible band—VIS, near infra-red band—NIR, and the short wave infra-red band—SWIR) and therefore require test equipment and targets that can encompass that wavelength range.  The test equipment targets necessary to characterize these sights must present a uniform Lambertian source of light radiation over a 180 degree field-of-view that spans the 400 nm to 1800 nm spectral region, and that exhibits a very white, highly reflective (equal or greater than 99%) surface quality within that region of the spe!  ctrum.  These targets must provide reference standards that can be app lied to the variety of systems under test in both a laboratory environment as well as a field environment.  In addition, the evaluation of active systems require the characterization of the power emitted by sources which include lasers, visible flashlights and IR illuminators  Additionally the equipment must be able to be calibrated with traceability to the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).  The equipment that is produced by Labsphere, Inc. and cited in this requisition enables that characterization of all these weapon sights and active sources, and in these bands of radiation.  The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using simplified acquisition procedures and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR parts 12 and 13. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is NOT a request for c!  ompetitive proposals, as the Government has determined that there is no other vendor that meets the requirements set forth above. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Questions concerning this intent can be e-mailed to: crystal.m.clark@usmc.mil or faxed to number (703) 432-3526. The date and time of closing is MONDAY, JULY 17, 2006, 3:30pm EST (Eastern Standard Time).

The vision of the federal e-Gov HR LOB initiative is government-wide, modern, cost effective, standardized, and interoperable Human Resource (HR) solutions providing common core functionality to support the strategic management of Human Capital.  The OMB and OPM competitively selected the NBC as one of five federal HR shared service centers.  Through this solicitation, the DOI and NBC will obtain business planning, systems engineering, and systems integration services in support of the HR LOB initiative.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a sample preparation and visualization system consisting of a high efficiency ion polishing system combined with a Charge Coupled Diode (CCD) digital imaging system.  The ion-polished samples will be imaged in an existing NASA instrument (transmission electron microscope (TEM)) which will be modified to include the CCD camera. Specific Requirements for the sample preparation and visualization system: (1) The ion polishing system must be a completely self-contained, ultra-clean, oil-free, compact, bench-top instrument designed to produce high-quality TEM specimens with exceptionally large, clean, electron transparent areas.  The system must allow for single- or double-sided ion milling.  The ion guns must be accurately and independently positioned to center the beams onto the specimen at any angle within a variable range of 0 to ±10 degrees in order to produce extremely high thinning rates at shallow glancing angles of incidence to the specimen.  The gun angle should be able to be changed at any time during operation.	Specimen exchange in the system must be fast (&lt;30 seconds) and not expose the sample to atmosphere when loading and unloading.  The capability of transmission or reflection illumination of the specimen during the milling process is required as is the ability to accurately determine specimen thickness by the interference fringe technique.  Specific requirements of the ion guns are: •	Two Penning ion guns each independently adjustable to permit either rapid milling or slow precise ion polishing. •	Ion beam energy shall be continuously adjustable from 1keV to 6keV. •	Beam width at the sample shall be no larger than 400µm FWHM for standard guns and no larger than 850µm for Broad Beam guns.  •	The milling angle shall be continuously variable from +10º to –10º and fully adjustable during operation. •	Gas throughput:  Less than 0.1cc/min per gun at 5kV. •	The ion guns shall have no consumable parts. The specific requirements for the vacuum system are: •	The vacuum system shall be totally self-contained within the enclosure. •	A totally oil-free vacuum system (2-stage diaphragm pump backing a 70 liter/second Molecular Drag Pump). •	Work chamber base pressure:   5E –6 Torr  •	Operating pressure:   &lt; 6E –5 Torr. (2) The sample visualization system will consist of a CCD camera interfaced to a JEOL 2000FX transmission electron microscope (TEM).	The system must also be compatible with an existing analog camera and more importantly with a retractable transmitted electron detector.  The specific requirements for the CCD camera system are as follows: •	The CCD shall be an astronomy grade CCD with a minimum of 2048 x 2048 pixels. •	Each pixel size shall be a minimum of 14µm x 14µm in physical size, not effective size. •	The CCD shall be fiber-optically coupled to the phosphor scintillator incorporating a single fiber stack. Lens coupling or reduced fiber optic tapers shall not be accepted. •	A Peltier cooling system shall be standard. Air-cooled electronics and/or electric fans shall not be accepted. •	The CCD camera shall have the ability to be interfaced to and to be fully compatible with the following accessories: a Gatan 622 camera, Gatan retractable BF/DF (brightfield/darkfield) STEM detector. •	The camera shall be mounted below the film plate chamber of the TEM. It will be pneumatically retractable, mounted on-axis, and have a sensor installed to automatically retract the camera head into a vacuum enclosure whenever the microscope camera chamber is about to be vented. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Gatan, Inc., the only known manufacturer that produces an acceptable CCD imaging system that is compatible with the existing camera and detectors currently in use on the JEOL 2000FX TEM in the ARES electron beam laboratories.  The same CCD camera exists on a similar electron microscope within our facility; therefore, ARES personnel training can be avoided.  More importantly is the fact that this CCD camera is the only one known that will properly mate with this existing microscope to produce the ARES requirements for this laboratory.  As a compliment to the CCD camera, the sample preparation portion of this system includes the Gatan ion polishing system which is also a component familiar to ARES personnel. The Gatan system is also compatible with existing equipment and produces the specific sample preparation requirements for the unique samples studied by ARES scientists. Utilizing equipment similar to existing ARES equipment minimizes the required user training.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 14, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

Work shall be concluded by December 1, 2006.  Evaluation factors for award will be previous experience in reproduction treatments and price, each factor being approximately equal in weight.  Magnitude of this project is $25,000 to $100,000.  Procurement is being conducted as a small business set-aside.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Dr. Elena Naumova/Tufts School of Medicine to support the coordination and organization of the multi-partner international collaborative project, examining the effects of climate variability on waterborne illness in Russia, under the Bio-Chem Redirect nonproliferation initiative.  The current NAICS code is 541710.

Based on the EPA’s knowledge of the Technical Support needed for the Statement of Work (SOW) there may be unique capabilities to particular contractors/consultants.  The SOW is as follows:

TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND WATERBORNE
                                        ILLNESS PROJECT IN RUSSIA

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	The initial period of performance shall be from August 31, 2006 to August 30, 2007.  The first option period shall be from August 31, 2007 to August 30, 2008.  The second option period shall be from August 31, 2008 to September 30, 2009.

Estimated Hours/Level of Effort (LOE):  576 Hours  

BACKGROUND:
Increased greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic sources such as the burning of fossil fuels can contribute to global climate change.  Global climate change is predicted to increase climate variability and frequency of extreme precipitation events in temperate areas.  It may also increase the frequency and magnitude of other extreme weather events, such as sudden snowmelt, heat waves, floods, and droughts, and have profound effects on public health.  Changes in temperature, humidity and precipitation can affect the incidence of infectious disease. Heavy precipitation and resultant runoff have been shown to increase concentrations of viruses and protozoa in surface water bodies. 
 
Russia ranks third behind the U.S. and China in emission of CO2, one of the main greenhouse gases.  Global climate change is expected to result in elevated ambient air temperatures and higher frequency of extreme rainfall in Russia during the 21st century.  Time-series data from 11 countries over the past 60 years show increases of 2-4% in heavy precipitation events for the former USSR per decade, behind only Australia and South Africa.  An increase in extreme weather events may limit the ability of basic water treatment systems in many Russian cities to adequately remove chlorination-resistant pathogens, such as protozoa and viruses.  Furthermore, an increase in gastrointestinal infections from increased exposures may disproportionately affect populations susceptible to infectious diseases, such as the elderly, pregnant women, young children and the immunocompromised.  The elderly is a rapidly growing population in Russia, as is the immunocompromised population due in part to the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus infections.

Examining the potential effects of global warming on waterborne illness is complex due to the inherent uncertainty of prediction modeling and requires an interdisciplinary approach.  This necessitates consideration of the vulnerability of water supplies to changing climate and extreme weather events and integration of infectious disease models with models describing weather-related occurrence of pathogens in water.  Analyses of the potential effect of climate change on waterborne disease requires consideration of secondary (i.e. person-to-person) transmission, acquired immunity, multiple exposure pathways and spatio-temporal variability in exposures.  Immunity and interactions between individuals cause populations to behave as systems with non-linear dynamics.  Dynamic models of infection spread in the population enhance microbial risk assessment and provide information to support risk management decisions on water treatment options.  The development of data analysis systems and data-based disease prediction models may provide decision makers with useful information to develop infectious disease forecasts.  It may also help to predict seasonal outbreaks of infections that are triggered by climate variability.

DESCRIPTION OF TASKS:
The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain contractor support for the coordination and organization of the multi-partner international collaborative project examining the effects of climate variability on waterborne illness in Russia under the Bio-Chem Redirect nonproliferation initiative with funding provided by the Department of State through the Office of International Affairs.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   Modeling of the Oxidation of Mercury in a Pilot-Scale Combustor This is a request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ  number is RFQ-OH-06-00172.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-09.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.   The NAICS code  is 541710, and the size standard is 500 employees.   STATEMENT OF WORK Period of Performance:  12 Months from the date of award  Estimated Level of Effort:   The level of effort for this project is estimated to be 250 hours. Goal  The goal of the proposed project is to perform and validate a  definitive kinetic study of mercury oxidation mechanisms that characterizes the impact of flue gas temperature gradients and heterogeneous reaction mechanisms on the extent of high temperature mercury oxidation.  The proposed work would further EPA's mission as follows: "The work would serve to  explain the variability in mercury emissions often observed and documented under EPA's Information Collection Request and will provide a foundation for the extension of studies now being conducted to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. "The work would validate an established kinetic  model for mercury speciation, which would be a valuable national resource as utility and industrial coal-fired boilers implement technology to meet mercury regulations through a wide range of national coal supply.  The emphasis on gas quenching rates and supplemental unburned carbon will fill an  important gap in the current understanding of mercury oxidation mechanisms. "Results would be published in a peer reviewed journal and at technical conferences to add to the national knowledge base on mercury and to disseminate the results to a wide audience. Approach  1. Areas of interest and  parameters to be modeled include the following model runs: "Flue gas economizer inlet and outlet temperature variation. "Flue gas temperature gradient (within economizer) variation. "Coal type variation (subbituminous and bituminous). "Coal chlorine and mercury content variation. "Fly ash carbon  level variation. 2.  Model simulations will be performed using Contractor's existing kinetic model for mercury speciation. "Obtain parametric predictions for oxidized mercury entering and leaving all units in the gas cleaning system based on: variation in flue gas temperature entering and exiting  heat exchanger. FLue gas quenching rate variation. Fly ash unburned carbon level variation.  Coal rank and chlorine content variation. "Model simulations will be used to generate kinetic curves, as follows: Extent of mercury oxidation vs. flue gas quench rate Extent of mercury oxidation vs.  economizer inlet temperature Extent of mercury oxidation vs. economizer outlet temperature Extent of mercury oxidation vs. unburned carbon level Extent of mercury oxidation vs. coal rank/chlorine content 3.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.    The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to the West Virginia University Research Corporation (WVURC), Department of Statistics, for follow-on work related to Purchase Order No. 200-2005-M-13695 that was awarded to WVURC in FY 2005 under a competitive solicitation.

The agency’s need for local, on-site statisticians continues to exist for the upcoming year, and recompeting the requirement would be disruptive to the ongoing research projects by causing significant time loss and project delays.  Owing to the steep learning curve to become integrated into these projects, it would not be cost effective for the agency to recompete the existing requirement.  Accordingly, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) the agency considers the West Virginia University Research Corporation as the only vendor capable of meeting the agency’s needs.  Thus, this notice is being issued for information purposes only; no solicitation is being issued as negotiations will be conducted on a sole source basis with the WVURC.

The follow-on effort requires a PhD level Principal Investigator and two PhD level Statisticians (one 10% and one 20%) for a period of one year.  The statisticians will provide statistical advice to researchers in support of the NIOSH Division of Respiratory Disease Studies/Field Studies Branch (FSB) and will provide Statistical Analysis System (SAS) programming and statistical analysis support.  FSB will provide day-to-day technical direction on individual projects.  Data that will be managed and analyzed by the contractor is subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act and Assurance of Confidentiality.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office, National Environmental Data Information Service (NESDIS) Acquisition Division (AD) proposes to solicit from and negotiate with only one source, The Aerospace Corporation, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, to acquire scientific and engineering support for independent, objective assessments focused primarily on the launch of space systems, and in some instances, on ground systems for NOAA/NESDIS satellite systems.

The NOAA/NESDIS manages NOAA’s operational geo-stationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellite programs. The NOAA/NESDIS objective is to provide the spacecraft, launch services, and ground systems necessary to maintain the uninterrupted flow of remotely-sensed environmental data required to promote, protect, and enhance the Nation’s economy, security, environment, and quality of life. NOAA/NESDIS has the need for research and development support from an FFRDC free from organizational conflicts of interest to accomplish tasks which require objectivity and independence and which are integral to the agency mission.

The requirement consists of support with architecture planning and development, acquisition, systems development, operations, and assessments of technology opportunities and alternatives for future and current satellite programs. The Contractor's role in the NOAA/NESDIS organization is as an independent, objective, non-competitive Corporation whose mission under this contract is to support the program objectives of the NOAA/NESDIS and related NOAA programs. The Contractor will provide non-advocacy assessments of program implementation, design approach, advanced pre-development planning, developmental and operational risks, integration and test data analysis, launch readiness assessment, on-orbit performance assessment, ongoing analyses of associated technologies, and support to failure analysis inquiries. The Contractor will provide technical assistance and advice in the preparation and resulting evaluation of complex technical specifications. The contract will be for approximately 97 staff (maximum on-site and off-site full time employees) per year, effective December 1, 2006, for a base period of one (1) year plus four (4) one-year options.

The Aerospace Corporation is considered to be the single, experienced capable source qualified to support NOAA/NESDIS with the required independent engineering analyses. The Aerospace Corporation is the incumbent contractor who was awarded a contract in September 2000 to provide these services to NOAA/NESDIS. The Aerospace Corporation, a FFRDC, formed in 1960 by the USAF, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. Sect. 2367, completed a Comprehensive Review in June 2003 that was approved by the Under Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development reaffirming The Aerospace Corporation’s mission to support national security, civil and commercial space programs. The work to be acquired under any follow-on contract falls within the purpose and special competencies of The Aerospace Corporation’s Sponsoring Agreement with the U.S. Air Force. The Aerospace Corporation’s personnel have first-hand knowledge of the engineering design of delivery systems and the spacecraft platforms of military and civilian polar-orbiting and geosynchronous spacecraft. The Aerospace Corporation’s experience includes the integration of military, civilian and foreign meteorological sensors, the impact of command, control and communications links between the ground control stations and the platforms/systems, and the analysis of satellite instrument data. The Aerospace Corporation maintains the unique competency and diverse expertise through its long-term design support and engineering review of civilian and military meteorological satellite platforms. Its corporate and business practices protect Government and industry's interests and objectives by safeguarding proprietary and privileged information from misuse, and reducing the Government's costs due to duplication, delay, and other general programmatic risks. The Aerospace Corporation’s corporate resources and facilities help advance the Government objectives to promote competition, reduce costs of acquiring and operating the converged satellite systems, and satisfy the programmatic requirements for NOAA/NESDIS.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Other parties who desire consideration for this requirement must fully identify their capabilities in writing to the Contracting Officer within 45 calendar days of the posted date of this notice. See Numbered Note: 22.

<DESC>The Mass & Force Group of the Manufacturing Metrology Division in the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) maintains and disseminates the SI unit of mass, the Kilogram.  As such, it provides to the 50 States, state and federal agencies, as well as private entities and individuals and sometimes foreign entities, a calibration service which disseminates the unit of mass based on the National Kilogram Standard of Mass.

The mass standard is artifact-based which is susceptible to damage or destruction.  New alternative methods for the realization of the kilogram leading to a non-artifact-based system are currently under development and require mass measurements in vacuum.  

The 10-kilogram vacuum balance and vacuum chamber system are a crucial part of developing the required vacuum mass measurement methods.

The purpose of this contract is to supply to NIST a 10-kilogram vacuum-compatible balance (“vacuum balance”) installed in vacuum chamber system (“chamber”).  The vacuum balance must be operational according to NIST requirements under vacuum conditions and also in air within the chamber.  

The vacuum chamber is divided into two chambers – an upper and lower chamber.  These two chambers shall operate simultaneously under vacuum or in air, or operate with one in air while the other is in vacuum.  

A hoist system (“hoist”) must be supplied and installed with the chamber system in order to open the upper chamber for full access to the vacuum balance.  The entire vacuum balance and chamber system and hoist must be installed and tested to meet NIST specified requirements. 

Upon successful completion of this requirement, the Contractor shall have provided NIST with a 10-kilogram vacuum balance and chamber system as outlined below.  NIST will provide to the Vendor electronic files (SolidWorks-format drawings) to illustrate NIST’s requirements and specifications.

The period of performance shall be 13 months from the date of award.
	
This requirement is being competed using Full & Open Competition under the authority of FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.

A fixed-price contract is anticipated.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFP number SB1341-06-R-0029.

THE RFP IS ANTICIPATED FOR RELEASE TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY ON OR ABOUT JULY 13, 2006, AND WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET AT THE ABOVE WEB SITE.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCESSING THE WEB SITE.  

Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  

A site visit shall be conducted for this requirement.  Please reference the solicitation for site visit information.

THERE IS NO WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT AVAILABLE, TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED, AND NO BIDDERS LIST WILL BE MAINTAINED.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via email to Carol.Wood@NIST.GOV.

Such products are “Exact Products” as defined in DLAD 52.217-9002: “Conditions for evaluation and acceptance of offers for Part Numbered Items”. A vendor’s offer, is a certification that the “Exact Product” manufactured by the entity cited above, will be furnished under the proposed contract. Any product not manufactured by Titan Wheels (20076), will be considered as an “Alternate Product”, even though it might be manufactured in accordance with the drawings and/or specifications of the entity cited. If an “Alternate Product” is furnished under the proposed contract, the “Alternate Product” will be an unauthorized product. Since there is no expectation of receiving offers from manufacturers, other than Titan Wheels, this acquisition is unrestricted.

The proposed contract is for a two year base, and contains an option to extend the term of the contract for three (3) additional years, on a yearly basis. This procurement also contains a guaranteed minimum.  Expected delivery is 100 days ARO.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>072806
<CONTACT>Sandra Fink, (405)954-8860
<DESC>SYNOPSIS FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION MARKET SURVEY FOR INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES General Information: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources that can provide instructional support services required by Airway Facilities Division (AMA-400), at the FAA Academy, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Overview -The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing instructional and related support services to augment existing Airway Facilities Division (AMA-400) staff in the completion of its tasked activities. The contractor will provide those on-site personnel needed to effectively manage and supervise the contract staff and perform clerical and administrative functions.  The FAA Academy is a resident training center. On average, AMA-400 has 579 active courses that provide approximately 1250 resident class deliveries per year. This equates to approximately 6500 resident completions and 832,176 resident hours annually.   The requirement centers primarily on the instructional delivery of AMA-400 technical training. This includes theoretical and practical training in one or more subjects on assigned National Airspace System (NAS) equipment and systems for field technical experts involved with the installation and maintenance of such equipment and systems.  Delivery of instructional courses is in accordance with FAA training procedures, guidelines, and methodologies. Instructors are required to follow prepared lesson plans and ensure stated course objectives are presented.  Instructors will utilize such teaching methods as lecture, lab demonstrations, and remedial discussion. The instructor selects/uses or develops teaching aids such as, but not limited to, lesson plans, student guides, lab guides, handouts, wall charts, prepared notes, and use of actual lab equipment.  Contract instructors may also be required to provide support as subject matter experts in the development, revision, and maintenance of course materials, utilizing all applicable media.   The FAA may also identify requirements for other instructional support personnel including but not limited to, instructional systems design specialists, course developers, technical  writers, and illustrators. The instructional system design specialist is responsible for organizing and conducting research, development, evaluation, revision, and maintenance of training materials for resident, field, and distance learning training courses, supporting the National Airspace System (NAS). Knowledge of major principles and theories in human learning and cognitive psychology is required in order to determine instructional objectives and task learning relationships, classify instructional objectives, and develop course content sequences.  Additionally, knowledge of principles, methodologies, and techniques of task analysis is required in order to ensure training outcomes are congruent with required knowledge, skills, and abilities. Instructional development and revision of course materials and support media for resident, field and distance learning courses would be performed by course developers, illustrators, and technical writers with applicable experience in the following areas: art and design, drafting, desktop publishing, computer animation, courseware development authoring languages, ability to proofread and edit material for reports, manuals, briefs, proposals, instructional books, catalogs, and training publications, or related specialty materials. Past Performance and Experience - The FAA is looking for a contractor with a proven track record of excellence in the performance of contracts in an environment of a similar size and complexity.  The contractor is required to show three (3) years experience within the past five (5) years in instructional support and delivery.  Past and present contract performance information must demonstrate the contractor is capable to perform the proposed effort.  The contractor should demonstrate technical expertise and capability to perform the requirements listed.   This announcement is not a Screening Information Request or a Request for Proposal of any kind.  All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or for any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from SBA certified 8(a) firms and small business concerns.   The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing instructional support services.    At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the AMS this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other small business competitive procurement procedures. The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611710, Educational Support Services, with a size standard of $6.5 Million.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter (if applicable). The failure to obtain adequate 8(a) or other small business participation in this market survey may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures. Response to this Market Survey - Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA. All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead.  No type font less than 12-point may be used.  Responses must be received no later than 3:30 P.M, Central Time on July 28th, 2006.

     answer:  yes, all seminar rooms are on the 2nd floor and there is no elevator service.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to Solicitation Number GS-07P-06-HHD-0029 is to change the set-aside status from Total HUBZone to Full and Open Unrestricted.  Procurement is Full and Open Unrestricted.  Three (3) copies of the Standard Form 330 and other pertinent information must be received no later than 3:00 PM Central Standard Time on August 8, 2006, from firms desiring consideration.

Procurement is Full and Open Unrestricted.  The North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541310, Architectural Services, and corresponds to SIC Code 8712.

NAICS 541310 Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for supplemental A/E services for a period of one year with four 1-year option periods.  Place of Performance:  The contract will be for services within the state of Texas, Zone IV Central Texas, which is the primary contract area.  Texas Zone IV currently includes, but is not limited to:  Austin, San Antonio, San Angelo, Waco, Laredo, McAllen, Corpus Christi, and Brownsville.  On or about July 2009, the cities of Austin and Waco will be removed from the primary contract area.  On an occasional basis, work may also include locations in the secondary contract area.  The secondary contract area consists of the states of Oklahoma, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas.

The A/E firm selected shall primarily provide:  design, construction management and inspection, and estimating services for repair and alteration projects, but may also be required to provide scope development, planning, interior design, environmental studies, feasibility studies, problem analysis, design review, consulting design, construction management for elevator work, geotechnical testing, quality control testing, asbestos and mold sampling, hazard assessment, abatement design, air quality monitoring, boundary and topographical surveying, historic structure reports, building evaluation report and other architectural, engineering, and technical services.  The work will require primarily architectural, mechanical, electrical and estimator disciplines, but may also require civil, structural, geotechnical, environmental, certified industrial hygienist, fire/life safety, elevator, acoustical, historic preservationist, construction manager/inspector, surveyor and other disciplines with specialized experience.  

The minimum guaranteed contract amount is $1,000 for the base year and each of the option years, if exercised.  There will be no limit to the amount paid on individual task orders and no limit on project size; however, the total cumulative task order amount shall not exceed $3,000,000 in any one-year contract period.  Projects, while there will be no limit on size, will generally involve repairs, alterations, and improvements in connection with existing construction cost.  A/E firms will be evaluated in terms of their professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services, specialized experience and technical competence in the fields of energy conservation, pollution prevention waste reduction, the use of recovered materials and services regarding asbestos related work.  

Selection criteria for this acquisition are listed below in descending order of importance:  (1) Experience:  Experience of the firm and consultants with regard to providing the types of services described above, and with regard to accomplishment of past projects including repair and alteration work.  (2) Management and Inspection Capability:  Experience and capability of the firm and consultants with respect to complete management and inspection services for projects of the type described above during the construction phase.  (3) Technical Ability:  Professional qualifications, expertise and education level of individuals employed by the firm and consultants who will be directly involved in providing the above described services and their philosophy concerning the design of repair and alteration work.  (4) Management/Organization/Production/Quality Control:  Producing a high quality design, maintaining good working relationships, working with repair and alteration projects, meeting schedules, providing accurate cost estimates, and tracking and controlling costs.  (5) Geographical Boundaries: Demonstrate that at least 35 percent of the A/E contract services (based on total contract price) will be accomplished within the primary geographical boundaries of Texas Zone IV for the resulting contract.  

The Government will not indemnify the firm against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials, that is, no clause holding the firm harmless will be included in the contract.  A Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating FFP task orders.  A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing task orders for projects with an estimated construction cost of less than $2,000,000 will be included in the contract.  The Government will use the fixed price amount in the lookup table which will be a function of project size, type, and complexity.  The lookup table will be provided to the A/E during initial contract negotiations.

Firms, when responding to this announcement, should address their capability with regard to each of the evaluation factors listed above, as the top rated firms recommended for interview will be recommended solely on their written response to this announcement.  Architectural or engineering firms wishing to be considered must submit three (3) copies of completed Standard Form (SF) 330 and other pertinent information (see FAR 53.236-2(b)).  This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Procurement is Full and Open Unrestricted.  Offerors, prior to being awarded any contract exceeding $500,000 ($1 Million for construction) shall be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan (see FAR 52.219-9) or demonstrate that no subcontracting opportunities exist.  This provision does not apply to small business concerns.  In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the A/E will be required to submit a plan for providing the maximum practicable opportunities for small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, GSA has established subcontracting goals. The current GSA PBS subcontracting goals are:  66.00 percent for Total Small Business, 4.64 percent for Section 8(a), 15.96 percent for Small Disadvantaged Business, 5.40 percent for Women-Owned Small Business, 4.00 percent for HUBZone and 2.28 percent for Service-Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB).  The North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541310, Architectural Services, and corresponds to SIC Code 8712.

<DESC>The following replaces the previous notice posted July 3, 2007:

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plans to solicit proposals from qualified organizations having in-house capability to perform in vivo rodent and primate pharmacology studies of new drugs of abuse and potential pharmacotherapies for drug dependence disorders.  Primate studies will include the evaluation of test compound effects in opiate-dependent monkeys.  Contractor-generated data on new drugs of abuse will be provided to the DEA by NIDA.  Contractor-generated data on potential pharmacotherapies will be used by the NIDA Medications Development Program.  The Contractor will be blinded to the identity of proprietary test compounds and all compounds will be evaluated in established assays, as specified by the NIDA Project Officer.  In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that offerors possess a DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V and demonstrate the capability to obtain a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances.  All offerors must be in compliance with the NIH guidelines on the care and use of laboratory animals.

We anticipate the award of one cost reimbursement contract for a period of five years.  The contract will include additional options to cover increased quantities.  RFP No. N01DA-7-8859 will be available electronically on or about July 18, 2006.  You will access the RFP through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NIDA website: (URL: http://www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html).   All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in or accessible through the electronic RFP package.  Response to the RFP will be due on or about September 15, 2006.  NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  See Note 26.

<DESC>****THIS IS SET ASIDE FOR PRIME 8A CONTRACTORS.


It is highly encouraged that 8(a) firms create either; a MENTOR-PROTÉGÉ relationship, JOINT VENTURE relationship, or a TEAMING PARTNERSHIP relationship through subcontracting efforts with either large or small business(s).  These teaming arrangements shall be evaluated as outlined in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a suggestion from the government and not a directive; therefore it shall be totally the 8(a) firm(s) to decide what the best opportunity will be for its’ company to achieve the requirements set forth in the (RFP).  The Department intends to award one contract from this announcement to an 8(a) contractor who best meets or exceed the requirements established in the attached request for proposal, award fee plan and award term plan.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost and/or price and technical standpoint.

This announcement is the follow up to a sources sought synopsis posted Aug 26, 2005, and it’s modification to synopsis dated; Sep 9, 2005; the solicitation number is SAQMPD05I1006.  This announcement super-cedes both.

The Office of Acquisition (AQM) in the Department of State seeks to issue an 8(a) competitive procurement on behalf of the Bureau of Resource Management, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Financial Services (RM/GFS) to assist the Department in its effort to provide financial services in support of overseas and domestic operations at the Global Financial Services (GFS) in Charleston, SC.  These services include Disbursing, Accounting, Payroll, Payments, and operations in support of these activities, including services related to the operation and maintenance of local area networks, maintenance of installed systems supporting automated financial systems and systems analysis, user support and training related to install automated financial systems, and other related services.  These activities currently employ approximately 300 full time personnel.  Labor categories will include but not limited to program management, financial, information technology, and administrative services.  The Department desires to award a single contract for this support to (GFS) Charleston.  The contract will primarily focus on the (GFS) Charleston, but support services will be needed by other (RM) Bureau organizations.  Therefore, the Washington DC metropolitan area will be a secondary place of performance, with a projected 5% of the total contract requirement designated for Washington area (RM) Bureau usage.  Therefore the vendor must have or establish a facility in the Charleston Metro area.  There will be a need for contractor personnel to travel between Charleston, SC and the Washington DC metro area (DC, MD, VA), as well as some overseas travel, all travel will be handled through task orders.  
 
Capability statements from potential 8(a) Mentor-Protégé program, Joint Venture Agreements and Teaming Partnerships with subcontractors’ relationships shall be reviewed as acceptable or non-acceptable in accordance with Small Business Administration’s regulations concerning these specific teaming arrangements.  


Offerors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this (RFP) and site visit travel to the Pre-Performance Conference.  The Pre-Proposal Conference/site visit is scheduled to be held June 13th, 2006 at 1:00pm Eastern Standard Time (EST), at the Global Financial Services, Charleston, SC 29415-5008 as outlined in the RFP.  All Offerors who anticipate on attending the Pre-Proposal Conference must e-mail three (3) names as a maximum, to Mr. Pete Jones’s e-mail address provided in the last paragraph of this announcement.

All questions concerning the (RFP) shall be received on or before June 23rd, 2006.  Any questions received after that date shall be returned unanswered and shall not be considered.  Please submit your proposal as described in Section “L” of the (RFP) no later than 4:00 pm EST on Thursday, July 18th, 2006, to: JonesPW@state.gov. Please submit all questions to Mr. Pete Jones via email related to this RFP. No telephone call questions shall be entertained. Point of Contact: Mr. Pete Jones, Contract Officer/Specialist 703-875-6273.

An Official Solicitation will be posted on FEDTEDS and in FEDBIZOPS upon receipt of finalized documents from internal sources to be published as the official solicitation.  It is anticipated that the official solicitation will be published early in July, 2 006 however a firm date has not yet been established.   Please continue to watch the FEDBIZOPS for further updated information. NOTE! See Change in resonse date. Please note the following minutes from the industry forum and list of attendees. Meeting Minutes Industry Forum / Site Visit Replace Family Housing Phase 4 & 5, Ellsworth AFB, SD Sol. No. W9128F-06-R-0007 Date: May 9, 2006 Time: 0900 Location: Education Center Ellsworth AFB, SD Attendees: See Below The Industry Forum conference commenced at 9:00 a.m. with a project overview and a question and answer session. At approximately 11:00 a.m. the attendees were shown a vacant housing unit that is scheduled to be demolished in this project. Attendees were ca utioned that the written requirements of the solicitation take precedence over verbal communications of the conference/site visit. Minutes are as follows: INTRODUCTIONS:   All parties in attendance introduced themselves and the organization they represented.   An attendance roster was distributed for everyone in attendance to sign. A copy of the attendance roster is included below.   Index cards were distributed for Contractors to submit any formal questions. However, no formal questions were submitted. See Contractor Questions and Answers for discussion items that were made during the meeting.   It was noted that anything stated in the Industry Forum was not contractually binding and that the written RFP provides the formal contractual requirements. STATUS OF ELLSWORTH HOUSING:   Larry Herges from Ellsworths Base Civil Engineering Office (28 CES) gave a brief overview of the Ellsworth Housing history and the future work that remains to be done. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:   This solicitation is for a stand alone design / build RFP. It is a fixed price contract.   The scope of work for this RFP is as follows: Phase 4 (FY 05): 75 new housing units including: 25 JNCO 4-Bedroom units, 14 SNCO 4-Bedroom units, 22 CGO 4-Bedroom units, 7 E9 3 bedroom units, 4 E9 4 Bedroom units, and 3 SO 4 Bedroom units. There are handicap adaptable units for the JNCO 4BR, CGO 4BR, E 9 4BR, and all 3 of the SO units. An error on the current bid schedule was identified where a single E9-4BR handicap adaptable (ADA) unit was inadvertently omitted. The JNCO and SNCO/CGO units shall be in duplex configuration with E9 and SO units in single  family units. There are 102 existing housing units to be demolished and 110 units that have previously been removed but still have the excavation that needs to be filled in and utilities that need to be removed. Housing units shall be designed to match th e concept floor plans and elevations and the concept site plans shown in the RFP Drawings. The Contractors shall base their proposal on the RFP plans with minor adjustments, as necessary and as described in the RFP, during the design stage. There is an alt ernate proposal in the planning stages to allow 4-Plex Townhouses for all the JNCO 4 Bedroom units as well. These would be horizontal 4-Plex townhouses with 2 hr fire rated, structurally independent party walls between each unit.  Phase 5 (FY 06): 60 new h ousing units that are all JNCO 4 Bedroom units in duplex configuration. There are 116 existing housing units to be demolished. Housing units shall be designed to match the concept floor plans and elevations and the  concept site plans shown in the RFP Drawings. The Contractors shall base their proposal on the RFP plans with minor adjustments, as necessary and as described in the RFP, during the design stage. There is an alternate proposal in the planning stages to al low 4-Plex Townhouses for all the JNCO 4 Bedroom units as well. These would be horizontal 4-Plex townhouses with 2 hr fire rated, structurally independent party walls between each unit.   The RFP concept site plans and the Pricing Schedule (00010) show an Area 1 and 2 for Phase 4 and an Area 3 and 4 for Phase 5. Area 1 and 3 is shown as the minimum scope requirement of 75% of the total scope for Phase 4 and Phase 5 respectively. The Gover nment cannot make an award of a contract for less than 75% of scope without a reprogramming effort. Area 2 and Area 4 is the remainder of the housing units. The intent is to award a contract for the minimum scope plus any additional units in Area 2 (Ph 4) & Area 4 (Ph 5) that can be afforded within the Construction Cost Limitation (CCL).   The location of the Phase 4 & 5 work is shown on the referenced Demo, Site, & Utility Plans in the RFP. All utilities including Water, Sanitary, Gas, Electrical, Telephone, & Cable T.V. are to be replaced as shown on the RFP Drawings. Streets are to be r eplaced and widened in areas indicated on the RFP drawings with new curb and gutter. The utilities are typically located under the streets in an effort to preserve as many trees as possible. No playgrounds are required to be replaced but existing playgroun ds need to be protected and reutilized.   Reference Section 01000, Parts 1 through 14, for specific design and material requirements.  CONTRACT CHARACTERISTICS & PROPOSAL EVALUATION :   This solicitation is a One Phase Acquisition where the Contractors will submit one complete proposal that will be evaluated and a contract awarded to the Contractor that provides the Best Value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to awar d without discussions or requesting revised proposals, so it is important that the proposals are complete and accurate.  The Government can establish a competitive range that does not include all competing firms and hold discussions and request revised pro posals from only those firms. Since the Government can award without discussions or establish a competitive range, it is recommended that the prime contractors submit their best proposal possible and not count on submitting revised proposals.   The current schedule is to advertise the solicitation by 25 May 06 with proposals due on 29 June 06 and award anticipated by late July or early August 06. However, due to a recent request by the Air Force for an alternative bid schedule to allow 4-plex t ownhouses for the JNCO 4 BR units, the schedule may be delayed. It is anticipated that a concept design for the 4-plex townhouses and an alternative site plan will be provided in the solicitation. The 4-plex townhouse is currently being developed by the Ai r Force. Congressional appropriation has been approved for this project so it appears that funding will be available when needed at the time of award.   Reference Section 00110 of the RFP for proposal requirements and evaluation criteria.   The Proposal shall contain 3 separate volumes. Volume 1 contains 5 tabs including: Tab 1 Contractual Documents, Tab 2 Experience (Construction & Design), Tab 3 Past Performance (Construction and Design), Tab 4 Project Management, and Tab 5 Utilization of  Small Business. Volume II contains one tab, Tab 6 Design (Housing & Site). Volume III includes the Price Proposals with the SF 1442 and Section 00010 information. The evaluation factors will be weighted as follows in descending order of importance, except  that Tab 2 and Tab 3 shall be of equal weight: Tab 2, Tab 3, Tab 6, Tab 4, and Tab 5. Tabs 2 through 6, taken as a whole, are approximately equal to the importance of the Price Proposal. However, there are on-going discussions that may r evise the importance and order of these Tabs.   An adjectival rating system will be used in the evaluation (i.e., Exceptional, Above Average, Average, Marginal, and Unacceptable). The Army is prohibited from assigning numeric weights such as points or percentages to evaluations.   Tab 2 Experience (Construction & Design) evaluates the Contractors and Designers experience with: Similar Housing projects, Design / Build, Military Construction, and Similar Climate experience. Tab 3 Past Performance (Construction & Design) will evaluate the Contractors and Designers past performance on both Government and Private I ndustry experience within the past 5 years.   Tab 4 Project Management will evaluate the Contractors Project Management Plan (PMP), Construction and Design Personnel, Project Schedule, and Health & Safety Record. The PMP should address all pertinent information to illustrate that the Contractor has  a formal plan to handle the specific situations that this project will create such as: designer / constructor relationship, schedule adherence on design and construction, phased turnover, prototype construction, limited local labor resources, weather conc erns, quality control, etc. Resumes shall be submitted in the proposal for the PM, Superintendent, CQC, and all of the main design team members as indicated in the RFP. The proposed Project Schedule will be evaluated based on the how it compares to the max imum allowable schedule (for design and construction) of 660 days for the entire Phase 4 & 5 project. We are asking the Contractors whether they believe this is a reasonable amount of time to construct this entire project.  Refer to Section 00800, Paragrap h 1.2 for a liquidated damages schedule that will be based on a specific number of units turned over by a specific percentage of the scheduled time (i.e. 20% of units @ 60% of Schedule, 40% @ 70%, 60% @ 80%, 80% @ 90%, and 100% of units turned over @ 100% completion of schedule. The approved schedule will become a contractual obligation with LDs assessed as necessary. It is anticipated that the units will be turned over in areas as the Contractor finishes and moves the security fence to allow tenants to mov e in from on-base. The Contractor must maintain access on Washington Avenue for existing tenants in the Phase 3 Area to access their homes. The Health & Safety Record will evaluate incident rates from the past 5 years.   Tab 5 Utilization of Small Business Concerns contains four subfactors as follows: - Subcontracting goals: recommended percentages stated in solicitation; - Mitigation efforts: how the prime contractor will help SBs get a piece of the action; - Utilization and participation of small business concerns: identify small business team members, suppliers, etc.; If you dont know who will be the subs/suppliers, describe procurement practices, set-asides, etc. - Past performance in utilization of small business concerns: Demonstrate the extent to which applicable small business goals have been met or exceeded in past contracts.   Tab 6 Design (Housing & site) currently includes providing supporting data for 5 select items (Foundation System, Windows, Party Wall Construction, Furnace & A/C Equipment, and Durability & Efficiency). There have been recent discussions allowing up to 7  items total so we may be revising or adding a few more to the list. This information will include a write-up or description of the system, product literature, catalog cut sheets, etc. for each item. Since the Contractors are now required to base their pro posal on the RFP concept floor plans, elevations, and site plans, there is not a requirement for the Contractors to submit proposed concept housing designs or site designs.   The Construction Cost Limitation for Phase 4 is $18,900,000 and for Phase 5 it is $13,300,000. The CCL includes all design, design review, and construction costs for the project. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposals that exceed the se given cost limitations. Area 1 is shown as the minimum scope requirement of 75% of the total Phase 4 scope (57 units). Area 3 is shown as the minimum scope requirement of 75% of the total Phase 5 scope (46 units). The Government cannot make an award of a contract for less than 75% of scope on either Phase 4 or Phase 5 without a reprogramming effort. There are 2 Pricing Schedules to fill out. Pricing Schedule I is the total scope that is to be filled out for the Government to evaluate the cost of the tota l project scope. Pricing Schedule II shall be filled out to indicate at least the minimum scope (Area 1 for Phase 4 and Area 3 for Phase 5) and then fill out the pricing schedules for Area 2 (Phase 4) and Area 4 (Phase 5) with as many units as can be built  within the Construction Cost Limitation (CCL) as noted above for each Phase. Pricing Schedule II will be used for evaluation purposes to determine the Best Value to the Government with the Price being evaluated approximately equal to the total of Tabs 2-6 .   It was noted that proposals should be prepared that meet the RFP requirements with any deviations, and associated cost savings, identified separately in the proposal.   Performance & Payment bonds are required.   Evaluation of proposals and potential revised proposals will take several weeks. Inquiries for status should be directed to COE Contracting Division (Mel Vogt or Phillip Holman). No other Government personnel are permitted to respond to inquiries during the evaluation process. DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:   Reference Section 01332 of the RFP for Design Requirements.   Concept site plans are provided in the RFP drawings to show how the proposed concept plans will fit on the site with a general site and utility layout to serve the housing units. The Site plan can be adjusted, as necessary, during the design stages.   Copies of the AutoCad CDs of the RFP Drawings will be made available to the awarded Contractor to support the preparation of the design.   English will be used, not metric.   Designer can split out site and foundation design to expedite work effort. However, a set of For Construction drawings must ultimately be completed and received before NTP is typically issued for a particular area of work. Typically, the first review i s 100% Site and 60% Housing Design with the second review being a Back Check (100%) Site and 100% Housing Design with review conferences at Ellsworth AFB, SD.   Government requires a 20 day review time for each design submittal. PROJNET will be used for coordinating design review comments & responses. CONTRACTOR QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:   Index cards were distributed for Contractors to submit any formal questions. However, no formal questions were submitted. A few comments and concerns that were made in the meeting are as follows.   A question was asked about the Architect being required to be LEED certified. It was agreed that this requirement would be investigated and removed, if necessary. After the meeting, it was discovered that this requirement had already been taken out of th e Draft RFP requirements.   A question was asked about requirements for Contractors to have military housing experience with the concern that most local Contractors would not have much military housing experience. It was agreed to investigate this requirement and revise as necessar y. After the meeting, it was noted that the RFP does not specifically require that Contractors to have Military Housing Experience. The RFP requires construction experience for similar housing projects (No mention of it being Military Housing), design-buil d construction, military construction (No mention of it being Military Housing), and similar climate construction is to be submitted and evaluated. Additional edits will be made to the RFP to clarify the intent.   A question was posed to the Industry on what they believe the optimum construction duration should be for this project. The RFP requires that the Contractor pr opose their own schedule but uses a 660 day duration as a measure for evaluation purposes. A request was made to the industry to provide any input on this subject directly to John Stobbe.   A question was posed to the Industry on whether they would rather submit all the major product and material data sheets in their proposal or to not submit any at all. The previous housing RFP asked for all the major material information. This Draft RFP o nly requires that 5 items be submitted in their proposal. There was mixed reaction from the audience where some indicated that they would rather get concurrence from the Government that all their major proposed products and materials meet the RFP and other s that would rather submit that information as part of their design after the contract award. No formal agreement was made.  Currently the Air Force is planning to require that only 5 to 7 specific items be submitted for evaluation in the proposal with a p ass / fail evaluation as to whether they meet the RFP requirements.   A concern was made about the over-excavation requirements in this RFP with 4 of a specific select fill material to be used under all foundations and floor slabs. There was a concern that this requirement substantially increases the cost of the housing u nits. It was agreed that the Government would look at these requirements and make revisions if deemed necessary.   It was noted that the Buy American Act is required to be followed in this contract. It was noted that we have recently had problems meeting the Buy American Act on other housing project with several products such as carbon monoxide detectors, fluorescent  lamps, ceiling fans with light kits, door chimes, chrome plated, zinc die cast residential grade bath accessories, etc. where we will most likely allow specific exceptions in the RFP.

<DESC>Note:  The solicitation is posted on the Army Single Site to Industry as W912DY06T0018.  This site does not allow dashes.  The Closing Date has changed to 7 Aug 2006.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Center intends to award this requirem ent as an 8a small business set-aside - Native American.  This course provides insight into Native American beliefs and values that can enhance Corps or Federal management effectiveness and help provide leadership necessary for organizations to succeed. Th e workshop will allow the Tribe to explain their cultural values, attitudes, assumptions, and expectations as these issues relate to their Tribal beliefs concerning natural and cultural resources.  This course serves two primary purposes. The first purpose  is the need to develop principles and values necessary to evaluate Federal agency actions in light of sustainability and environmental concerns. The second purpose is to allow tribes and tribal members to share their knowledge and experience of sustainabl e living, and develop a better understanding of their cultural, spiritual, and environmental beliefs so Federal agencies can more effectively accomplish the trust/governmental responsibilities associated with Native Americans. It is anticipated that a firm  fixed price award will be executed in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.  One base year is contemplated.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement as a competitive small business 8a requirement for Native Amer icans.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and submit a proposal.  Any proposed course should currently exist in the commercial market place and meet the requirements herein.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV requires professional expertise and services to test a surfactant-based sampler for ultra fine particle bioassay using dynameter-controlled diesel engine exhaust.  The contractor shall provide test facilities and have primary responsibility for the performance of a field test of the physical performance of the device on the exhaust steam from a heavy-duty vehicle diesel operated on a chassis dynamometer under controlled laboratory test conditions.  The contractor shall provide the necessary facilities for the test including the vehicle engine, dynamometer test bed, exhaust dilution system of the exhaust stream as performed for emissions testing, sampling and particle size distribution analysis systems for the diluted exhaust stream; and integration of the conditioned and characterized exhaust stream with the surfactant sample.  The sampler will include use of a humidification pre-conditioner separately provided, to permit efficient impinger collection of hydrated nano-particulate material in the exhaust stream with subsequent capture of so-conditioned DPM into an impinger containing surrogate lung surfactant as the collection medium.  The contractor shall perform the test of the surfactant sampler, measuring the mass efficiency of the sampler collection for fine and ultra fine particle size ranges.  The surfactant sampler device is designed to preserve exhaust particulate nano-scale properties so as to permit short-term bioassays to address factors what may affect DPM genotoxic activity, e.g., associated with nano-aerosol fogs possibly generated by new Nox and PM controls for diesel exhaust.  Such surfactant-mediated sampling under conditions modeling DPM deposition in the deep lung is to permit subsequent physiologically meaningful toxicological bioassays of collected materials that can be obtained in the short-term but that are suitable for guiding longer-term animal inhalation studies and for detailing specific engine and control system design and operational factors affecting exhaust DPM toxicity.  The government intends to negotiate with West Virginia University as the only responsible source that will satisfy agency requirements.  Dr. Mridul Gautam has unique knowledge and experience with the device having co-designed it and having participated in a field feasibility study of the operation of the device.  He directs the Mobile Engine Emissions Test Laboratory of West Virginia University and makes available their mobile diesel engine dynamometer test stand and exhaust emissions sampling and characterization facility.  No solicitation is available; however, interested parties may request a copy of the Statement of Work including deliverables.

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to:  Rebecca Mullenax, Reference: # 000HCC34-2006-34280, DHHS, PHS, CDC, NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505 or RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV or fax to 304-285-6083.  

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could perform the effort.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with West Virginia University Research Corporation as the only source and a purchase order will be order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Narrowband and FM Transmitter Replacement for EC130-J PSYOPS Platform
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-HBTX01
<RESPDATE>072406

<CONTACT>Kelly Chism, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-757-9735, Fax null, Email Kelly.Chism@navy.mil - Benjamin Hansford, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 757-9742, Fax (301) 757-9046, Email benjamin.hansford@navy.mil
<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Division, is seeking vendors to provide options on how best to meet the EC-130J Airborne Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) 1 kilowatt Narrowband (NB) and FM analog broadcast mission.  The Government is seeking identification of any appreciable increases in technical capability in the marketplace since the last NB and FM request for proposals for the Modular Commando Solo PSYOPS program which occurred approximately two years ago.  For this case, technical capability increases are identified as any combination of increases in power efficiency, reduction in weight, reduction in volume, or reduction in cost.

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine the best value solution for complete replacement and enhancement to simultaneous NB/FM of the existing NB-only mission system.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond with recommendations and capability statements.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.

CURRENT SYSTEM:
The current NB system is composed of two VHF Low 1 kilowatt (KW) transmitters (30 MHz – 230 MHz), two VHF High 1 KW transmitters (100 MHz – 500 MHz), and one UHF 1 KW transmitter (470 MHz – 1000 MHz).  The current VHF Low and UHF 1 KW transmitters can also be utilized as TV drivers to support the 10 kilowatt TV mission; however, a new separate, dedicated TV driver is planned for utilization as part of the upgrade effort to prevent reducing the NB mission broadcast options when supporting the TV mission broadcast.  Broadcasts in the commercial FM radio frequency band are currently generated by modulating the VHF Low and/or VHF High transmitters with FM baseband sources.  A dedicated 4-source FM transmitter system is also planned for utilization to prevent reducing the NB mission broadcast options whenever supporting the commercial FM radio broadcast.

BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS:
The requirement for supporting the existing NB mission is driven by the VSWR and bandwidth limitations of the NB antennas.

A.	VHF Low NB antennas:  30 MHz – 150 MHz and maximum VSWR of 2:1,

B.	VHF High NB antennas: 100 MHz – 500 MHz and a maximum VSWR of 2:1, 

C.	UHF NB antennas: 500 MHz – 1000 MHz and a maximum VSWR of 2:1, and

D.	Commercial FM (87.5 MHz – 108 MHz).

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.               

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.     The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).     This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

To build upon the objectives of the NIAID Genomics programs (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/genomes/) and address the Institute’s need to further expand the knowledge of the proteome, NIAID is looking to establish 2 large scale Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases that will apply state-of-the art high-throughput (HTP) structural biology technologies to experimentally characterize the three dimensional atomic structure of targeted proteins from pathogens in the NIAID Category A-C priority lists (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm) and organisms causing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The scope of the Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases is to create a collection of high quality, experimentally determined three-dimensional structures that is widely available to the scientific community and serves as a blueprint for development of structure-based drugs, vaccines and diagnostics for infectious diseases. The three dimensional structure of proteins can assist drug design and development by yielding direct insights into the target molecular mechanisms, in interaction with other biological molecules, or with synthetic compounds, in order to improve selectivity, specificity and optimize drug development in a rational way.  

The primary focus of the Structural Genomics Centers shall be pathogen targets that are expected to have an important biological role and a potential impact on biomedical research, such as: 

Proteins involved in pathogenesis, such as invasins, adhesions, toxins;

Proteins essential to the pathogen’s life and reproductive cycle;

Proteins involved in antimicrobial/drug resistance;

Protein markers of acute or chronic infection;

Complexes with natural substrates, cofactors, receptors, drug candidates;

Protein splice variants, post-translational modifications and other functionally characterized variants.

HTP structure determination is a complex scientific and technical process that includes target selection, cloning, expression and purification, sample preparation for X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray and NMR data collection, structure solution and validation. Pathogen targets shall be proposed by external investigators, NIH, other Government agencies, and the Contractor. The Contractor is expected to provide NIAID with established operational facilities, infrastructure, and scientific and technical expertise to perform in a HTP manner every component of the protein structure determination process. 

The Center shall provide to the broad scientific community by making available its technologies, resources and staff expertise to determine the structure of targets and deposit that information into the public domain. The Center must maintain productivity, quality and costs for structure determination that are competitive with those of similar HTP Structural Genomics Centers,  such as the Large-Scale Centers funded by the NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) under the second phase of the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI-2) http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Initiatives/PSI/. NIAID is committed to release into the public domain the results of the structural genomics projects in a timely fashion. It is anticipated that the Contractor will follow the guidelines established by the NIGMS-PSI large scale Centers for structural genomics. Those guidelines currently state that the atomic coordinates of the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules and associated data shall be deposited and released into the public domain within 4 weeks from completion of the structure determination project.

The Government anticipates multiple awards.  It is anticipated that the duration of the contracts will be a maximum of five (5) years; however, the length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  

Small business and 8(a) contractors are reminded that in order to quality as a set-aside, 51% of the direct labor must be performed by the prime contractor.  It is anticipated that an anticipated total effort of approximately 29.75 FTEs will be needed to accomplish this project. Interested organizations should submit three (3) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Interested organizations presenting a capability statement in response to this sources sought announcement must identify their size status.  Written capability statements should be received by the NIAID Contracting Officer by July 21, 2006.  Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls or facsimiles will be accepted. E-mail transmissions will be accepted.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  See Government-wide numbered note 25.

<SOLNBR>W9113M-06-R-0TBD
<RESPDATE>071706
<ARCHDATE>09152006
<CONTACT>Christopher Evans, 256-955-5878
<DESC>This special announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in the Product Manager-Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS), Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System-IV (ICIDS-IV) follow-on pro curement at the prime contractor level; and (2) to accurately gauge the capability of those interested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level.  The briefings and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do N OT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm's or team's ability to perform; however, these will be utilized to make a final decision concerning set-aside.  The responses to this notice are for Government planning purposes only and shall not be construed a s a definitive intent to proceed with this acquisition.  At this time, the Government does not intend to award more than one contract.  Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, providing that each team member meets the North American Industry Clas sification System (NAICS) code small business size standard and are deemed capable.    The current Small Business Administrative (SBA) rules allow a set-aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small business teams when at least 50% of the effort will be performed by the collective efforts of all small busine ss members of the team.  The current SBA 8(a) affiliation rules allow joint ventures or teams when the 8(a) concern performs a significant amount of the work with its own employees and the size of at least one 8(a) participant to the joint venture is less than one half the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract.  Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA.  A Service-Disabled Veteran Owned-Small Business Concern (SDVO-SBC) prime contractor can subc ontract part of a SDVO contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or on the employees of other SDVO-SBCs.  A joint venture of at least one SDVO-SBC and one or more other b usiness concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a competitive SDVO-SBC procurement so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract.  A qualified Historically Underutilized Business (HUBZone) SBC pri me contractor can subcontract part of a HUBZone contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or on the employees of other qualified HUBZone SBCs.   A joint venture of tw o or more qualified HUBZone SBCs may submit an offer for a HUBZone contract so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract.  The joint venture itself need not be certified as a qualified HUBZone.  Further infor mation regarding teaming and joint ventures are located in the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR 124 and 125).   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561621 with a small business standard of $11.5M.   This acquisition will result in multiple Task Orders (T/Os) with site specific Statements of Work (SOWs).  The T/O's will consist of fixed-price labor and material categories and cost reimbursable travel in accordance with (IAW) Department of Defense (DOD)  Joint Travel Regulations (JTR).   The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other  proposing teams).   Any small business firms, including 8(a), HUBZone, SDVO, or Woman-Owned firms, intending to propose as a prime contractor (especially those planning to use the affiliation and teaming rules issued by the SBA) are invited to  give a briefing at Fort Belvoir, VA, on technical capability (limited to one hour).  Interested firms should submit within 10 calendar days after the date of this announcement an email stating your intent to present such a briefing to the Government to Ch ris Evans at christopher.evans@smdc.army.mil (title email - ICIDS-IV Capability Briefing).  Large business requests for capability briefing opportunities as a prime contractor are not desired at this time.  Capability briefings must mirror how you plan to propose.  If proposing as a team, the briefings must reflect the team and team approach. To be considered in this determination, the capability briefings will be due not later than 4 August 2006.  Capability Briefing date/time will be scheduled after receipt of intent emails discussed above.   The briefings shall clearly describe the Offeror's proven abilities to overcome the challenges of the ICIDS-IV program (i.e. experience, training, certification,).   Some of the noted challenges include: The ability to provide National Agency Check (NAC) cleared, original equipment manufacture (OEM) system certified, properly skilled and experienced personnel to conduct site surveys, site specific designs, and installation in accordance with the applicable  regulations at Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) Installations executing simultaneously.  A fully integrated installation can represent a geographical area of several hundred square miles and may include over  one hundred buildings of various form, configuration, and function requiring multiple levels of security and asset protection phenomenologies. ICIDS systems management involves complex life-cycle software maintenance.  This includes as a minimum software architecture design, regression analysis and testing skills and configuration management procedures to be utilized throughout the life cycle of the program.  This is a critical function to maintain the integrity of the system and subsequently maintaining the level of protection required by the regulations mentioned above.  Since the system is based on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products, the Offeror must be able to react to obsolescence and security enhancement issues that arise from government regulation evolutions and significant commercial market pressures.  The Successful Offeror may be required to procure materials and sustain on-going installations with their own capital during performance of completion-type task orders.  A significant capital investment may be required as each installation could average $3 M with up to 15 sites being executed simultaneously.   The briefings must focus on past experience and shall demonstrate the prime and/or teams ability to successfully perform the anticipated contract considering the challenges to:  (1) concurrently manage a minimum of 15 site-specific Intrusion Detection System (IDS) surveys, designs, installations, tests, training, and interim support at overseas and domestic locations that meet stringent security, chemical and biological surety, am munition and explosive safety, and information protection regulations;   (2) fiscally support these simultaneous efforts with each site averaging $3M in resources;  (3)  meet and obtain Information Assurance (IA) DoD Information Technology Security Certification & Accreditation Process (DITSCAP);  (4) quickly ramp up qualified, trained, experienced personnel at the onset of the contract;  (5) administer and manage an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract (expected to be as much as $250M including options) with numerous subcontractors and/or partners;  (6) perform realistic cost and schedule projections for complex technical and integration efforts;  (7) create a contract management structure that allows for an integrated organization accountable for total performance responsibility;  (8) apply an established understandi ng of DoD, Army, and Federal Government Agencies, their policies, regulations, and procedures;  (9) ensure that the small business firm or small business team will perform at least 50% of the work; and (10) pull together a team that is fully capable of proposing and performing without any organizational conflict of interest (OCI) restrictions. The government reserves the right to verify any information provided in the briefings.  Any pertinent customer contact information shall be made available upon request. This acquisition is not open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  In order to be considered for award IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.204-2 (8/96), Security Requirements, the Contractor shall compl y with the security regulations and procedures set forth in the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) and DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Guide, included in the solicitation and resultant contract.  Before performing and upon completion of any on-site work, the Contractor shall report to the Installation Security Officer or the designated representative.  Contractor personnel shall possess and transmit appropriate clearances prior to arrival at the site.  Pursuant to A R 190-11 and AR 190-13, Contractor personnel whose duties involve the design, operation, test, installation, or maintenance of unclassified Intrusion Detection Systems require completion of a favorable NAC or NAC with written inquiries prior to appointment  to such non-critical, sensitive positions.

<DESC>GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION
SPONSORS
PRIVATE SECTOR REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY CONFERENCE


U.S. GOVERNMENT is sponsoring an Industry Conference for all Real Estate Colleagues in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge Market areas to introduce the Advanced Acquisition Program.
EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST REGISTRATION PERIOD OPEN 7/10/2006 – 7/21/2006

CONFERENCE SUBJECT:

The Advanced Acquisition Program (AAP) is a monthly opportunity for offering building space for lease to the Federal Government.  GSA has streamlined the lease acquisition process in the Greater Southwest Regions markets through utilization of this program.    

You are invited to participate in a General Services Administration (GSA) sponsored industry conference to introduce the Advanced Acquisition Program (AAP).  The conference is scheduled for Tuesday, July 25, 2006 from 1:00 P.M. until 4:00 P.M at the Astor Crowne Plaza Hotel, New Orleans, Louisiana.   The purpose of the conference is to introduce the Advanced Acquisition Program and solicit input from real estate firms interested in offering space to the government through this automated offering system.  

AAP is a standardized multiple award platform that will be utilized in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge markets for award of future GSA lease acquisition space needs.  GSA has explored the markets within the Region 7 boundaries as well as special emergency management program needs where the AAP program would provide the streamlined acquisition process needed.  The New Orleans and Baton Rouge markets have been identified as two of the markets where GSA will implement the AAP and it is the government's intent to utilize the AAP program for all lease contract awards that fit within the program's parameters.   Topics to be discussed at the conference are, 1) History of the Advanced Acquisition Program, 2) How will the program work, and 3) What advantage does it provide the Private Sector.  

We are interested in your ideas and experience in leasing to the government and input on how this program can best be utilized in the San Antonio market areas.  Please keep in mind that we are trying to be responsive to what your industry’s needs are in deciding how to best streamline the lease acquisition process and encourage competition.  Our goal is to get the best people in the industry, at the best price, to work with us.  You don’t have to prepare anything for this meeting; just bring your ideas and experience.  Please do not bring marketing materials or any written proposals.   

If you have any questions, please contact Mary Pesina, Program Manager, at (817) 978- 3577 or you may register for the conference by sending an email to Mary Pesina at mary.pesina@gsa.gov.

HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair 
and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was 
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and 
time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is 
empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General 
Accounting Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast 
Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest 
with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their 
concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or 
Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast 
Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to 
the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the 
concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for 
Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend 
contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time 
requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a 
timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the 
Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and 
solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency 
protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the 
contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are 
unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, 
the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be 
suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in 
writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best 
interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 
calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at 
FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling 
of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within 
the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program 
should be forwarded to the address below:

Description
The Library of Congress intends to purchase through sole source from Costec Analytical Technologies Inc., 26074 Ave. Hall, Suite 14, Valencia, CA 91355, an ECS 4010 Elemental Combustion System, with a 50-position autosampler carousel, WindowsTM-based data acquisition software, and a Sartorius CP2P Microbalance with 1-microgram readability that will be used for research and routine testing of a broad range of Library collection materials, collection housing materials, and collection environments.  It is the Library’s understanding that the identified instrument system is the only one commercially available in the U.S. that is capable of meeting the Library’s critical performance requirement for an elemental analysis  system that also meets the following needs:  It must be a research-grade instrument that can provide for both micro- (< 1-5 mg), semi-micro (5-10 mg), and macro- (up to 50 mg) analyses in one instrument, with all analyses under software control; It must utilize both combustion/chromatographic and multi-detector methods, in which the user can software-select a combination of different combustion methods and connect the chromatographic output to different detectors; Detectors must include a thermal conductivity detector for general chromatographic analysis so that all combustion products are measured, and the chromatographic output must be easy to interface to and be controlled by an external mass spectrometer and data system for conducting stable isotope analysis; It must be capable of using multiple combustion and reaction tubes (size range from 10-30 mm OD) and the pneumatics must allow for easy switch between micro-, semi-micro-, and macro-analyses; It must have at a minimum a 32-bit A/D interface with the ability to upgrade to interface boards for 4 channels for use of 4 detectors simultaneously; It must have an autosampler with at least a 50-position carousel and the ability to upgrade to a purged autosampler to prevent contamination of samples with atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen; It must come with a sophisticated microbalance with 1-microgram readability; It must have a computer and data system that operates under Windows XP.  Any other company that, at the time of application, (1) is either legally incorporated as a U.S. business entity or capable of demonstrating through its business plan its intention to be fully incorporated as a U.S. business, and (2) believes its elemental analysis system can meet all the above equipment performance requirements can apply to the Library for consideration.

<DESC>Purchase of a Pyrolysis Unit for Gas Chromatography

The Library of Congress intends to purchase through sole source from CDS Analytical, Inc., P.O. Box 277,Oxford, PA , 19363-0277, a Pyroprobe 5150 Pyrolyzer with programmable interface, that will be used for research and routine characterization of the chemical components of a broad range of Library collection materials and collection housing materials.  It is the Library’s understanding that the identified instrument system is the only one commercially available in the U.S. that is capable of meeting the Library’s critical performance requirement for a pyrolysis unit for gas chromatography that also meets the following needs:  It must be compatible with any make and model of gas chromatograph (GC); it must include a heated GC interface with variable temperature programming with the pyrolyzer using a platinum filament for variable temperature control, either of coil or ribbon type contained in a user-replaceable probe rod that is user replaceable and factory calibrated to ensure temperature repeatability within +/- 1 °C; the pyrolyzer must provide for direct analysis of samples either on the ribbon filament or in quartz tubes that will fit directly inside the coil filament; the temperature and heating rate of the pyrolyzer filaments must be programmable from ambient to 1400 °C, programmable in 1 °C increments, with user-selectable heating rates of 0.01 °C/min to 20.0 °C/msec; the pyrolyzer must have a built-in “low-mass” type heated interface for transfer of pyrolysis products to the GC that can allow for either non-isothermal or programmable operation in 1 °C increments to 350 °C with the interface connected through a heated sample line into the injection port of the GC allowing quick removal and switching to another GC; temperature programming of both the pyrolysis robe and the GC interface must allow for at least eight multiple ramping steps that will include initial temperature, ramp, and final temperature with separate GC runs for each ramping step; the instrument must have three modes of operation, with one used for analyzing samples by pyrolysis, one for cleaning non-volatile residues from the heating element and quartz tubes by heating the coil to 1200 °C for 5 seconds, and one for allowing for evaporation of solvents used to dissolve the sample before pyrolysis; the pyrolysis unit must be software programmable from a Windows-based PC and allow for the remote start of the GC through the pyrolyzer and for the storage of an unlimited number of analytical methods; the pyrolysis unit must be capable of interfacing directly to a sample concentrator device to allow for maximum flexibility in the analysis; and the pyrolyzer must be provided by a supplier having local service support and stocking of spare parts, with the supplier providing installation, start-up assistance, and on-site training.  Any other company that, at the time of application, (1) is either legally incorporated as a U.S. business entity or capable of demonstrating through its business plan its intention to be fully incorporated as a U.S. business, and (2) believes its elemental analysis system can meet all the above equipment performance requirements can apply to the Library for consideration.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation with additional information included in this notice.  The requiring office is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Canine Training and Operations Support Branch.  This branch trains canines to detect accelerant and explosives for State, Local, and other Federal and foreign law enforcement agencies.  The Accelerant Detection Canine Program places accelerant detection canines with State and local law enforcement and fire service agencies to support their arson investigation activities.  The Explosives Detection Canine Program was initiated through an agreement with the Department of State to train explosives detection canines to be used overseas in the war against terrorism.  In addition, the Explosives Detection Canine Program trains explosives detection canines for Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.  ATF is contracting for a skilled technician with specialized knowledge and ability in the care, safe handling, and health management of canines.  The ATF canines are housed at the ATF Canine Center located in Front Royal, Virginia.  The contractor employee will work at the ATF Canine Center in Front Royal, Virginia.  The workforce at the Center is composed of six canine technicians and a canine center supervisor who are responsible for the care and health of approximately 45-70 canines.  The contractor employee will supplement the work of six canine technicians.  The contractor employee must adhere to the following requirements: 1) possess a valid State driver’s license to transport canines to veterinary clinics; 2) not violate the Code of Virginia Title 3.1, Chapter 27.4, Article 6; Warren County, VA Code 66-6; and Town of Front Royal, VA Municipal Code 66-4; 3) follow all established guidelines and procedures set by ATF, the Canine Center supervisor and the Branch Chief; 4) have knowledge of the manual labor tasks relative to the maintenance of a large kennel facility and experience in working with a veterinary in the proper care and health management of canines; 5) work both indoors and outdoors during all types of weather and may be required to work in areas which are hot, cold, dusty, odorous, or with high humidity, as well as in closed areas and cramped spaces; 6) considerable walking, standing, heavy lifting of up to 100 pounds, stooping, and other types of physical effort and dexterity in moving and distributing canines, animal food, and equipment, and in opening and closing kennel doors and gates.

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Piezoelectric Materials Deposition Printer System.

***The contract line items (CLINS) for this procurement are:

 CLIN 0001: Piezoelectric Materials Deposition Printer System, Quantity:  1, Unit:  Each, which shall meet or exceed the following required specifications: 

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIN 0001:

Overview:

NIST has a critical need for a drop-on-demand custom inkjet printer system with a demonstrated ability for printing solutions of high explosives, narcotics and polymers. This system will be used to support a time critical research program to produce standard materials for calibration of trace explosive detection instruments currently undergoing widespread operational deployment at airports throughout the United States. 


Technical Specifications:

The printer is needed for precision delivery of isobutyl alcohol solutions of high explosives and narcotics and dilute solutions of polymers in dichloroethane. These solutions will be printed on a variety of substrates including sheets of paper, silicon wafers, glass slides and cloth. Minimum requirements for this system are listed below.

Mechanical/Stage Control: 

•	The print area must cover at least 8 x 11 inches. 

•	The stage travel in the vertical direction (z) must accommodate a sample with a maximum height of 2 inches. 

•	The sample stage shall have a mechanism to hold samples flat with the stage surface.

•	Temperature control of the sample stage is required to control evaporation rate of inkjet deposits.

•	Absolute positioning of the stage is required to allow droplet deposition onto selectable areas of various samples. The system shall be capable of delivering individual droplets within 25 micrometers of a predefined location (at room temperature). 

•	The printing area shall be fully enclosed to prevent outside contamination of the printed standards.



Software Control: 

•	Microsoft Windows compatible software is required for x,y, z stage positioning and control of the number of drops delivered. 

•	The control software must allow for input of user supplied printing arrays/patterns.

•	The software must allow the user complete control over the printing parameters including adjustment of all dispensing device waveform parameters.



Printing Modes/Specifications:

•	Print “on the fly” mode is required.

•	Piezoelectric based dispensor is required. 

•	NIST will be printing many different high explosive, narcotic and polymer standard solutions of various concentrations. To prevent cross-contamination between these solutions, it is required to have independent and disposable printhead cartridges for each solution.

•	High sample throughput is a critical requirement. A multiple printhead system is required with a minimum of 10 nozzles 

•	The system must be able to printing 100 by 100 spot arrays of a 3% polylactic acid polymer (Sigma Chemical Co) in 1,2-dichloroethane (Aldrich Chemical Co.,) on a standard glass slide.  
 
•	The system shall be capable of printing dilute explosives solutions in isobutanol.  For the purposes of this requirement demonstration of printing of pure isobutanol is sufficient. 

•	Because this system will be used to print NIST standard reference materials, any available documentation on repeatability of individual drop volume of the system should be provided by the vendor. Demonstrated variability in drop volume of less than 5% is required.  

•	A video camera system with strobe light illumination is required for visualization of inkdrop formation.

•	Due to the difficulty in reliably printing the required solutions, a tip cleaning cycle shall be integrated into printing cycle. 

•	A video camera for real time visualization of the substrate to be printed is required.

•	Droplet diameter for isobutanol solutions shall be 60 micrometers or less. 

Additional Specifications:

•	This is a time critical research project. Delivery to NIST is required within 60 days of PO acceptance by the Contractor.  CLIN 0001 SHALL BE OFFERED ON AN FOB DESTINATION BASIS ONLY.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT CONSIDER OFFERS ON ANY OTHER BASIS.  The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001.

•	Price must include on-site installation. Installation shall be within 2 weeks of delivery, Monday- Friday, 8:30 AM-5:00 PM in Bldg 222, Room A132 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. All necessary services (electrical, plumbing, ventilation) will be supplied by NIST.

•	The Contractor shall provide training for up to 4 people at NIST after the system is installed and accepted by NIST.  Training shall include, at a minimum, basic operation and maintenance of the system, as well as how to print for high explosives, narcotics and polymers.

*** The Government will not accept CLIN 0001 until after installation is completed and only if CLIN 0001 meets or exceeds all minimum specifications.***


EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1.     Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement

2.     Past performance information for similar contracts/orders completed within the past 3 years

3.     Evaluated Price for CLIN 0001

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is being competed on an unrestricted basis.  Therefore, all responsible parties may submit a quote.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Active Radioactive Materials (RAM) Waste Monitor.

***The contract line items (CLINS) for this procurement are:

 CLIN 0001: Active Radioactive Materials (RAM) Waste Monitor for measurement and clearance of potentially contaminated items, Quantity:  1, Unit:  Each, which shall meet or exceed the following required specifications: 

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIN 0001:
The monitor shall have a minimum capacity volume of 52 x 52 x 52 cm for clearing waste generated in the laboratory. The laboratory uses a variety of radiation sources, emission types, and energies including low energy X-ray (about 36 keV), high energy gamma (1.3 MeV) and moderate to high energy betas (50 keV to 1.7 MeV).  

Functional Requirements

The system shall consist of a minimum of 4 large area detectors to measure gamma emitting radionuclides, low energy X-ray, and high energy beta particles (presumably plastic scintilators). All of the detectors shall be arranged to maximize coverage of the interior surface of the chamber creating an approximately 4 pi detection geometry (at a minimum top, bottom, and sides). External background signal shall be suppressed by surrounding the detectors and counting chamber (top, bottom, sides, and door/s) with an amount of lead to shield the detectors from a typical background of about 50uR/hr. Additionally the system shall be able to actively monitor the background when not in use and apply this background subtraction to determine net counting results. All computer displays, electronics, controls, indicator lights, keyboard/pad, shall allow the user to control and monitor the system. Count cycles shall be initiated either by simply closing the door of by a simple push button. Monitor results with the date, time background, net count, and result of check “OK” or “Alarm” shall be displayed. The user interface shall allow the users to set detection, count cycle, and alarm parameters, perform QA and calibration functions, and select output formats. The unit shall include all ancillary items needed for full and complete turnkey operations including but not limited to: power cords, surge protectors, input key boards, output printers and cables, video displays, gas regulators (if required), transport carts, shielding, and detectors cables and tubing.

Detector Characteristics

The system shall utilize detectors capable of detecting contamination from high energy beta-, gamma-, and X-ray emitting radiation sources including: Cl-36, Fe-55/59,  
Ni-63, Sr-89/90, Y-90, Tc-99/m, Mo-99, I-125/129/131, Pd-103, Cd-109, Cs-137, P-32, Am-241, Pu-239, and U-238. The detectors shall employ plastic scintillators.  Solid state detectors or sealed proportional tubes would be an acceptable alternative, as long as they meet the same or better performance, detection, and background suppression specifications of detectors employing plastic scintillators with photomultiplier tubes.   

The system shall be capable of detecting and alarming for activities above 2 nanocuries with a counting time not greater than 20 minutes while operating in a moderate to low external background field up to 0.2 mR/hr.

The system shall be capable of operating in the temperature range of 5&#730;C to 40ºC (41ºF to 104ºF). The system shall meet performance requirements without fluctuation or adjustment in operating parameters for normal variations in laboratory environmental conditions with room temperature 15-32 degrees Celsius, and relative humidity 20-70 percent.

The system shall operate on standard AC power at 115 to 125 volts at 60 Hz. 

The instrument shall be self contained. The system (including computer display and output device) shall be capable of being moved by one individual, without disassembly or technical support from the manufacturer.

The internal lining and detectors shall be capable of being removed, cleaned, or replaced by NIST personnel without use of specialized tools unless such tools are provided with CLIN 0001. Detectors shall be replaceable or repairable by NIST personnel.

Count cycle times shall be variable and selectable by NIST staff ranging from 1 minute up to 15 minutes. (Alternatively count times may be adjusted automatically based on alarm set point – Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) and background algorithms). 

Monitor results shall report date, time, “Alarm”, “OK”, “Clear”, background value, and support units such as gross and net counts and/or count rates, measured activities in disintegration rates as reported in disintegrations per minute and/or SI units, and minimal detectable activities in the same units as measured activities (dps, Bq, or nanocuries). The “Alarm” and threshold shall be based on user-specified levels.

All system documentation, operation maintenance, repair manuals, and required software along with backup disks of the programs for reinstallation shall be included. A listing of all proprietary items, system requirements, current costs, and replacement lead times shall be included with the delivered documentation.


***Delivery shall be completed not later than 90 days after order acceptance.  CLIN 0001 SHALL BE OFFERED ON AN FOB DESTINATION BASIS ONLY.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT CONSIDER OFFERS ON ANY OTHER BASIS.  The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

CLIN 0002:  Within thirty (30) days of delivery, the Contractor shall provide a technical representative on site at NIST for setup and initial calibration of the unit. At that time, the technical representative shall provide NIST staff with training (a minimum 4 hours) on the setup, operations, QA, and maintenance of the unit. The technical representative shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the NIST COTR that the unit satisfies all aspects of the specifications in the purchase order.  If the Contractor is required to install the system, the cost of that service shall be included in CLIN 0002.***

*** The Government will not accept CLIN 0001 until after CLIN 0002 is completed and only if CLIN 0001 meets or exceeds all minimum specifications.***


EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1.     Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement

2.     Past performance information for similar contracts/orders completed within the past 3 years

3.     Evaluated Price for CLIN 0001

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment III under Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice for DJJ-CSREES-2006-013-01
is to extend the due date for quotes from July,17, 2006 to July 19, 2006 2:00PM EST. This extension is necessary because we have 
received a number of questions from interested parties. Provided herein are all of the Questions and Answers.

1.	Does the agency intend to make one award, or multiple awards, under the subject solicitation?
ANS.	There will be one award
2.	What specific facilities, supplies, reference materials, and equipment (stated under RFQ General Requirements, Item 1) are contemplated by the agency?
ANS.	The contractor shall provide a personal computer/workstation with Internet connection and reference materials (dictionaries, thesauri, taxonomic aids, etc.) at an offsite facility (number and location at contractor’s option). 
3.	As per RFQ General Requirement, Item 3, is the contractor’s selection of indexing terms for project summaries based on a controlled vocabulary such as a USDA supplied thesaurus?  If yes, please describe the controlled vocabulary source to be used.
ANS.	The current vocabulary is an alphabetized list based initially on the NAL Agricultural/Biological Vocabulary (1967). The vocabulary is semi-controlled with additions allowed with justification. The list of terms can be viewed/downloaded at http://cris.csrees.usda.gov/indsow/keylist.txt. (Note: The indexing authority may change to the NAL Thesaurus for the option years of the contract or sooner if feasible.)
4.  With respect to Medline Indexing, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) states that      an average indexer can index 4 documents per hour.  Based on the agency’s prior experience and data, what is the number of records that an average indexer can expect to index per hour?  Since this is a fixed price contract, one should reasonably expect the agency to have available such data.
ANS.	A batch of 450 documents to be completed within a three-week period equates to 3.75 documents per hour (assuming eight hours/day, five days/week). An experienced indexer should easily meet or exceed this rate.
5.	RFQ General Requirement, Item 4 refers to work performed by “contractor employees.”  Please confirm that the agency requires that contractor staff be full-time, or part-time employees as opposed to freelance staff.
ANS.	All work shall be done on a full time basis during Monday through Friday only.

6.	The notice states, in relevant part, that: [T]he contractor shall provide a microcomputer capable of connecting to the CRIS database through the Internet and compatible with the application software provided by the government.  Emphasis added.  Please clarify whether contractor staff perform online indexing (requiring multiple computers capable of connecting to the CRIS database through the Internet), or manual indexing which is then keyboarded and uploaded through the Internet.  The use of the phrase “a microcomputer” seems to imply manual indexing or a requirement for a single indexer.
ANS.	Indexer(s) connect directly to the application and enter all terms online. Multiple indexers can connect simultaneously.
7.	RFQ Specific Requirements, Item 1 states that the Government will provide project summaries in batches of three hundred (300) to four hundred and fifty (450) documents.  What is the agency’s requirement (or expectation) with respect to contractor turn-around-time for completion of a batch?
ANS.	The agency anticipates providing 450 documents for each three-week period. The contractor may request a temporary reduction (minimum of 300) if necessary.
8.	 What is the Government’s proposed schedule for providing three hundred (300) to four hundred and fifty (450) documents to the contractor (per week, every two weeks, one a month, irregular, etc.)?
ANS.	This was answered above, see item 4.
9.   RFQ Specific Requirements, Item 2 refers to Enclosures 1A/1B.  There are no such enclosures provided in the subject notice.  Please provide copies of Enclosures 1A/1B.
          ANS.	Enclosures 1A/1B (Forms AD-416/417) may be downloaded at http://cwf.umv.edu/cris/forms.htm.
10.	RFQ Specific Requirements, Item 2 states that classification codes are detailed in the Manual of Classification for Agricultural and Forestry Research, Education, and Extension, Revision VII provided by the government.  For indexing costing purposes, please provide a link to this document, or provide quantitative and substantive information concerning its contents to permit appropriate costing.  It is our understanding that prior contractors have had access to or an opportunity to examine this required publication.
ANS.   The Manual of Classification for Agricultural and Forestry Research, Education, and Extension, Rev VII may be viewed/downloaded at http://cris.csrees.usda.gov/star/manual.html.
11.	RFQ Specific Requirements, Item 3 refers to Enclosure 3, Indexing Procedures, and Indexing CRIS Projects Using STAR Client, provided by the Government at contract start, for details of the indexing process.  The Combined Solicitation notice provides no such enclosure.  It is our understanding that prior contractors have had access to or an opportunity to examine this required publication.
ANS.	Enclosure 3 (Indexing Procedures) is a one-page summary of the indexing process using the Cuadra STAR Client software. It can be viewed/downloaded at http://cris.csrees.usda.gov/indsow/indproc2006.pdf. The document, Indexing CRIS Projects Using STAR Client, is a more detailed description of the indexing process and will be provided at contract start. (Note: The indexing process may change to a browser-based interface with a planned change in the database platform. New documentation and/or training will be provided at that time.)
12.	RFQ Specific Requirements, Item 4 refers to “the current vocabulary file.”  As there is no antecedent reference to this phrase, please provide access to this file, or a complete detailed description and sample pages for costing purposes.  It is our understanding that prior contractors have had access to or an opportunity to examine this file.
ANS.	This is answered above in question 4
13.	RFQ Specific Requirements, Item 4 states that “[T]he contractor shall create and/or select new, provisional indexing terms...”  Does the Government intend to exercise any control or oversight with respect to the creation, selection, and use of such terms?  If yes, please describe the proposed process to insure that only Government approved indexing terms are used for indexing.  We ask this question because NLM does not allow new terms to be used unless approved in advance by a committee.
ANS.	A proposed new term with justification (along with the number of the associated record) must be submitted for approval by the COR or his designee. Terms not currently in the vocabulary will not be accepted by the software as indexing terms.
14.	If the contractor creates and uses a new indexing term, is the record containing that term subject to rejection if the agency in its discretion believes that it does not enhance retrieval of the project, or is not relevant to the subject of the project, or it believes that there is another existing term or combination of existing terms that will suffice as an index entry?  If yes, please provide more guidelines on use of new indexing terms for costing purposes.
ANS.	Evaluation of indexed records will be based only on the terms selected from the vocabulary. A proposed new term that is not accepted will not cause the associated record to be rejected.
15.	RFQ Specific Requirements, Item 5 refers to Enclosure 4, Sample STAR Client Screen Prints.  No such enclosure is provided in the Combine Solicitation notice.  Please provide.
ANS.	Sample STAR Client screen prints can be viewed/downloaded at http://cris.csrees.usda.gov/indsow/screenprints.pdf.
16.	RFQ Specific Requirements, Item 5 refers to STAR Client software provided by the government.  Please confirm that the STAR Client software is from Cuadra Associates.
ANS.	The STAR Client software is a product of Cuadra Associates.
17.	Under Government-Furnished Items Item A, the notice states that the Manual of Classification for Agricultural and Forestry Research, Education, and Extension, Revision will be provided to the contractor.  For costing purposes, please describe in detail the role of this publication in the indexing process.
ANS.	The Manual of Classification may be used to assist indexers in interpreting the classification applied to the records to be indexed, but it is not required.
18.	Under Government-Furnished Items, Item B, the notice states that the Government will provide to the contractor a sample printout of one hundred (100) CRIS projects showing the title, objectives, approach, non-technical summary, Classification codes, and keywords posted for each project.  For costing purposes, please describe in detail the purpose of providing this material with respect to the project’s goals and objectives
ANS.	The one hundred projects are provided as a representative sample of approved indexing records.  This sample provides an example of indexing records that were done in the past and should help an offeror provide us a quote.
19.	Under Government-Furnished Items, Item C, the agency proposes to provide one (1) copy of VPN client software, one (1) copy of the STAR Client software, and one (1) copy of the instructions for installing the software.  Can the contractor make multiple copies of these items for use under the contract or is the government’s license limited to allowing the contractor to use only a single copy at one time?
ANS.	The STAR client software may be installed on multiple computers. The VPN software CD is for a specific user ID. As the current database configuration allows for three simultaneous users, the government will provide up to three (3) user IDs.
20.	With respect to Government-Furnished Items, Item D, please identify the location of the CRIS training site and the hours scheduled for training of contractor personnel.  Please describe whether there are any prepared printed training materials and training exercises
ANS.	The training will be conducted at the CRIS site (800 9th St., S.W., Washington, DC). Specifics will be determined after contract award. Not all proposed indexers need to be present at the Government-provided training. The contractor may wish to provide subsequent instruction/training offsite.
21.	Is there a size limitation on electronic files sent to the agency?
ANS.  The files are done electronically and no transfer takes place.
22.	The notice states that, in relevant part, that [T]he Government, at its option, may request correction or modification of one or more indexed projects by the contractor if it is determined by the reviewer that more than one (1) indexing term per every ten (10) projects is considered to be (a) Inappropriate for retrieval, or (b) Irrelevant, or (c) Technically inaccurate.  Will the Government document in writing the specific cause for rejection beyond terms a, b, or c?
ANS.	The Government will provide documentation (e-mail) for the specific cause of all rejections.
23.	With respect to reject of records, there appears to be some subjectivity to the rejection process, especially with respect to relevancy.  Please comment on the agency’s historical record of rejection of contractor records.
ANS.	The rejection rate has been low when adequate justification has been submitted.
24.	What is the required turn around time for correcting and resubmitting corrected records?
ANS.	A new batch of records to be indexed will be made available when notification is received that the current batch has been completed. The new batch may not be submitted as complete until all re-indexing on records in the previous batch has been completed.
25.	Please confirm that the Pricing of Quote required under the RFQ requires submission of a unit price and corresponding total price based on 7200 projects.
ANS.	That is correct.
26.	Please confirm that the Cost for evaluation purposes is the total cost of the base plus option years based on 7200 projects per year.
ANS.	That is correct.
27.	Evaluation Criteria A and B appear to be identical.  Criterion B appears to be a more complete explanation of criterion A.  If that is the case, then the notice statement that “Evaluation Criteria A-D are of equal importance” is inappropriate.  .
ANS.  Same as Item 28.
 28.Evaluation Criteria C, Specific Addition or Replacement of Indexers is not a proper evaluation criteria.  If that is the case, then the notice statement that “Evaluation Criteria A-D are of equal importance” is inappropriate.  
ANS.   Evaluation Criterias are changed to read:
•	Criteria A: Technical Approach now includes Education and Work Experience for Proposed Personnel and Addition or Replacement of Indexers.
•	Criteria B: Past Performance/Similar Experience now includes Qualifications for Indexers.
•	Criteria C: Price was formerly listed as Evaluation Criteria D. 
•	PLEASE NOTE:  Criteria A through C are equally important.
29.	What is the average number of terms assigned per record based on requirements or prior contract performance?
ANS.	The historical average is 15-20 terms per record.
30.	Evaluation criterion B.1b Experience has elements that are not reasonably related to the Statement of Work and are hence, improper.  Specifically, “descriptive bibliography” and “descriptive cataloging and classification” are the most egregious.  Please review and revise this criterion.
ANS.	The terms provided are representative examples of functions related to subject analysis of scientific records. They are not inclusive of all functions.
31.	What standard Government form (e.g., SF??, if any) is to be used in submitting a quotation in response to this requirement?  A form which contains a box for self certification as a small business would appear to be prudent.
ANS. SF-18, “ Request for Quotations”   is the form  that all quoters are required to use.

.
32.	Are quotations submitted electronically or by fax acceptable? YES
ANS.  Quotes are being accepted by email and may be sent to the attention of  Douglas.Joyner@ars.usda.gov or via fax to (202)720-3987
33.	Please clarify whether Place of Performance is, as stated in the notice, USDA-CSREES 800 9TH STREET, SW WASHINGTON, DC 20024.
ANS.	The CRIS office and the indexing application are at this location. The indexing may be performed at any site with Internet access.
34.	Quotes are due on Wednesday, June 28, 2006 and the start of performance is stated as Saturday, July 1, 2006.  Please comment whether this is realistic in terms of the evaluation to be conducted by the agency.  Please also comment on whether Saturday is an appropriate day to begin contract performance. ANS.  Amendment #2 extended the due date until July 19, 2006 at 2:00PM EST. for receipt of all quotes. The period of performance will always begin on a business day, Monday through Friday.
35.	Please provide prior contract award data for this activity (e.g., contract number(s), period of performance, dollar value, number of documents to be indexed, unit indexing price/total price).

<CONTACT>B. Lynda Betancourt, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-231-8464, Fax 202-231-2831, Email brunilda.betancourt@dia.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post all questions and answers received in response to combined synopsis/solicitation HHM402-06-R-0025 as follows:

QUESTION #1:  Is there a current incumbent? 

ANSWER:  The current incumbent is SAIC-ASC.

QUESTION #2:  What office at DIA does this support (DS/RR, DS/ES, etc.)?  We need this to incorporate the processes that are in place for that organizational element.

ANSWER:  DS-RRE-2

QUESTION #3.  Questions in regards to paragraph 4.2:  

    3a.  How many concurrent evaluations are planned to occur? (i.e. evaluate three tools simultaneously).  If this is unknown, what should we plan for in the submission?   

ANSWER:  This has a direct impact on approach, staffing, and cost.  Plan on an average of 6 concurrent evaluations being conducted at any point in time over the period of performance.

    3b.  Is the contractor to supply analysts for evaluations or should we plan on using existing DIA analysts?  

ANSWER:  Both.  Defense Intelligence analysts and collectors will be available to virtually participate in some of the evaluations, but the successful offeror needs to provide a core team of technologists that are able to guide, train and assist analysts on unfamiliar technologies.  Those technologists should also have a background in collection or analysis to flesh out the evaluation teams, in the case that real-world events preclude all of the analysts from participating in the evaluation.

QUESTION #4:  Paragraph 4.4:  Exhibit A is referenced but not included.  It is important to have an understanding of the current environment to plan for expansion.

ANSWER:  Please refer to presolicitation notice HHM402-06-R-0025-A for all exhibits, attachments, and clauses in full text.

QUESTION #5:  Other than the Reps/Certs, SOW, and Quality control plan.  Does the government want all resumes submitted separately or as part of the SOW?  Past performance (separate or incorporated into the SOW)?

ANSWER:  Resumes and past performance questionnaires are to be submitted separately.

QUESTION #6:   Are there any format constraints on the submission (page length, type font, MS word, PDF, graphics, etc.) 

ANSWER:  Please refer to Addendum to 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jan 2006), paragraghs 9i.-9iv. which was included under Clauses in Full Text and uploaded under Presolicitation Notice HHM402-06-R-0025-A.

QUESTION #7: Since the primary objective of the solicitation consists of "rapid evaluation and fielding recommendations", I believe that there are OCI issues that need to be clarified and/or resolved since it is possible that the winning offeror will be evaluating systems and tools that their company has fielded.  None of the postings at FedBizOps concerning this solicitation mentions possible OCI issues. Should I assume that you do not have any OCI concerns?

ANSWER:  It is impossible to determine any OCI concerns at this point in time.  OCI issues have not been a concern to date, but they may arise during the period of performance of this contract.  At that time, the successful offeror and the COR shall work together to develop an OCI strategy that meets the needs and goals of the government.  As a general rule, however, offerors should not plan on using personnel currently engaged in product development and/or systems integration to field capabilities within DoDIIS for the reasons mentioned above.

QUESTION #8:  A review of the SOO and RFP does not address any organizational conflict of interest (OCI).  Will the winning Contractor be required to sign an OCI?  With this OCI that Contractor out of any additional work that may be requested in the future?  If yes, can you specify what work the Contractor would be restricted from executing?

If an OCI decision is made, then yes, the contractor’s business unit will be precluded from bidding on SI and/or deployment work for that type of technology in the future for DoDIIS.  Again, given that this contract is heavily focused on advanced COTS technology, this is typically not an issue.

ANSWER:  Please refer to answer to question #7. 

QUESTION #9:  The solicitation description cites: “This requirement is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541513. (formerly SIC Code 7376) at $23,000,000.00 size standard.” Is it restricted to companies with NAICS Code 541513 and under $23,000,000.00 in gross revenue?  

ANSWER:   This combined synopsis/solicitation is unrestricted; however, the requirement falls under NAICS code 541513. The business size standard of $23,000,000.00 is hereby removed.

QUESTION #10:  The SOO, 4.2., discusses the analysis of advanced analytical tools on the operational network or on stand-alone networks.  It indicates that the evaluation spirals should be 3-4 months in duration.  Please identify these networks and the tools to be analyzed.

ANSWER:  The network will be the RDEC network.  The tools will be determined by the needs of the US Government over time.  The tools/applications will be in the COTS-based Knowledge Discovery/Knowledge Visualization area.

QUESTION #11:  The solicitation references RDEC and COBRA; however, this network has very few "moving parts" that have replicated the DoDIIS GES, whereas Lab-X and the RITF have planned for installation and testing for new capabilities intended for the DoDIIS RSCs.  Furthermore, RDEC is a VPN on JWICS with few terminals and limited analytical exposure.  If the plan is to go operational quickly within the DoDIIS Enterprise, will JWICS and LAB-X become more prominent in testing and readying for deployment, and if so, what additional technical information do we need to cover this in our proposal?  This is somewhat related to question 4 above.

ANSWER:  The current plan is to use the RDEC for operational evaluations.  JWICS will never be used for operational evaluations of this type.  RDEC will be a component of Lab-X as the Lab-X environment matures.

QUESTION #12:  The SOO, 4.3., will the offeror be acquiring the products and services of the outside contractors that the offeror shall manage?

ANSWER:  SOO, Paragraph 4.3 has been changed as follows by Amendment 02 to combined synopsis/solicitation HHM402-06-R-0025: "As identified by the COR, but only under the approval of the Contracting Officer (CO), the Contractor may be required to manage other outside contractors that have been identified as having applications that have a high likelihood of meeting high priority analytical requirements."  

QUESTION #13:  The solicitation cites an FFP contract, but as hardware/software and product evaluations, requirements will be determined during the contract duration.  How does DIA expect respondents to cost this?  Should each Contract Line Item have individual ODC line items that will be priced as cost reimbursable line items?  Please provide ODC costing guidance for determining product evaluations and related hardware/software.

ANSWER:  The contract type has been changed to Time and Materials by Amendment 02 to combined synopsis/solicitation HHM402-06-R-0025.  Refer to uploaded Amendment 02 under Presolicitation Notice HHM402-06-R-0025-A.  In addition, refer to combined synopsis/solicitation HHM402-06-R-0025, second paragraph for CLINs and Addendum to 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jan 2006), paragraghs 13i.-iiig for cost proposal instructions.

QUESTION #14:  Is the effort an existing effort or a new effort?  If an existing effort, who is the incumbent and what is the level of effort currently assigned?

ANSWER: The current incumbent is SAIC-ASC.  The current level of effort is not applicable, since this procurement is for a larger level of effort than the current contract.

QUESTION #15:  The solicitation indicates the work will be done on Gov't site with GFE.  MBI requests if sites can be provided, and what type of GFE will DIA provide? 

ANSWER:  The site is the DIAC, and the GFE is the standard suite of desktop applications, as well the equipment contained in Exhibit A.

QUESTION #16:  SOO 4.4 Evaluation Environment states the contractor shall expand the node by adding additional servers or workstations at DIA.  Does Exhibit A, equipment list, represent government furnished equipment (GFE) or equipment the offeror should include in the price proposal?  Also, will the government provide the software (when free evaluation copies are not available) necessary for the effort, or should an estimate of price be built into the proposal? Will the Government provide specialized data sources to meet the SOO?

ANSWER:  Exhibit A represents the existing GFE.  Potential offerors should build in an estimate of the price of evaluation copies of software into the proposal.  The government will provide the necessary data to meet the SOO.

QUESTION #17:  Will the government consider a fixed price, level-of-effort contract type?

ANSWER:  No.  The contract type has been changed to Time and Materials by Amendment 02 to combined synopsis/solicitation HHM402-06-R-0025.  Refer to uploaded Amendment 02 under Presolicitation Notice HHM402-06-R-0025-A.

QUESTION #18:  Invoicing (items c and g) and Reporting Requirements (SOO 9.5 Project Status Report) referencing cost reports and cost expenditure are inconsistent with a firm fixed price contract type.  Will the government alter these requirements?

ANSWER:   The contract type has been changed to Time and Materials by Amendment 02 to combined synopsis/solicitation HHM402-06-R-0025.  Refer to uploaded Amendment 02 under Presolicitation Notice HHM402-06-R-0025-A.

QUESTION #19:  What are the Contract Line Items referenced in Item i. of the Cost Proposal Instructions?

ANSWER:  Please refer to combined synopsis/solicitation HHM402-06-R-0025, second paragraph for Contract Line Items.

QUESTION #20:  The Cost Proposal Instructions also require the completion of a Price Schedule.  Will the government specify, beyond the summary fixed price, what detail is required?

ANSWER:  Please refer to Addendum to 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jan 2006), paragraghs 13i.-iiig. for cost proposal instructions.

QUESTION #21:  Are the past performance questionnaires from the government representatives also due on 3 July by 2PM?  If not, what documentation is expected to indicate satisfaction of this requirement?

ANSWER:  The combined synopsis/solicitation and all required documentation have been extended through 14 July 2006 by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time (EST).

QUESTION #22:  Understanding that the solicitation (in the Clauses in Full Text document) calls for three sources of past performance, are past performance questionnaires required from three government representatives as well?  Are there limits to the number of questionnaires the government will accept?

ANSWER:  In addition to three sources of past performance, past performance questionnaires are encouraged but not required.  Please limit the number of questionnaires to no more than five.

QUESTION #23:  The RFP mentions that you would like to see a "Quality Control Plan" submitted, but the instructions leave no room for submitting one.  Also a number of the management approaches will be in a "Program Management Plan".  How should we address these?  Can we submit a draft of each separate from the technical write-up?

ANSWER:  Submit the Quality Control Plan as part of your technical proposal and ensure it is CLEARLY identified.  The Program Management Plan is a deliverable due 15 days after contract award.

QUESTION #24:  I am very much interested in the "DoDIIS Knowledge Discovery/Knowledge Visualization Research and Evaluation Services" solicitation (HHM402-06-R-0025) that appeared in today's FedBizOps Sort (below).  Since the primary objective of the solicitation consists of "rapid evaluation and fielding recommendations", I believe that there are OCI issues that need to be clarified and/or resolved since it is possible that the winning offeror will be evaluating systems and tools that their company has fielded.  None of the postings at FedBizOps concerning this solicitation mentions possible OCI issues. Should I assume that you do not have any OCI concerns?

ANSWER:  Please refer to answer to question #7.

QUESTION #25:  Related to the DD254 - Courier access/eligibility for contractors (beyond their not being able to use the Defense Courier Service) is not noted in the DD254.  Will the contract allow contractors to courier classified information?

ANSWER:  The contract will allow contractors to courier classified information only within the geographical limitations noted in the DD254.

QUESTION #26:  The DD254 is contradictory on whether this is a TS or TS//SCI contract. Question 10.E.1 of the DD254 states that it will be an SCI contract, but in the addendum question #17 references TOP SECRET only.  

ANSWER:  This will be a TS/SCI contract.  

QUESTION #27:  Understanding that the contractor shall develop and sustain the DIA-based portion of an operational evaluation network in conjunction with the Disruptive Technologies Office (per Section 4.1 of the SOO) and assuming that some of this effort may require working on the network from other government locations, shouldn’t the answer to question 11.A be a "Yes"?

ANSWER:  DD 254, Block 11.A is correctly marked as NO.  It is the intent of the SOO to enable the contractor to access classified material at multiple locations.  If marked Yes, the contractor will only be allowed to access classified information from only one site, in this case the DIAC. 

QUESTION #28:  Is the SOO of 14 April 2006 available online?

ANSWER:  The SOO is listed within the combined synopsis/solicitation HHM402-06-R-0025.  

QUESTION #29:  As I was reviewing this opportunity I noticed that the Statement of Work isn't included. Could you please tell me when the Statement of Work will be posted or if I've just simply over looked part of this document.

ANSWER:  The SOO is listed within the combined synopsis/solicitation HHM402-06-R-0025.  

QUESTION #30:  I, a sole proprietor, have a number of software concepts that will not fit under this Solicitation but would still fall under the DIA umbrella of interest.  Will DIA accept unsolicited proposals?
 
ANSWER:  DIA will not accept unsolicited proposals.


POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACKNOWLEDGING ALL AMENDMENTS TO THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.
