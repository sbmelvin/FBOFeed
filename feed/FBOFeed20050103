<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Business Specialist 7037871263     sharon.teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to contribute to the knowledge base that is needed for public officials to pursue balanced decision making in the management and development of Federal sand borrow areas identified for use in nearby beach nourishment coastal restoration projects and HEREBY SOLICITS REQUESTS FOR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS from interested parties to propose on this requirement. INTRODUCTION: The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement-type contract.  The Solicitation Number for this requirement is 1435-01-05-RP-39054 and must be referenced on your written documents.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  All offerors must be able to qualify under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541710 "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (less than 500 employees)."   The United States (U. S.) Government, and specifically, the Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal OCS.  Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994, gave the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the rights to OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government.   MMS has been actively cooperating with coastal states in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico during the conduct of geologic and geophysical studies to identify potential offshore sand sites with sufficient quantity and the required quality of sand needed for planned and future beach and coastal restoration projects. Sand resources in Federal waters offshore the west Florida coast counties of Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee, and Collier are actively being investigated for long-term use as beach nourishment material despite the fact that Federal jurisdiction begins approximately 9 miles out from the coast. Dredging significant amounts of sand within the offshore area could result in long-term, adverse impacts on the biological and physical environments if mitigation measures are not properly implemented. Site-specific biological and physical information is necessary prior to negotiating leases for the use of offshore sand borrow sites.  This information can be used to suggest engineering options and mitigation measures that can reduce and avoid potential long-term, adverse impacts, while allowing for the selective removal of the needed volumes of sand for nearby beach projects. As the Federal agency responsible for regulation of OCS sand resources, the MMS must ensure that sand and gravel dredging operations conducted under its jurisdiction are being conducted in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  SCOPE OF WORK: Specific study tasks will include the development and conduct of a biological field data collection/computer numerical modeling program to address the following issues: Characterization and evaluation of benthic habitats, biological communities (infauna, epifauna, demersal, and pelagic fishes), and sediment grain size in potential borrow areas. Biological field data collected will be used in conjunction with existing literature to the maximum extent possible; Assessment of the potential effects of offshore sand dredging on benthic and pelagic communities, including an analysis of the potential rate and success of recolonization following cessation of dredging; Using the procedures and conclusions set out in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Special Report 262: A Process for Setting, Managing, and Monitoring Environmental Windows for Dredging Projects (http://trb.org//publications/sr/sr262.pdf) as a guide, development of a time schedule of environmental windows that best protects benthic and pelagic species from adverse environmental effects; Examination of the potential for alteration in the local wave field following dredging and the excavation of sand from within potential sand borrow sites offshore the west coast of Florida; Examination of the potential for increased wave action after dredging within potential sand borrow sites and any resultant adverse localized changes in erosional patterns and longshore coastal transport which could result in significant losses of beach sand after renourishment; Examination of the potential for changes in local sediment transport rates as a result of altering the local bathymetry, particularly in light of the recent studies which indicate that bathymetry does influence the manner in which waves approach the shoreline during storm events; Examination of the cumulative physical effects of multiple dredging events and extraction of a large volume of material within the identified potential borrow sites; Examination, on a generic basis using numerical wave modeling, the potential for adverse effects on the physical wave field from dredging along the west Florida shelf, taking into account the differences in topography between this area and the Atlantic offshore area. The period of performance of this effort is anticipated to be a maximum of 32 months from date of contract award.  The estimated cost range is $475,000 to $525,000.  QUALIFICATION FACTORS: To compete for this contract, an offeror must demonstrate qualifications to perform the work by providing, no later than close of business, January 27, 2005,  a Capabilities Statement describing in detail:  (A) Key technical personnel and their demonstrated ability to collect, interpret and synthesis information. Particularly relevant is their  expertise and experience in the fields of marine benthic biology and ecology, physical oceanography and numerical wave modeling, marine and coastal geology, other oceanography disciplines as required, their experience in the type of work proposed and demonstrated ability to do the work. This experience must be demonstrated through authorship in appropriate peer reviewed publications.  Assessment factors will be their qualifications, the relevance of their qualifications to their assigned task, and their estimated level of effort; (B) Key technical personnel who will be responsible for the organization of information and the production of documents and manuscripts. The offerer shall provide information on which tasks(s) each key person will perform; qualifications for completing those tasks; and the rationale for that assignment. (C) The offering organization's expertise with this type of work and a description of relevant facilities and resources. (D) Specific references including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number for previous work of this nature conducted by the organization and/or organization personnel. REFERENCES WILL BE CHECKED.  Capabilities Statements will be evaluated on the basis of: (A) Understanding of project scope and objectives; (B) Experience and expertise of all key technical personnel; (C) Relevance of all key personnel's qualifications to their assigned task, and their estimated level of effort; (D) Organizational history of timely completing similar projects, adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of cost controls, and quality of products delivered; (E) The degree of comparability of past projects to the current project, including number, complexity, and size. Subcontracts and partners will be considered. Offerors must submit a Capabilities Statement in original form and five (5) copies of your response to the attention of: Sharon Teger, Contracting Officer, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, and if using regular U.S. mail - MS 2100, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170; or if hand delivered or using a courier service - 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170.

It is the Government's intention to purchase one airboat from Diamondback Airboats, Inc. to ensure capability and readiness of the current airboat fleet to support short notice launch and landing requirements for the space shuttle.	The airboat needs to be a Diamondback, because we currently have another Diamondback in the fleet of police pursuit boats and the cage, seat frame, and motors need to be interchanged and removed for maintenance to ensure readiness.  Diamondback Airboats, Inc. is the only company that can insure that the rigging and stringers are compatible with the other airboat necessary for quick change out of components from one airboat to another. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Name:  Justin Pane Title:	Contract Specialist Phone:	(321) 867-8912 Fax:  (321) 867-1141 E-mail:  Justin.C.Pane@nasa.gov not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on 1/10/2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Previous modification had indicated that a QPL (qualified Products List) is in effect for these products and must be adhered to.  Please note instructions on viewing QPL list on page 2 of solicitation.
This Solicitation is to establish a SQA (standing quote agreement) for a period of one year from the date of award for the nsn’s listed below.  See attached Solicitation for more information.   The destinations and quantities will be determined by on demand requisitions from various agencies.  The quantities listed are not correct, as we have no way of knowing the quantities that will be requested for a SQA period.  You must also send a copy of each MSDS for each quote that requires it.  Also attached to the solicitation is an additional worksheet for the MSDS.  If all information on the worksheet is not incorporated into the MSDS, then please fill out the additional worksheet and send that also.

<DESC>UPDATE, 3 JAN 05:  Regarding the Draft RFP posted 30 Dec 04, please be advised that the updated DRAFT RFP has a potential for up to a 10  year period of performance as opposed to the original 5 year period of performance.  All comments/questions to the current Draft RFP  should be received no later than 12:00 EST on 10 Jan 05.  The  Government may not respond with direct answers but may incorporate  comments into the Final RFP. UPDATE, 30 DEC 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in response to the questions/comments to the DRFP posted 3 Nov 04.  Only documents with changes/updates are posted.  This includes the updated DRFP, Section L and Section M.  Blue change bars highlight changes made.  A document entitled "Industry Questions and Responses, 30 Dec 04" has also been posted.  Questions can be directed to Cheryle Lankford, 937-904-4197, or Capt. Jason Ortiz, 937-904-4609.  UPDATE, 24 NOV 04:  Our e-mail system went down November 12 and was out not fixed until sometime the following week.  As a result, some e-mail  was lost.  If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.

<DESC>Note 22 applies.  The Government intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with High Tech Industries of Corona, CA for design,fabrication, and installation of custom consoles for a digital-server based radio broadcast system.  The consoles will provide expanded control capacities by combining various outboard functions to new centralized locations.  The custom design will allow similar viewing locations, workspace layout, and ergonomics of existing systems while incorporating new equipment consistent with the design of the digital-server radio broadcast system.  This requirement is time-sensitive because of the anticipated award of the digital radio project contract, and the need to make space for the digital radio section, which will change location from the shared space of the digital-server based television system presently in operation.  The digital television system uses consoles similar to the ones planned for this procurement, with design features that can be easily adapted for use by radio.  The television consoles were designed by High Tech Industries.

<DESC>USAID/Washington (hereinafter to as USAID) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) to provide recruitment, employment, and backstopping of Technical Advisors in AIDS, Child Survival, Infectious Diseases, Population and Basic Education (hereafter abbreviated TAACS) as authorized in the Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act FY 87 to assist USAID in the implementation of priority programs in the health, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, population and basic education sectors.  

The RFP will be issued/posted on USAID’s agency website: www.fedbizops.gov under the section on business and procurement on or about January 18, 2005.

Background information follows:

The TAACS Program is managed by the Bureau for Global Health (GH), and is currently providing 69 TAACS to the Agency, approximately half of whom are serving with overseas Missions.  Because the TAACS mechanism is a major Agency resource, providing staff with direct-hire authorities to carry out the Agency’s key programs, a TAACS contract that provides strong recruitment and backstopping support is essential to the Agency’s effectiveness, particularly to Basic Education and the Expanded Response in HIV-AIDS and Infectious Diseases.  

The Contractor shall reliably and efficiently complete tasks for recruitment, hiring and placement, training, backstopping, supervising, and evaluating TAACS, who will provide long term technical and managerial assistance to USAID overseas and to various technical offices in USAID/Washington. They will work in the design, management, implementation and evaluation of child survival, HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, population and basic education activities. Upon selection, the Contractor will employ them as employees of the Contractor’s organization while the TAACS provide technical advice and management capabilities to the USAID Offices and Missions.

The USAID TAACS Program Coordinator, Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and the Contract Director shall undertake appropriate coordination with other USAID offices, bureaus, and Missions with respect to the Agency guidance on Technical Advisors in AIDS and Child Survival, as contained in USAID Automated Directives System (ADS) Series 200, References.  A list of prospective bidders will be provided in the solicitation.  Please send written requests to sjohnson@usaid to be included on the bidder's list.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the previous posting dated 12-17-04. It provides answers to nine technical quetions. All information contained in the 12-17-04 posting still applies and remains unchanged. Below please find nine technical questions and answers regarding the the LCMR:  Question #1 What subsystem components or assemblies are expected to comprise the 150 pounds stand alone weight, and what additional components will increase to the total system weight of 500 pounds? Answer: The Mission Essential weight (150 pounds max) includes all items required to operate the radar in a stand alone configuration. This includes the following items: - Operating radar system (Electronics and Antenna) - Radar support such as mount or tripod, or other solution - A target acquisition data display unit (Computer, Laptop computer or PDA) - Communications system which is capable of transmitting the radar target acquisition data up to 1 km - All cables associated with the systems power and communications operation - Any (1) one of the following portable power sources - battery power for 6 hours (including battery weight and battery case weight if applicable) or a portable generator or other solution to supply mission essential (remote) operational power. The Complete System weight (500 pounds max) Includes these items however may not be limited to these items: - Vehicle mounting kit - Fixed operation (24-7 mission capable) power supply unit - A more permanent or rugged Radar mounting system (such as HMMWV or other) - Communications radio package (other than mission essential 1 km transmitter) - Rugged radome - Transit cases  - Cables not associated with Mission Essential operation equipment but that may be required for long term operation Question #2 Is operation on the move required or desirable? Answer: Radar operation on the move is desirable, but not required, however transmit on the move is required. Transmit on the move is defined as the ability to automatically transmit previously acquired target data while on the move.  The radar need not be operational while on the move.  Question #3 For common display of  Firefinder and O-LCMR data, is an interface protocol and message ICD envisioned to port Firefinder reports directly to the O-LCMR system?  Answer: Yes.  An interface protocol and message ICD is envisioned to port Firefinder reports directly to the O-LCMR system as well as be capable of porting O-LCMR reports directly to the Firefinder systems. Question #4 Are built in low light level characteristics to allow using laptops at night, requiring all controls to be self illuminating? Is the same true of maintenance? Answer: Yes.  However, the display brightness of any display must be adjustable to compensate for light or tactical conditions. Question #5 What is the degree of hardening required for explosive ordinance? Answer: There is no requirement for explosive ordinance hardening.   However, hardening is desirable and should be considered in conjunction with the weight budget.  Question #6 Is the EW Environment strictly intercept, locate and jamming? Answer:  The predominant EW threat to the O-LCMR mission is intercept, locate and jamming. Question #7 Is the radar required to accept AFATDS missions when they can be performed, or will specific tasks be assigned each O-LCMR? Answer; The O-LCMR must be capable of uploading mission plans directly through its local interface.  It is desired that this occur remotely via AFATDS or any Future combat systems method of communications. Question #8 Is an ORD or CDD available for industry review? Answer: No ORD or CDD is available for review at this time as the documents are currently in process. Question #9 What is the acquisition schedule for this program, MS B, MS C, LRIP, IOC, FOC? Answer: MS B program execution will commence in 1QFY06 with a production decision 24 months from RDTE contract awa rd

<DESC>NASA is seeking capabilities from 8(a) small businesses to determine the appropriate level of competition for this requirement, which is the development, implementation, and delivery of the NASA Small Business Training Program.  The purpose of this program is to teach small and small disadvantaged businesses the skills necessary to market NASA, compete for NASA procurements, and execute a NASA contract or subcontract successfully.   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  THE DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK FOR THIS REQUIREMENT IS PUBLISHED BELOW.  Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the requirement should submit a capability statement of no more than fifteen (15) pages, indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Capability statements should be in hard copy.  Interested offerors must also include a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter.  All responses shall be submitted to the point of contact below no later than January 18, 2005.  Please include the reference number NNH0586873L in any response.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.  NASA SMALL BUSINESS TRAINING PROGRAM         DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK  C.1	BACKGROUND  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) seeks to create and maintain a reliable base of small businesses capable of providing sound and innovative technical solutions that will assist the Agency to achieve its objectives and advance its mission.  The OSDBU further seeks to ensure that these small businesses are able to compete successfully for NASA contracts and subcontracts and to understand and manage the contract requirements.  To achieve these ends, the OSDBU, in 1994, created the Training and Development of Small Businesses in Advanced Technologies (TADSBAT) program, which, in conjunction with Public Laws 101-144 and 107-507 and NASA’s OSDBU Functional Leadership Plan, seeks to encourage and increase small business participation in NASA programs.  Agency-wide changes in its mission and vision as well as changes in federal procurement practices have necessitated a re-conceptualization of the OSDBU’s training initiative.  In response, the OSDBU has established the NASA Small Business Training Program, which will revise TADSBAT while continuing to target small businesses interested in seeking procurement opportunities within NASA’s highly technical and complex environment.  The OSDBU anticipates that a result of such training will be an increase in contract and subcontract awards to all categories of high tech small businesses, including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), HUBZone firms, and Veteran-Owned / Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (V/SDVOSB), thereby expanding NASA’s competitive base of contractors from which it purchases high quality goods and services at the best practicable value.  Providing small and small disadvantaged businesses instruction in marketing their services to NASA and in instituting management techniques that are responsive to NASA requirements has helped NASA “grow” a more capable cadre of potential contractors interested in obtaining NASA-related work and has improved NASA’s overall performance in accomplishing its mission.  For participating small businesses, the benefit has been twofold: in addition to teaching them how to do business with NASA, such training, exportable to the wider federal procurement arena, contributes to their own growth and viability.  C.2	SCOPE  The NASA Small Business Training Program will be a redesign of TADSBAT, the existing OSDBU training program for small businesses.  It will update and modify TADSBAT to reflect recent changes in NASA’s organizational structure and priorities as well as build on TADSBAT’s success in teaching small businesses to develop business management skills that will enable them to: ·	Understand NASA’s mission, vision, organization, culture,		and long-term programmatic needs ·	Develop a marketing approach consistent with the NASA mission, in order to market appropriate business and technical solutions ·	Utilize NASA’s small business-friendly programs and initiatives to obtain business ·	Monitor project requirements and performance ·	Implement and maintain appropriate accounting systems for contract costs ·	Generate required reports Like TADSBAT, the Small Business Training Program will consist of two training courses:  a basic, introductory course for high tech small businesses that are new to NASA programs and an advanced course that targets more experienced high tech small businesses.  The contractor will be expected to develop and implement the NASA Small Business Training Program and to deliver the courses, employing innovative and effective instructional methodologies that enhance learning and ensuring that the courses are appropriate to the senior executive officers of high tech small businesses.  The courses will acquaint participants to NASA and its culture and will teach them the skills necessary to market NASA, compete for NASA procurements, and execute a NASA contract or subcontract successfully.  The ideal contractor for the NASA Small Business Training Program is a mature 8(a) firm that has demonstrated its success in meeting the challenges of starting, growing, and sustaining a business and, therefore, is knowledgeable about procurement vehicles, marketing strategies, proposal writing, financial issues, business management, and information technology.  Of equal importance, the 8(a) firm must have a working understanding of NASA, its field Centers, its organization and business culture, its mission, and its vision.  The 8(a) firm must be experienced in instructional design / strategies and in conducting training courses and managing training programs.  The 8(a) firm should also possess a successful record of working with other federal, commercial, state, and/or local government clients.  C.3	REQUIREMENTS  Development and implementation of the NASA Small Business Training Program requires the following:  (1) development of an overall Training Plan, (2) design and development of the training courses, (3) delivery of the courses, (4) administration of the Training Program, and (5) qualified training personnel.	Following are the tasks associated with each of these components.  C.3.1	Training Plan  The contractor shall conduct a review of the existing Training and Development of Small Businesses in Advanced Technologies (TADSBAT) courses and all related training materials, to determine the strengths of the courses as well as any need for updates and/or revisions.  The contractor shall also evaluate the courses’ appropriateness to NASA’s operational configuration, priorities, and procedures.	The NASA OSDBU will make these training and training-related materials available to the contractor upon award of contract.  The contractor shall then develop a draft Training Plan that is based on the review findings and that serves as the conceptual underpinning for the NASA Small Business Training Program.  The draft Training Plan shall discuss the contractor’s approach to training entrepreneurs and executives and shall describe expected learning objectives, instructional strategies, evaluation strategies, instructor training to ensure quality and consistency, training program administration, and support to students.  The draft Training Plan shall also include a timeline that indicates submittal dates for the materials listed in this Statement of Work, deadlines for completion, and milestones for administrative logistics.  The draft Training Plan shall be submitted to the OSDBU thirty (30) calendar days after contract award.  NASA shall provide comments within two (2) weeks, and the contractor shall make the required changes.  The Training Plan shall be finalized when approved.  C.3.2	Course Design and Development  The NASA Small Business Training Program shall consist of (1) a Basic Training Course that introduces small businesses to NASA, its programs, and its mission requirements and provides information on strategies for pursuing procurement opportunities, and (2) a follow-on Advanced Training Course that focuses on marketing techniques and successful management and execution of NASA contracts and subcontracts.  C.3.2a		Basic Training Course  The Basic Training Course shall include but not be limited to modules on the following topics:  ·	Understanding NASA: Vision, Mission, Organizational Structure, Major Programs ·	NASA Small Business Program ·	Federal Procurement Processes (introduction) ·	Subcontracting:  NASA Policy, Subcontract Goals, Prime Contractors ·	Teaming Agreements ·	NASA Safety Program ·	Ethics ·	Proposal Writing, Part 1 ·	Learning from Losing The contractor shall develop and submit to the OSDBU for review a Course Plan that is consistent with the approved Training Plan.

The contractor shall also submit to the OSDBU for review draft instructor and student manuals to be used in the Basic Training Course as well as drafts of any other course materials.  The Course Plan and draft manuals and course materials shall be due to the OSDBU forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the start of the course.  NASA shall provide comments within two (2) weeks, and the contractor shall make the required changes.  C.3.2b		Advanced Training Course  The Advanced Training Course shall include but not be limited to modules on the following topics:  ·	NASA Policies, Programs, Initiatives (update) ·	NASA Small Business Program (refresher) ·	Marketing NASA ·	Proposal Writing, Part 2 ·	Contract Management:  Task / Project Management, Technical Performance ·	Contract Administration:  Accounting, Schedules and Deadlines, Reporting ·	Contract Closeout ·	Audits The contractor shall develop and submit to the OSDBU for approval a Course Plan that is consistent with the approved Training Plan.  The Course Plan shall list the learning objectives of the Advanced Training Course, include an outline and brief description of the course content, and indicate the instructional methodology to be used with each module taught.	Instructional methodologies may include but are not limited to lectures, case studies, scenarios, in-group activities, and role-playing.  The contractor shall also submit to the OSDBU for review draft instructor and student manuals to be used in the Advanced Training Course as well as drafts of any other course materials.  The Course Plan and draft manuals and course materials shall be due to the OSDBU forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the start of the course.  NASA shall provide comments within two (2) weeks, and the contractor shall make the required changes.  C.3.3	Course Delivery  NASA anticipates that the Basic Course and the Advanced Course will each be conducted two (2) times per contract year and will issue delivery orders to that effect.  However, the anticipated number of delivery orders issued is merely NASA’s best estimate and does not constitute a commitment on the part of the government to order said quantities.  Additional courses may be ordered and added to the schedule if demand for the courses is high and funding is available.	The specific ordering procedures are set forth in the contract’s “Ordering,” “Order Limitations,” and “Indefinite Quantity” clauses.  The contractor shall present the courses over three days of instruction.  The courses shall be held at or near NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, and at other sites in close proximity to NASA field centers, the locations of which will be decided upon by the OSDBU.

The contractor shall classify all Puerto Rico address records as mailable and non-mailable in order to support the Geography Division with adequate planning and conducting Census Bureau operations such as the Puerto Rico Community Survey and the 2010 Decennial Census.  

The contractor shall analyze the results of the PR MAF to the Delivery Sequence File (DSF) match, and classify each address record as one of the following:

Deliverability Flag  
1.  Exact DSF Match - The PR MAF address exactly matches with a DSF address, down to the ZIP+4 level.

2.  Equivocated DSF Match - The PR MAF address matches with a DSF address, but some of the address information is not an exact match.  For example, the ZIP+4 codes do not match.

3.  No DSF Match Potentially Deliverable - The PR MAF address contains all of the necessary components for mailing (including 5 digit ZIP) but the address could not be matched to a DSF address and delivery cannot be guaranteed.

4.  Undeliverable - The PR MAF address is not mailable because it is missing critical delivery information, or it only contains a location description.

5.  PO Box - The PR MAF mailing address is a post office (PO) box address.

6. Previously Matched - The address doesn’t match the current DSF, but matched to one or more previous DSFs.  

Addressing Conversions and New address Updates Activity 5

The contractor shall identify the most recent address conversion areas and the addresses associated with the new residential units   across Puerto Rico through field presence and access to local knowledge about planned or recently completed residential subdivisions.

		Assignment of Pre-defined Algorithm Codes- Activity 7

The contractor shall assign a pre-defined algorithm code to each new or revised address record. The Census Bureau will provide the algorithm codes and the associated logic for setting each code.

Address Problem Resolution Support- Activity 8

The contractor shall provide “Consultation services” that will likely involve conference calls or government site meetings as needed. The consulting services will assist the Geography Division in its effort to move towards self-sufficiency in processing, maintaining and utilizing addresses in the Puerto Rico Master Address File.  Census Bureau staff will schedule calls or onsite meetings with as little as a week notification.


The Census Bureau will supply:
1. Puerto Rico MAF work file
2. Computer-readable files (TIGER/Lines) as a source for identifying the   bounding features and unique geocodes associated with each census block.
3. Algorithm codes 
4. DSF file

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<SUBJECT>B -- Long Term Career Outcomes Study of USUHS Graduates
<SOLNBR>RFQ-05-0002
<RESPDATE>010305
<ARCHDATE>01222005
<CONTACT>John Friedhoff, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-295-3868, Fax 301-295-2726, Email jfriedhoff@usuhs.mil
<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, MD requires the contractor to conduct a Long-term Career Outcomes Study (LtCOS) of USUHS Graduates.  This is a Small Business Set-Aside.
Statement of Work:  Long-term Career Outcomes Study (LtCOS) of USUHS Graduates Purpose and General Concept:
The purpose of the LtCOS is three-fold:
1.	To quantify the medical and military professional accomplishments of USUHS medical school graduates (classes of 1980-1999) during their military careers.
2.	To determine whether there are predictive relationships between career accomplishments (outcomes) with social, academic or behavioral characteristics identified either during the medical school application process or the period of enrollment at the university (inputs).							
3.	To compare the career accomplishments of USUHS graduates with a sample of physicians currently serving on active duty who did not attend the USUHS.
It is anticipated that the findings of this study may lead to improvements in the university admissions, student promotions and graduate medical education selection processes.
An expandable relational database composed of input and outcome parameters and incorporating statistical analysis capability will be developed:  
For USUHS graduates the database will be populated with both administrative data currently residing in university electronic databases or hardcopy files and survey data obtained either via a web-based secure and confidential survey tool or via submission of hard-copy surveys.  It is anticipated that most USUHS graduate physicians will use the web-based methodology, but some may prefer to submit hard-copy surveys and that the data set may include input for up to 3300 graduates (all members of the classes of 1980-1999, either currently on active duty or no longer serving on active duty).	Instructions for completion of the survey will be mailed via US Mail to all USUHS graduates.
The database will also be populated by data relating to approximately 2000 non-USUHS graduate physicians currently serving on active duty.  Only survey data will be used for this group, and it is anticipated that nearly all data provided by this group will be via the web-based survey, though some data provided by hard-copy survey submissions may need to be individually loaded.  Instructions for completion of surveys will be conveyed electronically to all non-USUHS graduate physicians via uniformed service channels.
It will be critical that the database be designed to permit comparison between USUHS graduate physicians and non-USUHS graduate physicians, in addition to comparisons related to other elements within each group (social, academic or other demographic data, inputs and outcomes).
Analysis of the data using standard statistical methodology will quantify career accomplishments and enable the university to assess the contributions of inputs to outcomes where existent as regards its graduates and facilitate comparisons between USUHS graduate physicians and non-USUHS graduates physicians currently serving on active duty.  Presentation of data in private and public forums and publication of representative data in the public domain will enhance the desirability of longer-term administrative tracking of outcomes thus alleviating the necessity for survey methodology where practicable.
There are approximately 3300 USUHS graduates and 2000 HPSP graduates whose data will serve as the basis for this study.  The study will run for one year from the award of contract date and the contract is for one year.  
Place and Period of Performance:  The work may be performed on site at the Uniformed Services University, or off site via the internet-based methodology.

Contractor’s Responsibilities-- Elements of Work/Deadlines to be Met:
Advanced Technical Support: 
1.Design expandable relational database to include a statistical analysis package capable of performing standard statistical operations including regression analysis; develop discrete definitions for data element fields.  The contractor will work closely with the University Information Systems (UIS) department which controls other USUHS databases, access to university information management and information technology systems and the university website.  The data and created database will remain the property of the USUHS and the database and web-based survey will not be proprietary contractor-owned products.  The database will be linked to a web-based survey (see below) and access to the database will be limited (password controlled) to those identified by Associate Dean, Student Affairs as having reason for access.  Finally the database must be usable and operational by USUHS after the contract ends with no need for additional contract support.						
2.Develop web-based survey based upon data elements determined by the primary and co-investigators (referred to as the LtCOS working group).  Data obtained via the web-based survey must automatically populate data fields of the expandable relational database.  Enable, test and implement the web-based survey and linkage to the database.  The Web-based survey and relational database must be operational by 31 March 2005.				
3.Populate data fields in the relational database, not otherwise populated by the web-based survey tool using either other currently available, electronically accessible legacy university databases or via extraction of data from hardcopy files currently resident in the Office of Admissions, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of Student Affairs, the Office of Alumni Affairs, the Office of the Commandant or hard-copy surveys returned via the mail or email from USUHS graduates and non-USUHS graduate physicians.  Though it is anticipated that most survey data will be provided via on-line web-based submission data from approximately 750-1000 physicians (combined USUHS and non-USUHS) surveys may have to be loaded manually.  The university will provide, in a single location, all the necessary hard copy files related to its graduates, but most data is available administratively in electronic files.  All data must be loaded into the database by 1 August 2005.	
4.Perform statistical analysis and canned query development where appropriate to quantitate the medical and military professional accomplishments of USUHS and non-USUHS graduates and to relate these outcomes to the inputs.  Comparison data between USUHS and non-USUHS graduates will be crucial.  Portray quantitative data and relational in spreadsheets, graphs and tables and format these for presentation in PowerPoint.  It is envisioned that 30-50 slides and 20-40 tables/figures may be necessary to portray the data or provide submissions for publication. Microsoft software products will be used exclusively for this component of the project.  Data analysis and preparation of slides, tables and figures must be completed by end of contract period.  All spreadsheets or other data fields used to create tables and figures will be provide to the government in electronic format NLT end of the contract period.
The specific elements of data analysis which will be investigated will be determined by USUHS depending upon how robust the data fields seems to be after loading of the data.
Administrative/Clerical Support:  The contractor will perform the following:
1.Manage all correspondence related to the LtCOS including mailing of surveys to USUHS graduates (two mailings may be necessary to enhance response rates), mailing of incentive gifts to survey responders who are USUHS graduates (hard copy and web-based responders), collection of returned hard copy surveys and loading of this data manually into the relational database.  It is envisioned that the first mailing (notification of upcoming survey study) to graduates will go out by 15 March 2005 with subsequent mailings at the end of March 2005 (final instructions, actual survey and web-link) so that data may be provided by the graduates beginning on 1 April 2005.
2.Assist with preparation of manuscripts and presentations.  
Government Responsibilities:  
The Government will provide office workspace, a computer and printer, paper and miscellaneous office supplies, postal addresses and email addresses of USUHS graduates (where available), appropriate software and licensure costs.
Final Submissions:  At the end of the performance period the contractor will provide a comprehensive statistical analysis of professional outcomes of USUHS graduates linked through appropriate statistical methodology to socio-academic-demographic data elements in conjunction comparison analysis with non-USUHS graduates.  Data will be portrayed in PowerPoint slides and appropriately formatted tables and figures for publication.  In addition the contractor will provide instructional materials to USUHS staff so that they may continue to utilize the database without the need for additional contract support.

<DESC>Questions and Answers for solicitation W91RUS-05-R-0002: Q: 1. Section C.1.2.1 states that electronic fax service will send/receive documents between the MTF and other locations. Does this require encryption (secure documents) to non-MTF facilities?  A: 1.  Yes.  In fact the purpose of the business is between MTFs and their Managed Care Support Contractors.  It does not preclude MTF to MTF business--but that is not the primary intention of the work. Q: 2. Is the system required to be deployed on Feb 1, 2005. A: 2.  The system must be operational by 1 Feb. Q: 3. How many references (Past Performance)? A: 3.  No more than 10. Q: 4. We assume this project is funded for FY05. Can you share the Government's budgetary estimate for the FY05 fax service? A: 4.  The Government's internal estimate will not be provided as it is considered procurement sensitive.
