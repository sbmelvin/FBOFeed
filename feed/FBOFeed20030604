<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c), with North Carolina State University, of Raleigh, North Carolina, to acquire expert services for the immobilization of proteins in surface bound bi-layer membranes.  These services are required for the Optical Technology Division and the Physics Laboratory at NIST, who are tasked with the development of advanced nonlinear optical techniques for healthcare applications, such as tissue engineered medical devices, biological sensors and therapeutic and drug delivery systems.*****Sole source determination is based on the Government's need for very specialized skills in both nonlinear optical techniques and in the preparation of compatible biological samples to be studied by the techniques.  The stringent sample requirements are: (a) to attach and confirm the attachment of high purity, vectorally oriented transmembrane proteins in biomimetic membranes bound to SFG compatible substrates under aqueous conditions and at physiological concentrations.  Also required is the interactive capability of implementing the sample preparation procedure during the course of a SFG measurement at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD site.
*****Professor Stefan Franzen, in the North Carolina State University Chemistry Department, is a world-renowned scientist and the top leader in the field of the attachment of biological molecules to surfaces.  Prof. Franzen has developed a process that makes his research group uniquely able to attach, orient and confirm the attachment of the variety of transmembrane proteins and peptides defined by NIST researchers as necessary for the development of the advanced nonlinear optical techniques.  In addition, Prof. Franzen possesses expertise in the step by step modification of SFG substrates with NiNTA tags, the expression of transmembrane proteins and peptides with a 6X His-tag, the conjugation and vectoral orientation of the His-tagged protein or peptide to the modified SFG surface under appropriate conditions, characterization of the samples, and confirmation of the sample purity.  Thus, North Carolina State University, via Prof. Franzen's group, is uniquely qualified to meet the Government's need.*****The period of performance will be seven (7) months from date of purchase order award.*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by June 18, 2003, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.*****See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
	
	
A.  BACKGROUND AND NEED

The Business Responds to AIDS/Labor Responds to AIDS (BRTA/LRTA) Programs are a worldwide public/private partnership, which serves as a resource to business and labor on a full range of HIV/AIDS issues through the provision of technical assistance and implementation of comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention workplace programs that combat complacency and stigma and support community activism, volunteerism and corporate philanthropy.

By the end of 2001, 40 million people were living with HIV globally, of whom 37.2 million are adults in their most productive years.  There were 5 million new HIV infections in 2001.  In the United States, close to 1 million people are currently infected and some 40,000 new infections occur each year.  The potential impact of this global epidemic could equal 1.4% of the world gross domestic product annually.  Due to today’s global markets, the costs of the epidemic overseas will be felt domestically as well.  Every workplace will experience the consequences of this pandemic.  
                                                                  Education is our best method of preventing HIV infection, and the workplace offers an excellent forum for teaching prevention messages.  Employers are a highly credible source of information for employees. Surveys have shown that employees think more highly of those employers that offer workplace education programs.  Today's workplace offers access to people of every race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, and age since all segments of the population are found in the workplace. More than half (55%) of American workers are between 25 and 44 years of age. Three-quarters (75%) of the people reported with AIDS are in that same age group. The workplace offers unique access to this concentration of the age-appropriate population as well as their families and the communities in which they reside.  

Changes in the HIV/AIDS epidemic, such as steady infection rates coupled with more people living and working longer, are intensifying the workplace challenge to combat and address HIV/AIDS.  With medical treatment, HIV positive employees can manage the infection as a chronic long-term condition.  This will result in more HIV-positive employees on the job in the future.  This inevitably focuses more attention on HIV as a workplace issue.  In addition, HIV/AIDS is having a devastating impact on the global economy, affecting the workplace both domestically and internationally.  Coupled with survey data that indicate employers can be viewed as an extremely credible source of HIV/AIDS information when worksite training is presented with the full endorsement of management and that employees want their employers to offer HIV workplace education (73%) and are willing to participate in programs that could help their children (54%), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to provide the Business Responds to AIDS (BRTA) and the Labor Responds to AIDS (LRTA) Programs.

CDC launched the BRTA Program in 1992 with a nationally broadcasted teleconference down linked and viewed at more than 1,200 sites, reaching businesses, labor organizations, universities and American Red Cross offices.  The Labor Responds to AIDS Program was launched in conjunction with the union movement in 1994.  Although these programs were initially established for domestic use, there is now an increasing demand by multi-national corporations for their implementation globally.
									
B.  CONTRACT PURPOSE

To assist CDC in engaging business and labor sectors in a comprehensive and collaborative effort with other key partners to enhance the health, productivity, and well being of workers and their families living with, affected by, or at risk for HIV/AIDS through implementation of workplace and related programs.
	
C.	SCOPE OF WORK

Project Objectives:
The contractor shall provide the supplies, services, skills, contacts, knowledge, and experience to assist CDC in engaging U.S and multi-national business and labor leaders in comprehensive workplace programs designed to educate employees, their families, and their communities about HIV prevention.  Specific goals are as follows:

1.	 To increase public understanding of, involvement in, and support for HIV/AIDS prevention in the workplace.
2.	To increase business and labor’s understanding of, involvement in, and support for HIV/prevention in the workplace.
3.	To prevent or reduce behaviors or practices that place persons at risk for HIV infection, or if already infected, place others at risk.
4.	To increase individual knowledge of HIV serostatus and improve referral and resource systems to appropriate prevention services.
5.	To build and maintain the necessary State, local, and community support infrastructure and technical capacity to carry out the necessary workplace prevention programs.
6.	To increase technical assistance and capacity building efforts in business and labor union workplaces provided through consultation, training, written materials, and large and small group meetings.
7.	To increase health education and risk reduction through the BRTA/LRTA Manager’s and Labor Leader’s Kits.  These kits direct business managers and supervisors and labor leaders to provide resources in the workplace for persons or their families/friends whose behaviors or personal circumstances place them at high risk.
8.	To evaluate and conduct research activities as necessary to conduct formative, process, outcome, and impact evaluation of HIV workplace prevention education.
9.	To train and assure high quality of activities which focus on capacity building within businesses and unions, as well as grantees.  Grantees routinely assess the performance and training needs of staff that provide HIV prevention services.  Comprehensive quality assurance procedures and standards produce feedback, including review of relevant program data and client satisfaction services.
10.	To market and communicate to national, multi-national, community, business, and labor groups delivering activities designed to deliver messages that promote HIV prevention as well as improve the effectiveness of specific intervention efforts.  Prevention marketing and health communication activities frequently involve the integration of behavioral science, target population involvement, community participation, and social marketing principles in the design.  The focus in most of these efforts is on using social marketing and health communications to support social norms that foster HIV/AIDS workplace education prevention programs to encourage the adoption of behaviors that reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission.
11. 	 To disseminate information encompassing information on HIV/AIDS prevention in the workplace to both consumers and gatekeepers.  This is done through various mechanisms, including the operation of the Business and Labor Resource Service (BLRS).  The BLRS is a clearinghouse and contains the databases for all workplace materials programs, etc.   These services provide a variety of information and materials including CDC publications, brochures, posters, videos, access to scientific information published in various scientific journals, daily news summaries, access to information about national regional, state and local HIV/AIDS prevention service providers.

OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications - Commercial Items. The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. 52.212-2  EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS--OCT 1995 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL  CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT (ii)   PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)  PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is approximately equal  to Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate propo sals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b)	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Does the product literature and proposal offer a building where parts and materials can be interchanged Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technicall y unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neut ral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of p erformance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specif ied expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This procurement is for one solicitation resulting in the award of up to six Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)Multiple Award Construction Contracts (MACC) to the responsible proposers whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to award fewer than six contracts if sufficient number of acceptable proposals are not submitted to make awards.  The Government may consider volume of work under these contracts when requesting bids for new projects in order to affect an equitable distribution of work.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; to award the contract to other than the proposer submitting the lowest total price and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT EXCHANGES OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  The work will consist of new construction, additions, renovations, alterations and repairs to buildings and structures at Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, North Carolina.  Construction will include demolition, site work, concrete and masonry, carpentry, siding and roofing, doors and windows, interior and exterior finishes, mechanical and electrical work, and incidental related items.  Projects assigned to the IDIQ contracts will use the Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) approach to scope and price the work.  After award of the initial contract(s), up to six contractors, will compete for task orders based on best value, low price or low price technically acceptable to the Government.  The work will consist of demolition, total renovation of the interior and exterior of existing buildings, including repair and replacement of the structural, mechanical, electrical, and communication systems.  New construction and repair/renovation projects will require the following services; extensions to the existing high voltage electrical distribution system, extensions to the high pressure steam distribution system, extensions to the potable water distribution system, extensions to the sanitary sewer system, and additional storm water control systems.  The contract scope may also require removal of asbestos containing materials, lead containing paint and incidental related work.  Each contract will be for one base year with three one-year options.  The total 4-year (base year and three option years) not-to-exceed amount for each contract is $30,000,000.00.  Each contract has an annual value not to exceed $7,500,000.00.  Construction schedules will be determined for each project at the issuance of each task order.  The six best value contractors will be selected for the award of either the seed project or the award of one of the six contracts with a minimum guarantee of $10,000.00 to each successful offeror over the full term of the contract to include the option years.  The first IDIQ construction contract of the six will be awarded with a firm-fixed price, 100% design as the seed project.  This is a RFP, which requires submission of technical and price proposals.  Evaluation of award will be based on technical factors including (A) Past Performance, (B) Management and Organization, and (C) Support for Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Businesses.  Management and Organization has subfactors which are:  (1) Corporate Experience, (2) Quality Control and Key Personnel, (3) Safety and Health, and (4) Bonding Capability for projects of size and nature envisioned.  Support for Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Businesses has subfactors (1) Small Business Past Performance, and (2) Subcontracting Plan Effort.  It will also be based on pricing full plans and specifications for the seed project, N62470-03-D-0839, Repair Base Ops, Building 199, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, North Carolina, which has an estimated cost range of $250,000.00 to $500,000.00.  The work includes, in general terms, interior renovation of Debarkation and Check-In Rooms, mens' toilet (on 1st and 2nd levels), corridor (on 1st and 2nd levels) and stairs.  The Best Value Contractor of the six IDIQ contracts will be awarded the seed project with the initial award.  All six contractors will compete on subsequent task orders.  These subsequent projects will be non-complex performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design.  Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order, however, pricing will be weighted heavily.  The awarded task order will be a firm-fixed price task with a specific completion date.  Should the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth IDIQ Contractor be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award considerations may be modified in order to ensure each participating Contractor is awarded task orders meeting the minimum guarantee.  All initial awarded Contractors will be required to participate in all MACC walk-throughs, if required, and submit proposals.  Failure to participate responsibly in walk-throughs and failure to submit proposals on task orders may result in the Government not issuing additional task orders or exercising the option to extend the contract for an additional year.  The contract will be awarded to the best value offeror in accordance with the requirements of FAR Part 15.  Only the six selected Contractors will be permitted to propose on the task orders.  Proposals from another Contractor will not be accepted.  A minimum of two proposals will satisfy the competitive requirements of MACC and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the proposers is not able to participate in the process.  Failure to participate in the task order process may result in forfeiture of the minimum guarantee amount.  Seed project is unrestricted with a NAICS of 236220 and size standard of $28,500,000.  No public bid opening will be held.  A subcontracting plan is required, if the contract is awarded to a large business.  Plans and specifications will be available on or about 17 June 2003.  The estimated date for receipt of offers is on or about 17 July 2003.  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  It will be posted on the website at "http://esol.navfac.navy.mil".

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA  93042-5001 plans to use a Time and Material, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to procure on an other than full and open competition basis Contractor Engineering Technical Services (CETS) to various fleet and shore activities for the Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Command (NATEC) from Hamilton Sundstrand, One Hamilton Road, Windsor Locks, CT 06096-1010.  Hamilton Sundstrand is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the equipment to be supported.   This effort includes informing, instructing and training Navy Personnel in the installation, operation and maintenance of the T54460-1 Propeller systems used with T56-A-series –10/-14/-25/-427 engines installed on P3, C-2, E-2C, and C130 Aircraft.  Additionally, this task will provide service on the NP2000 eight bladed propeller system to be installed on the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 aircraft.  The effort will be performed at NATEC facilities in Norfolk, VA.  The tasks support the organizational and intermediate levels of maintenance for the engine and propeller systems.  The OEM, Hamilton Sundstrand, is the only source with ready access to technical databases of the T54460-1 and the eight bladed NP2000 propeller systems in their current configuration. For the NP 2000, factory engineering technical services up until Fleet support date is essential to ensure that technical information and maintenance procedures are updated on a timely basis. Hamilton Sundstrand is the only source with the technical support personnel capable and familiar with the systems able to perform the services including developing solutions to problems not readily resolved in the field.  No other firm possesses the required data and technical representatives with expertise on these systems. The government does not possess the required data, knowledge of equipment modifications, or engineering expertise, which precludes the use of a competitive procurement.  A one-year base period with four one-year option periods is anticipated.  Award of a contract is expected on 1 October 2003 and the contract will continue through 30 September 2008 if all options are exercised.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  Send responses to: Attn: Gary Trimble, Point Mugu Contracts Department, Code 230000E, NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 575 “I” Avenue, Suite 1, BLDG 65, Point Mugu, CA  93042-5049. See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Proposals (OAM-2003-N-0003).  This combined synopsis/solicitation is organized in eight parts:  (1) Background and Specific Requirements; (2) Cost Proposals; (3) Format and Instructions for Technical Proposal, (4) Technical Evaluation Criteria; (5) Applicability of Federal Acquisition Regulation Provisions, (6) Technical Questions and Mandatory Line of Sight Testing,  (7) Point of contact and (8) Submission of Offers.

1.  BACKGROUND AND REQUIREMENTS:  The General Accounting Office delivers training through a variety of methods, including in house classroom instruction, computer-based and other self-paced training and external programs.  In order to help meet the growing requirements of professional development for both evaluator and support staff, GAO added another delivery method: interactive, instructional television (ITV).  This method has offered GAO the following benefits: greater availability and convenience of external courses delivered directly to GAO classrooms, with the opportunity for “just in time training” on desired topics taught by experts in the field, live, direct interaction between an instructor and trainees, located at different sites.  GAO initiated an instruction television effort in September of 1993 via microwave transmissions to its classrooms at its 441 G Street NW, Washington, DC headquarters building.  Since that time we had numerous program offerings with participant groups ranging in number from as small as seven (7) participants to as large as 100 plus participants in numerous classrooms.  The term of the requirement is a base period (date of contract award through September 30, 2004) and four (4) renewable option years.  All equipment and support services are to be in place and ready for operational use by GAO within thirty (30) calendar days after the award of contract.  Programming is to be delivered on an as-needed basis according to schedules published by the contractor or as mutually agreed. Requirements:  A copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) can be requested via e-mail Dannerp@GAO.gov or via fax number (202) 512-3999. 2. COST PROPOSAL:  Offerors are required to request via email: Dannerp@GAO.gov) or fax (202) 512-3999 a copy of the  pricing schedule. Failure to complete  and submit the pricing may exclude your offer from consideration. The Pricing Schedule will identify fixed rates over the five-year contract period.  Offeror must submit an original and four (4) copies as a separate document from the technical proposal. 3.  FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSALS:  The proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind the offeror.  Proposals must contain: (a) the name, address and telephone number of the offeror, (b) cost proposal (c) Representations and Certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (d) technical proposal (original and four copies) addressing the technical approach of how GAO's requirements will be satisfied.  Technical proposals should not exceed 25 pages.  Pages beyond 25 will not be considered. Offerors that fail to furnish required representation and certifications or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from further consideration.  4. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items).  This is a best value procurement.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.

This acquisition is for continuing work for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Building and Fire Research Laboratory, Polymeric Material Group. The Polymeric Materials Group participates in and helps to maintain and advance the capabilities of a solar spectral ultraviolet (UV) network that has been established at eight locations throughout the United States.  The network is a joint research activity with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), the USDA UV-B Program, the Forest Products Laboratory at Madison, WI, and has been on-going for about six years.  This is an enhancement 
of on-going research which includes erecting a weathering station at one of the network sites and collecting weather data (total solar radiation, wind velocity, precipitation, relative humidity, and barometric pressure) to coincide with the solar UV-radiometer measurements, and to analyze, format, graph, and broadcast this data along with the spectral solar UV data to NIST and SERC in near real time via a satellite connection.  The accumulated knowledge will become a NIST Standard Reference Data Product and will be conveyed to the public via an international symposium and peer review publications.  K-Systems combined expertise in solar UV radiation measurements and data collection; its long history of interacting and responding to the needs of the service life prediction community in which this information will be utilized; and the fact that K-Systems has written all of the original computer code for the spectral ultraviolet measurements to which the new code will be appended has positioned K-Systems in a unique position to expedite the completion of these requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received on or before June 30, 2003, will be considered by the Government. No RFQ package is available.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL)  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with Allen Scientific Glass Inc., 1752 55th Street, Bolder, CO  80301 to provide a quantity of 620 air sampling flasks.  CMDL operates a global air sampling network to measure the distribution and variations of climatically important trace gases (CO2, CH4, CO, H2, N2O, SF6) and stable isotopic ratios (13C/12C, 18O/16O).  Whole air samples are collected in glass flasks sealed by means of Teflon O-ring stopcocks.  Because these gases are long-lived and well-mixed in the atmosphere, the spatial and temporal variations are relatively small.  This requires that the measurements be extremely accurate and precise, on the order of 0.03% for CO2.  To obtain the needed levels of accuracy and precision, the air sample composition must not change (gain or loss of any trace gas molecules) during storage in the flasks over time periods ranging from a few weeks to 1.5 years.  Any changes in the materials or methods used in our measurements require time-consuming testing to insure that artifacts or offsets are not introduced into the existing long time series.  Subtle artifacts could lead to erroneous interpretation of the data.  The flasks shall be 2.5 liters in size with Glass Expansion, Ltd. (GE) Teflon O-ring stopcocks.  It must be known or demonstrated that the flasks do not alter the trace gases of interest over the time periods specified.  The flasks must meet the following stability requirements over a 2 month storage period:  for CO2 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.07 ppm; CH4 the maximum allowed deviation is 2.0 ppb; CO the maximum allowed deviation is 1 ppb; H2 the maximum allowed deviation is 10 ppb; N2O the maximum allowed deviation is 0.4 ppb; SF6 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.06 ppt; 13C/12C the maximum allowed deviation is 0.01 per mil (parts per thousand); 180/160 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.05 per mil.  Due to the mandated expansion of NOAA's atmospheric carbon observing system, the time required for storing and testing any other flasks is not possible. The extensive tests, done over several months, (after receiving the flasks) to make sure they do not affect the gases of interest and are compatible with our existing 5000 flasks, would cause a gap in the collecting of the air samples.  Because of these requirements, Allen Scientific Glass is uniquely qualified to supply these flasks.  Compatibility of their flasks with current stock is essential to maintain reliability of the measurements of the gases within the mandated time frame for this project and have been proven over time.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000).  FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/ .  This synopsis is issued for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Governments best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date will be June 23, 2003.

<DESC>This Modification to Presolicitation Notice 72732 provides the following questions and answers to all potential Offerors: Question 1:	Could you specify which official receipt time will be considered for this RFQ?  Alaska or Herndon? Answer 1:	The official time is for Herndon, VA--Eastern Standard Time. Question 2:	In regards to task 3 of this presolicitation notice, do you have a rough map of the intended study area? Answer 2:	The estimate of the amount of habitat is not for the total overwintering habitat on the whole Beaufort coast but an estimate of the areas in the representative sample of the contractor's choosing.   They are to estimate the amount of habitat in a sample of  individual pools they identify in the SAR and then field verify that particular sample to determine if it is really overwintering habitat and how well the actual area compares can be estimated from the SAR image.  Again, this will be just in the areas the contractor plans to sample in.  [The following is a description of] the universe from which the Contractor would choose the samples:  North to South, it would be from 5 miles inland (Where ice roads to offshore development would be located) to 5 or so miles offshore where the edge of the grounded shorefast ice is likely to be.  East-west it would be in Beaufort Sea coastal rivers large enough to have potential overwintering and it is up to the contractor to propose their own sampling scheme.  In sum, SAR images covering a north-south distance of 10 or so miles near the mouth of one or more of these major rivers that they choose to sample.

<DESC>Air Force Manpower and Innovation Agency, Air Force Manpower Requirements Utilization Squadron, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas is seeking GSA sources capable of providing a commercial off the shelf (COTS) management scheduling and tracking software tool similar to the Air Force Manpower Office Scheduling Tool (AFMOST) requirements.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only.  This information will be used in conducting market research to identify potential GSA sources and commercial products, and obtain prices.

There will be three levels of organization with approximately 3000 users.  The upper two levels of organization (Higher Headquarters and Major Command (MAJCOM) will have the ability to task downwards and view all organizations under their purview.  The bottom level will have the ability to self-task, receive taskings from higher headquarters and view their respective tasks.  Regardless of the method of development, the end result will be a software tool housed at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas and accessible only to authorized users via the Internet.  System Requirements: (1) Must be Web-based; (2) Must comply with Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card regulatory requirements for program log-on; (3) The following is a list of data the program must capture and track by associated unit (e.g., Higher Headquarters, MAJCOM, or Base Level): Organizational Name, Major Command Name, Higher Headquarters Name, Category of Work, Task Name, Task Duration, Number of Assigned Personnel, Personnel Utilization Rate by Organization, Graphical Task Status Indicator, Task Percent Complete, Start and Finish Dates, Adjusted Start and Adjusted Finish Dates, Suspense Date, Fractional Manpower Associated by Task and Totalized by Organization; (4) Report views must be customizable by selecting one or more of the inputted fields above.  Reports must provide a visual representation of the information selected for each report; and (5) Must provide an automated historical transaction log of all actions made by task to include user-defined notes.  System Compatibility: The application must be compatible with Air Force computer systems and comply with DoD and Air Force policies.

THEREFORE OFFERORS INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERM.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and renovation by design-build or (to a lesser extent) design-bid-build of Fire Protection works at various locations within the Southwest Division area of responsibility, including but not limited to, Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico.

Offerors may offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s) (A-E), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months (or earlier as determined by the Contracting Officer after the government orders the maximum per contract amount of $3,000,000).  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months or a value of $3,000,000, whichever occurs first.  The task order range for this contract is between $50,000 and $3,000,000.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee, under the basic performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Two Phase Design-Build procedures of FAR 36.3 will be used for this procurement.  Phase One of the solicitation is in accordance with FAR Part 36.3.  Phase One evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors.  These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase Two proposal.  The maximum number of Offerors that will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal is eight (8).  Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals by the Offerors selected in Phase One, which will be evaluated separately in accordance with Part 15.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  The Government reserves the right to substitute or add other Design-Build projects that meet the scope of the MACC, prior to the receipt of Phase Two proposals.  Selection for award will be based evaluation of the following:  Phase One:  Factor 1 - Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 3 - Technical Approach.  Phase Two:  Factor 4 - Engineering Solutions of Offeror's Team; Factor 5 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  Proposed Task Order 0001 is to provide all labor and materials necessary to design and construct a fire alarm and fire suppression system for an occupied BEQ building.  This PTO is representative of the projects that may be procured through this contract.  The estimated price range for Task Order 0001 is between $100,000 and $250,000.

 The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Institute for Healthcare Research and Policy, Washington DC.
Purpose:
The Washington Circle (WC) is a ad hoc group of national experts in substance use disorders, managed care, and performance measurement in both the public and private sectors, who seek to improve the quality and effectiveness of substance use treatment services through the use of performance measurement systems.  This group was convened by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in March 1998, and has set forth two major goals to (1) develop and pilot test a core set of performance measures for substance abuse treatment for public and private sector health plans and (2) collaborate with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure widespread adoption of substance abuse performance measures by private employers, public payers and accrediting organizations.

The development, testing, and implementation of public/private performance measures is a complex task for a number of reasons and has and will take a number of years to be effective.  Adult performance measurement is new to the substance abuse field.  Both addictions and mental health lag behind other areas of health care in developing performance measures and incorporating them into evaluation and monitoring systems.  Performance measurement for children and adolescents shows even more significant gaps.  
 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS. AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>Modify description by adding correct Agency, so it reads as:

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Duke University Medical Center, Durham NC.
Purpose:
CERTs is an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) program whose mission is to conduct research and provide education that will advance the best use of therapeutics (drugs, medical devices, and biological products).  The evaluation of medical devices poses challenges that are different from those encountered in the evaluation of drugs.  In the evaluation of diagnostic imaging technologies many added complexities are raised.   

A two-day Conference is needed to develop a research agenda for the CERTs that will extend their current focus to two areas of special interest to the Medicare program: evaluation of medical devices and the evaluation of diagnostic imaging technologies. These two areas account for large portions of new medical innovations as well as large portions of the current and future health care budget.  
 
This workshop would bring together a select group of experts knowledgeable about a particular topic from a variety of perspectives (such as academia, consumer, government, health care practitioner, medical products industry) to answer important questions related to the study and use of medical devices.  The goal of the proposed conference is to develop specific short and long term research agendas in these areas that can form the basis for initial work of one or more CERTS.
 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO

ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

The Office of Emergency Preparedness (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Duke University Medical Center, Durham NC.
Purpose:
CERTs is an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) program whose mission is to conduct research and provide education that will advance the best use of therapeutics (drugs, medical devices, and biological products).  The evaluation of medical devices poses challenges that are different from those encountered in the evaluation of drugs.  In the evaluation of diagnostic imaging technologies many added complexities are raised.   

A two-day Conference is needed to develop a research agenda for the CERTs that will extend their current focus to two areas of special interest to the Medicare program: evaluation of medical devices and the evaluation of diagnostic imaging technologies. These two areas account for large portions of new medical innovations as well as large portions of the current and future health care budget.  
 
This workshop would bring together a select group of experts knowledgeable about a particular topic from a variety of perspectives (such as academia, consumer, government, health care practitioner, medical products industry) to answer important questions related to the study and use of medical devices.  The goal of the proposed conference is to develop specific short and long term research agendas in these areas that can form the basis for initial work of one or more CERTS.
 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

This synopsis is modified to state that the streamlined cost comparison study was completed on May 27, 2003, not May 26, 2003, as stated in the synopsis posted on June 3, 2003.  Synopsis should read as follows:

SUBJECT: TENTATIVE DECISION OF STREAMLINED COST COMPARISON STUDY UNDER OMB CIRCULAR A-76, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER 
Pursuant to OMB Circular A-76, on April 17, 2003 public notification was made to announce the streamlined cost comparison study of the DHHS/PSC/AOS, Division of Technical Support, Telecommunications Branch, located in Rockville, MD and Washington DC.  On May 27, 2003, the streamlined cost comparison study was completed and the Contracting Officer announced the tentative decision that the performance of the functions and operations of the Telecommunications Branch should remain in-house (performance by incumbent Government personnel totaling 15  FTEs).  This announcement starts the Public Review Period, wherein the public has an opportunity to review the documents that were used in the cost comparison.  The public review period will last for 20 calendar days from the date of this announcement (ending on June 23, 2003).  During the public review period, the documents will be available at the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Parklawn Building – Room 5-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland, 20857.  As a result of reviewing the documents, interested parties who believe an error was made in the cost comparison may file an appeal with the Contracting Officer.  Appeals must be filed in writing no later than the end of the public review period, 5:00 PM EST June 23, 2003.  Appeals must (1) be in writing – no special form required; (2) be submitted on time to the Contracting Officer (ATTN: Michele Trotter) at the referenced address above; (3) involve costing issues or noncompliance with OMB Circular A-76 procedures that govern the streamlined cost comparison process.  The designated Administrative Appeals Authority will, within thirty (30) days, review and make a decision regarding any submitted appeals. Upon resolution of any appeals received, a Final Decision on the streamlined cost comparison study shall be made and posted accordingly.

<DESC>This IS a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (Sources Sought Synopsis).  This IS NOT a SOLICITATION.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking sources capable of developing an occupational database for use in SSA’s disability programs (under Titles II and XVI), which encompass the disability evaluation process and SSA’s work opportunity and employment support initiatives. In its regulations, SSA takes administrative notice of reliable job information available from various governmental and other publications [20 CFR 404.1566(d) and 416.966(d)]. SSA currently uses the Dictionary of Occupational Titles Revised 4th Edition (DOT) and its companion publication, Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles (SCO), published by the Department of Labor (DOL) as the primary sources of information about jobs, job requirements, and the existence of work in the national economy.  In addition, SSA's regulatory guidelines are based on DOT constructs and definitions. For example, they define sedentary, light and medium strength work in the same way it is defined in the DOT/SCO. However, DOL has not formally updated the DOT/SCO since 1991 and has no plans to do so. Instead, DOL is developing an entirely new system, the Occupational Information Network, or O*NET. This system is useful for career and educational exploration and planning, but it does not provide the type of data required for disability claim adjudication or vocational rehabilitation and job placement of persons with disabilities. Therefore, SSA is seeking sources capable of developing a new source of occupational data to replace the DOT for use in SSA’s disability programs. To develop this database, the source(s) must 1) identify the requirements of work that are most relevant to disability evaluation and vocational rehabilitation and job placement of persons with disabilities; 2) develop and validate job analysis instruments that measure these requirements of work; 3) develop and implement sampling methods and data collection plans needed to obtain a national representation of occupational information; 4) collect a national representation of occupational data and analyze results of data collection; 5) classify occupations according to the data collected; and 6) develop a database. SSA anticipates that this would be a multi-year effort and that the requirements of work would be defined in terms of observable and measurable descriptors.   If you feel your organization has the corporate capability and expertise for performing this type of service, provide the following information VIA EMAIL ONLY about your company:  (1) company or university name, address, email address, website address, point of contact and telephone number (2) corporate capability statement (not to exceed 2 pages) that includes similar experience and references.  This Request for Information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information based on this request for information is purely voluntary.   SSA plans to make a solicitation available at FEDBIZOPPS at a later date.  If a solicitation is posted, it will be preceded by a presolicitation announcement that will specify an anticipated solicitation issuance date sometime in 2003.  Any questions should be submitted via EMAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer at bridget.hamel@ssa.gov.

<DESC>This is a request for information (Sources Sought Synopsis). This is not a solicitation. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking sources capable of providing the Agency with a revised and updated version of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles Revised 4th Edition (DOT) and its companion publication, Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles (SCO), published by the Department of Labor (DOL). SSA relies on these publications for its disability evaluation process and work opportunity and employment support initiatives.  In its regulations, SSA takes administrative notice of reliable job information available from various governmental and other publications [20 CFR 404.1566(d) and 416.966(d)]. SSA currently uses the DOT and the SCO as the primary sources of information about jobs, job requirements, and the existence of work in the national economy.  In addition, SSA's regulatory guidelines are based on DOT constructs and definitions. For example, they define sedentary, light and medium strength work in the same way it is defined in the DOT/SCO. However, DOL has not formally updated the DOT/SCO since 1991 and has no plans to do so. Instead, DOL is developing an entirely new system, the Occupational Information Network, or O*NET. This system is useful for career and educational exploration and planning, but it does not provide the type of data required for disability claim adjudication or vocational rehabilitation and job placement of persons with disabilities. Therefore, SSA is seeking an existing occupational database that has been updated to provide the same type of data shown in the DOT/SCO, which SSA can use while developing alternative sources of occupational data. The database must:  1) currently exist (SSA is not interested in developing such a database for interim use); 2) utilize the same constructs and definitions as the DOT/SCO; 3) contain the complete set of descriptors found in the DOT/SCO; 4) contain information on work found in the national economy that is more recent than the 1991 version of the DOT/SCO; 5) be representative of work found in the national economy; and 6) have been developed in a statistically valid, reliable and defensible manner. If you feel your organization has the corporate capability and expertise for performing this type of service, provide the following information via E-MAIL ONLY about your company: 1) company or university name, address, e-mail address, website address, point of contact, and telephone number, 2) corporate capability statement (not to exceed 2 pages) that includes similar experience and references, 3) name of the database, and 4) the source of data. This request for information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information is based on this request or information is purely voluntary. SSA may make a solicitation available at FEDBIZOPPS at a later date. If a solicitation is posted, it will be preceded by a presolicitation announcement that will specify an anticipated solicitation issue date sometime in 2003.

DEVELOP, INSTALL, INTEGRATE AND MAINTAIN BAR CODING OF CASE FILES.  Sources Sought -- The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a requirement for technical services, to be performed in the Santa Ana, CA, area to support the HUD Santa Ana Homeownership Center (SAHOC) processing of case files through bar coding of case binders.  

Services for the past three years have been provided through a lease of equipment and program systems modified to capture data from HUD systems (CHUMs) and provide bar code labels.  The labels are then scanned into a database facilitating tracking of the case binders at all times.  The current lease is expiring and HUD seeks to either renew the lease or obtain another source that can provide the same services.  While currently working in a Windows 95 environment, HUD is converting to Windows XP this year, and any system used must work in the new environment.  A new system will also be required to integrate all existing information into any new database.  Interested vendors may view the draft work statement at www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/contract/den01820.cfm on or after June 5, 2003.

At this time, HUD has not determined whether to solicit on a small business set-aside basis, an unrestricted basis (i.e. all business types).  A decision will be made after reviewing the responses to this notice.  Large businesses interested in this notice must express their intent to subcontract at least 40% of the work to small businesses.  For purposes of determining size status, NAICS code 53229, with $6M in average annual receipts, will be used.  

Interested parties must notify the Contract Specialist and provide the requisite information via email at the following address: Michael_J._Mee@hud.gov.  With the email notification of interest, parties shall provide 1) their qualifications sufficient to ascertain the vendor may be able to perform the requirements stated above, including specific identification of the product proposed and salient characteristics, 2) identification as to whether the vendor is large or small and, if large, intent to subcontract 40% or more, and 3) if applicable, the vendor's GSA schedule number.  Do not submit a company overview or unnecessarily elaborate materials; submissions should not exceed ten standard pages when printed.  Interested parties must respond no later than 4:00 pm Mountain Time, June 11, 2003.  Vendors who do not provide the mandatory information will not be considered.  Vendors may be requested to provide a product demonstration prior to solicitation.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought for small business contractors that would have an interest in participating in a Fleet and Industrial Supply Center procurement for overflow habitability work aboard US Naval vessels, if and when the requirement is so identified.   Overflow habitability work is defined as habitability supplies and services in support of US Naval vessels within a 50 mile radius of NOB Norfolk and is further defined as work that can’t be accomplished via existing contract vehicles due to sheer volume or other reasons. 

Interested contractors will have a successful past performance record and be thoroughly familiar with the NAVSEA material, fabrication, and installation requirements for various furnishings and fixtures relative to shipboard habitability spaces (mess areas, wardrooms, berthing areas, offices, etc.) on US Naval Vessels.   In addition, change orders are rarely, if ever, issued, thus making it even more imperative that contractors be thoroughly familiar with the work to be accomplished to preclude a flawed price proposal.  

The required work demands a high degree of quality as it relates directly to shipboard quality of life.  Material requirements are driven by Mil-Std-1623, and fabrication and installation by the various NAVSEA directives such as the General Specification for Ships of the US Navy (GENSPEC) and the General Specification for Overhaul of Surface Ships (GSO).   

Interested small business contractors would already have, or be willing to establish, a manufacturing and assembly area for habitability furnishings and fixtures to be located within a 50 mile radius of Naval Base, Norfolk,Virginia.  Companies would be capable of performing 51% or more of the required work.   

A habitability renovation aboard a US Naval vessel could consist of any combination of the following, including a myriad of other tasks not identified herein;  Various bulkhead treatments (vinyl wall covering or High Pressure Plastic Laminate (HPPL)), deck replacement or repair, furniture fabrication (sofas, chairs, various cabinetry in the form of desks, bookcases, entertainment centers, mess deck tables, stainless steel beverage counters, salad and hot bars, etc.), carpet installation, and false overheads aboard a US Navy vessel.


Interested contractors should reply to this sources sought via e-mail to the following;

<SUBJECT>99 -- NOTICE to all Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) Vendors Regarding New Electronic Submission of Payment Requests
<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) has issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-398).  Section 108 requires contractors to electronically submit all requests for payment under DoD contracts.  This rule also requires DeCA to electronically process requests for payments and any supporting documentation.  DFARS Clause 252.232-7003 entitled Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (MAR 2003) can be viewed in its entirety by using the following link:  http://www.acq.osd.mil/dp/dars/dfars/html/r20030331/252232.htm#252.232
In order to comply with the above rule, DeCA will be implementing two new software-based systems, Electronic Document Access (EDA) and Wide Area Workflow (WAWF), by October 1, 2003.
The first system, EDA, will act as a virtual (electronic) file cabinet for the storage and retrieval of contract documents used by multiple DoD activities.  EDA will replace the paper process and allow authorized user(s) access to the virtual file cabinet after completing the registration process.  For additional information, go to http://eda.ogden.disa.mil.
The second system, WAWF, is an automated system that allows vendors to electronically submit invoices and receiving reports and DeCA to inspect, accept, receive and pay electronically.  This process eliminates the time associated with mailing and processing documents.  All documentation arrives securely and on-time at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service’s (DFAS) payment office.  For additional information, go to https://rmb.ogden.disa.mil.
The Director of Finance and his staff have partnered with our agency to ensure successful implementation of the application for our DeCA vendors.  They are looking forward to working with you.  Technical questions regarding the system should be addressed to the WAWF-RA (Wide Area Workflow—Receipt and Acceptance) Customer Service Center at (800) 392-1798.  Questions regarding your DeCA contract or appropriate data to enter into WAWF-RA should be addressed to Daria Finley at (703) 681-2147 or Kyle Bond at (703) 681-1239.  Payment questions should be addressed to Jay Fitzsimonds at (317) 510-1731 or Kim Pisall at (703) 602-8780.

Successful implementation of EDA is essential before the benefits of WAWF can be realized.  Therefore, it is CRUCIAL that DeCA’s vendors be registered for BOTH EDA and WAWF.  

The DeCA Notice to Vendors contains information regarding necessary steps to accomplish registration.
Complete the DeCA Vendor Maintenance Form prior to CCR registration/update, EDA and WAWF-RA registration.
DUNS number(s) and CAGE code(s) are required for the EDA Access Authorization Form.
Every user of WAWF-RA must self-register on the WAWF-RA website which can be accessed at https://rmb.ogden.disa.mil/servelt/selfreg

[CDKSDC PROJECT

PANELS SPECIFICATIONS


NOTICE

A portion of this project includes the construction of a sliding interlock to prevent the closure of certain breakers at the same time. This feature is an important life safety function that must be accomplished with no errors and very close tolerances. Because of this safety consideration all components constructed will be subjected to stringent quality control measures to ensure compliance with the specifications. Units not meeting the standards set forth in this specification and accompanying drawings are subject to rejection and return to the vendor for modification or new construction. 


a)	Panels shall be constructed of .125” gauge aluminum in accordance with drawings numbered CEMR021303-001 and CEMR021303-002.

b)	All inside seams, where applicable, will be seal welded.

c)	If necessary, participating vendors will be afforded the opportunity to view and take measurements of the prototype end item equipment to assist in the process of providing a valid offer. Drawings will be provided to participating vendors electronically using AutoCad version R14 or 2000. A vendor requiring printed copies of the drawings may obtain them, at their own expense, from Gulf Coast Blueprints in downtown Panama City by requesting the “Tyndall CDKSDC Project” set of plans.

d)	Measurements tolerance shall be limited to +/- 1/16”. Prior to construction the selected vendor will travel to Tyndall AFB to view and take his/her own measurements from the prototype unit located at building 1134. Measurements on the accompanying panel drawings are for reference only and will not be used for construction. 

e)	Breaker cover panel cutouts must be accomplished using computer controlled water jet technology. This eliminates distortion due to heat.

f)	Panels shall be constructed, painted, and delivered at the rate of two sets per week beginning two weeks after contract award.

g)	Panels shall be painted to match surrounding enclosure (flat olive drab) using the powder coating method. Vendor obtaining the contract will be provided a painted piece of material with which to match color hues. Finish shall be provided with a satin (flat) finish.
 

BUSBAR SPECIFICATIONS

a)	Bus bars must be manufactured in accordance with drawing number CEMR021303-003.

b)	Bus bar configurations will be provided to participating vendors electronically using AutoCad version R14 or 2000. A vendor requiring printed copies of the drawings may obtain them, at their own expense, from Gulf Coast Blueprints in downtown Panama City by requesting the “Tyndall CDKSDC Project” set of plans.

c)	Bus bar stock will be provided by the customer to the contractor as needed.

d)	Bus bar must be bent to the required angles by incorporating the use of a power brake with a .25” radius die. Bending by any other means is unacceptable. Dimensions tolerance will be limited to +/- 1/32”. 

e)	Bus bar sets shall be delivered at the rate of two sets per week.]
