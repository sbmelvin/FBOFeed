<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>U.S. CBP is replenishing, up grading and expanding its fielding of less lethal force devices.  CBP would consider equipment that is comparable in form, quality, and munitions delivery to its current arsenal and acceptable for tactical requirements similar to the FN303 System.  This potential procurement will also support the requirements of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement group of the Department of Homeland Security.  The less lethal launcher system should also provide capabilities specific to fit a tactical requirement as to safe range, effective range, maximum effective range, on target accuracy, muzzle velocity, kinetic impact and projectile characteristics and payload.  The less lethal launcher must weigh no more than 2.3 kg empty and no more than 2.7 kg load with a suitable magazine.  The launcher must not exceed 74 cm (29 inches) in length with stock extended and barrel length should be 25cm (10 inches).   Launcher should be capable of mounting optional sights by a Picatinny rail or comparable feature and have a durable exterior material of metal, polymer or similar material that presents an appearance associated with law enforcement and military tactical weaponry.  The launcher must be magazine fed and have a magazine of at least 15 projectiles.  The launcher system should be compress gas powered with a compress gas bottle attached to the launcher that does not obstruct the operator’s vision or restrict movement.  The compress air bottle must be relied upon to discharge at least 100 shots.  The launcher must fire projectiles with muzzle velocity of 85 to 91 m/s; deliver the projectile at 280 to 300 FPS and an Energy (EO/E5) rate of 24.5 to 16.1 ft/lbs to deliver the projectile for maximum kinetic impact.  Any launcher should have a safe range of at least one meter.  Launcher must accurately fire the specified projectiles where as a reasonably trained operator will accurately acquire an adult human target effectively at 50 meters and have a maximum range of at least 100 meters.  The associated projectile should be 18mm/68 cal rounds weighing approximately 8.5 gram with any payload.  A fin-stabilized projectile of high impact polymer outer material is preferred.  Projectile should be fully effective for maximum kinetic impact by at least 30 meters and be tested for reliable accurate delivery by a competent operator at 50 meters.  Launcher system and projectile should have a maximum effective range of 100 meters.  Projectile impact should be reasonably expected to impact a suspect between 30 to 100 meters between10 to 30 joules.  Projectiles must be available in inert training and marking rounds and live chemical rounds.  Live chemical rounds should be similar in nature to the PAVA (pelargonic acid and vanillyamid powder) and immediately effect ocular swelling and burning sensation in the eyes and the respiratory tract. Chemical must be a product tested by federal law enforcement agencies and currently in use for the control of resistant, combative and fleeing subjects.  Launcher system must be easily portable, be capable of fitting with a tactical sling; parts and magazines should be uniform.  Any offeror that believes they have a product(s) that can meet the above may submit information by e-mail (only) to Rick Travis at richard.travis@dhs.gov not later than 24 February 2009. The information must be sufficient to determine that the offeror’s capabilities to produce the above noted equipment. This synopsis is intended for information and planning purposes only and the government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. Based upon responses received, the government reserves to determine the format for solicitation.
