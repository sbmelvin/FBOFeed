<DESC>NSN 2540-01-538-9060, Armor Set, Supplemental. This material is being procured in accordance with CAGE 19207 Drawing 12531462. The required quantity is 17 KT with a 100% option to be shipped to DODACC (SW3120) Anniston, AL 36201. The required delivery is 200 days. FOB origin and Inspection and Acceptance at origin are required. This solicitation is set-aside for small business. This material is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested suppliers may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with the commercial item with 15 days of this notice. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of August 18, 2017 (08/18/17). Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. <br />Technical drawings/bid sets will be available after the issue date on the Internet at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and Federal Specifications and Standards, Qualified Products Lists, Military Handbooks, and other standardization documents from ASSIST-Quick Search, http://quicksearch.dla.mil/. Documents not available for downloading from ASSIST can be ordered from the DODSSP Special Assistance Desk at (215)697-6396/6257 (DSN: 442-6396/6257), Bldg. 4/D, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5094.

Direct access to defense and federal specifications, standards, and related standardization documents is available on the Internet via http://assist.dapsmil or http://www.dodssp.daps.mil. <br />While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, proposals will be evaluated according to "best value" procedures on the basis of Price, Past Performance, and Delivery. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. <br />Tailored ISO 9001 certification is required. <br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. Preferred method to submit proposal is to upload through Dibbs. Submit e-mailed proposals to Kristina.Wolf@dla.mil. E-mailed proposals cannot exceed 15MB.

<p><br />The National Institute of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC) intends to award a one year fixed price purchase order to American Association of Blood Banks, Inc.

<p>Blood and blood products such as red blood cells leuko reduced, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelets pheresis leuko reduced are critical to support the mission of the NIH CC, Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM).

<p>American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) is uniquely qualified due to its affiliation with blood centers nationwide to locate and obtain blood from blood centers with surplus inventory to alleviate regional blood shortages that can't be managed by local or even regional blood suppliers. AABB relies on a nationwide network of FDA licensed blood facilities with a surplus of blood and blood components. There is no other known blood supplier that possesses a nationwide network clearinghouse that enables the association to become a resource-sharing network. There is 24/7 access to the AABB team who is ready to assist with locating and shipping blood components at all times.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities. Capability Statements must be received within the time set forth in this synopsis to be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisition, Contracts Management Branch Blue, on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate and award a contract to Quest Diagnostics, Nichols Institute, Inc., 14225 Newbrook Drive, Chantilly, VA 20151, for reference clinical laboratory services in support of the NIA HANDLs study.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 621511 with a Size Standard of $32.5 million.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses of the Federal acquisition Requlation (FAR) in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-95, dated January 19, 2017.</p>
<p>STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br />This acquisition is conducted as non-competitive under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Project Title: Reference clinical laboratory services for the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for performing pre-analytic processing, analysis, and result interpretation for clinical and anatomical pathology specimens as requested by the NIA HANDLS physicians. Services shall include the transportation of clinical laboratory specimens to the contractor's laboratory(ies) (including providing the shipping/pickup containers), the performance of analytical testing as defined by the Contractor's reference test manual, the reporting of analytical test results and consultative services as required to assimilate the full scope of its laboratory operations to the ordering facility.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />This project is a continuation of a need that is currently provided under contract HHSN271201400124C, which expires June 30, 2018. These services have been provided via the incumbent since 2004. HANDLS is a longitudinal study in which participants are compared to one another and to themselves over time. Consistency in measurement is paramount because NIA HANDLS investigators must attribute any changes observed to changes in HANDLS participants, not to changes in the assays. Although repeatability is important for all measures in HANDLS, it is particularly crucial for clinical laboratory assays because these tests have specific reference ranges that define abnormal health conditions. Reference ranges vary among different vendors and each vendor is responsible via Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) program certification for developing and standardizing their own reference ranges. Consequently, it is crucial to maintain consistency by using the same laboratory facilities for performing HANDLS clinical assays. Not doing so would introduce unmeasurable error in our assessments of change over time that would invalidate estimates of variation associated with age, race, and socioeconomic status. Changes in methodology and reference ranges might also have untoward effects on HANDLS participants. Participants may provide these results to their physicians, who may inappropriately interpret changes in clinical status unless laboratory methods are consistent over time. Therefore, NIA requires an agreement with the current contractor.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />The period of performance will consist of one 12-month base period and three 12-month option periods as specified below:</p>
<p>Base Year: July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019<br />Option Year 1: July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2020<br />Option Year 2: July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2021<br />Option Year 3: July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022<br /><br />CLOSING STATEMENT<br />This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.

EST<br />A Solicitation will NOT be posted to Fed Biz Opps due to the sole source nature of this action. The draft agreement is anticipated to be issued directly to Raytheon Technical Services Company, LLC on or around 28 February 2018.<br />SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT - Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement to award a five-year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) for Repair, Upgrade, Rework and Maintenance as required for each Digital Radio Frequency Memory Unit (DFRMU), a major assembly of the AN/SLQ-32 Legacy System. The requirement will allow for DRFMU Repairs at the assembly and subassembly level and include upgrades for the DRFMU's and DRFMU component repairs and upgrades.

Delivery Orders shall be within scope, issued within ordering period, and be within the maximum total dollar value of approximately $8,150,000 over a five-year period. <br />The proposed IDIQ is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, Raytheon Technical Services Company, LLC., Indianapolis, IN, 46219-2058, CAGE 072E5 in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), only one responsible source. The basis for restricting competition is due to the lack of sufficient technical data and duplicative cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. The duplicative cost and delay are comprised from the cost to procure methodologies, data rights to test procedures/benches, and software/firmware rights required to test component functionality. <br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a SPP agreement, ACT agreement, or CRADA agreement.
<p>THE TECHNOLOGY:  <br />PNNL has developed a method of imaging the subsurface electrical conductivity distribution that removes the effects of the subsurface metallic structures, enabling more accurate assessment and execution of ERT imaging within industrial areas. ERT works by injecting current into the subsurface across a pair of electrodes and measuring the corresponding electrical potential response across another pair of electrodes. Many such measurements are strategically taken across an array of electrodes to produce an ERT data set. These data are then processed to produce an image of the subsurface conductivity structure. PNNL's E4D software applies a numerical correction to simulate the presence of metallic structures at known locations and dimensions. The method then removes the influence of these structures on the results to show a more accurate image. The process is flexible and customizable to a particular problem, making it suitable for both advanced research applications and more common imaging.</p>
<p>In addition to modeling the influence of metallic structures on the subsurface potential distribution, PNNL's method allows those structures to be used as current injection and/or potential measurement electrodes, thereby expanding ERT capabilities. The method can also model structures that are discontinuous in space, but electrically connected (for example, two or more buried tanks connected by above-ground transfer piping). Because PNNL's method enables ERT to focus on estimating soil conductivity, engineers have the opportunity to 1) accurately assess whether imaging in areas with dense metallic infrastructure is feasible, 2) determine what electrode configurations and survey geometries are required to effectively image in the presence of metallic infrastructure, and 3) significantly improve modeling capabilities in areas with conductive infrastructure. See additional information here. U.S. issued patent 9,772,423.</p>
<p>For all inquiries, please reference Battelle IPID 30608</p>
<p>NOTE:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than thirty (30) days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.

<p>THE TECHNOLOGY:</p>
<p>PNNL has developed methods for synthesizing nanocrystalline metal powders, comprising tungsten, molybdenum, rhenium or niobium, which are characterized by forming a combustion synthesis solution by dissolving in water an oxidizer, a fuel, and a base-soluble, ammonium precursor of tungsten, molybdenum, rhenium, or niobium in amounts that yield a soichiometric burn when combusted. The combustion synthesis solution is then heated to a temperature sufficient to substantially remove water and to initiate a self-sustaining combustion reaction. The resulting powder can be subsequently reduced to metal form by heating in a reducing gas environment. U.S. issued patents 9,283,637 and 9,802,834.</p>

PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a SPP agreement, ACT agreement, or CRADA agreement.
<p>THE TECHNOLOGY:</p>
<p>PNNL has developed a process yielding mass or bulk quantities of high purity (&gt;90%) low-temperature-phase manganese bismuth alloys suitable for the scalable production of permanent magnets. The method combines selected atomic ratios of manganese and bismuth metals in either an arc- or induction melter to form a stable composite alloy in the form of either an ingot or pellet. Using two temperature regimes with an oxygen-free or reducing gas environment, heat treatment, and particle size control results in a ferromagnetic material with coercivity values (the ability to maintain magnetic properties) that increase significantly with increasing temperatures.</p>
<p>The method for producing this high-purity alloy is an ideal candidate for use in electric devices, as well as other applications with elevated temperatures (above 100 degrees C). Specific areas include the following: Energy production with high efficiency (for example, wind turbines), electrical motors for vehicles, magnetic materials for military applications, and special high-temperature applications. See additional information here. U.S. issued patent 9,418,779.</p>

This data is stored within the Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS), and enables accurate Line of Sight (LOS) calculation. Without additional procurement of the FaCT, the F-15/16 pilots will not have JHMCS capability. A lack of the said capability could jeopardize the pilot's line of sight, degrade successful mission accomplishment and ultimately, compromise our national security.</span></p>

On a yearly basis we they use between 60,000 to 100,000 septa and require a very pure and non-contaminated product in order to assure reliable monitoring of targeted pests.</p>
<p><br />Last known Source: <br />West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.<br />101 Gordon Dr<br />Exton, PA 19341-1320</p>
<p><br />Background:<br />The gray septa is a rubber sleeve stopper used in the pharmaceutical industry for the capping of vials containing injectable drugs for human consumption, but the CAPS program uses them for vessels to hold pheromone for insect lures. The chemical makeup of the septa is optimal for pheromone absorption and retention in order to allow a controlled and slow release out in the field. The septa consist of an elastomeric formulation with a PIB type base polymer, a non-reactive ingredient, making up 0.5-4.2% by weight.</p>
<p>Objective:<br />Our production is seasonal, therefore we use our yearly supply of septa (about 100,000) within about 3-4 months in the winter through spring seasons. Our short lure production season and potentially looming emergency programs, i.e. previous Light Brown Apple Moth and European Grapevine Moth emergency programs, demands an adequate septa supply to insure our ability to meet expected and emergency lure demands for the CAPS program.</p>

<SUBJECT>IGF::OT::IGF Cle Elum Gate, Helix, and Intake.
<SOLNBR>140R1018R0016
<CONTACT>Gordon, Connie
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is conducting market research for the construction of an Intake Structure, Helix, and Gate Chamber at Cle Elum Dam.    

The principal components of work would include:

The Bureau of Reclamation wants to construct a combined Intake Structure, Gate and Helix Chamber which will consist of constructing the structural, mechanical and electrical systems inside of the previously constructed secant pile shaft in addition to a six-level intake structure in the reservoir to allow for downstream fish passage.

The Intake Structure consists of six reinforced concrete intake structures stacked vertically that follows the existing reservoir rim contours and allows water and fish to be drawn into the juvenile facility over a reservoir water surface fluctuation of 63 feet.  The water is controlled at each intake structure by an overflow weir crest gate.  The water then flows to the juvenile facility through precast concrete conduits that range in length from 500 feet to 50 feet with the longest length being the bottom intake.  The precast conduit transitions to a concrete encased steel pipe that penetrates through the secant pile shaft into the Gate Chamber.

The Gate Chamber houses an underground 6-story tall steel structure that supports the guard gate and steel pipe for each of the 6 intake levels within the previously constructed secant pile shaft.  The size of the Gate Chamber is to provide the hydraulics required for the steel pipe transition to the helix structure.  An access structure is provided in the Gate Chamber for entry and egress by a stairwell and elevator shaft.

The Helix Chamber houses an underground 48-foot diameter helix structure that dissipates the energy from transporting water and fish from a vertical distance of over 80 feet.  The structural support system for the helix is a steel braced frame system that supports a precast concrete flume used to transport the water and fish.  An access structure is provided in the center of the helix for entry and egress by a stairwell and elevator shaft.

The Gate and Helix Chambers are fully enclosed by a roof constructed with steel trusses and joists with a reinforced concrete deck.

Period of Performance is 3 years from award.  

The intent of this notice is to identify potential contractors to construct this requirement at Cle Elum Dam.  Interested offerors are invited to submit the following information:

Statement of interest as a prime and/or subcontractor
Point of contact information and company DUNS number
Size status and/or SBA certification program for NAICS 237990
Information on the ability to construct the above referenced structures.  

This market research is for informational purposes only. This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued, and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  No entitlement to payment will arise as a result of the submission of contractor information.  Any questions regarding this announcement should be sent to cgordon@usbr.gov no later than close of business on February 9, 2018.  Phone calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>Title of Project: Geospatial Research, Analysis and Services Program (GRASP)<br />Division of Toxicology and Human Health Sciences ATSDR
<p>Introduction: "This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. <br />The proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541370, Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services, with a size standard of $15M.<br />Background. Over the past 25 years, the public health community has come to recognize the importance of geospatial science, technology and visualization as applied to public health research and practice. GIS (geographic information system) science, technology and visualization have become essential in the examination of trends and patterns associated with infectious &amp; chronic disease, environmental exposure, and injury. More than just a mapping tool, GIS has become invaluable in understanding the context of emerging diseases, environmental exposures, and access to healthcare. GIS has become a transformative element in the public health toolbox.</p>
<p>GRASP, the Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program (Division of Toxicology and Human Health Sciences (DTHHS), ATSDR) is a program that provides ongoing GIS (geographic information system) science and technology support to Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response (OPHPR), and multiple other CIOs across CDC/ATSDR. The mission of GRASP is to provide leadership and expertise in the application of the concepts, methods, and tools of geography and geospatial information science to public health research and practice across CDC/ATSDR and among the public health community. GRASP objectives are to (1) research and analyze the geospatial trends and patterns relevant to diverse factors associated with environmental health, infectious and chronic disease, and emergency preparedness &amp; response, (2) geospatially enable CDC/ATSDR scientists and systems with data, consulting, technology, and training, (3) collaborate with scientists and researchers at the CDC/ATSDR and among our public health partners to address diverse public health issues, (4) contribute to a vibrant geospatial community among public health professionals, and (5) embrace, leverage and promote technology.</p>
<p>GRASP has grown and diversified to include 50+ staff (FTE/CONTRACT) with expertise in geography, GIS analysis, cartography, geospatial statistics, computer science, remote sensing, epidemiology, emergency preparedness &amp; response, and demography. GRASP is highly collaborative and promotes the integration of geography and geospatial science into public health, focuses on training and education, and emphasizes the importance of effective use of GIS technology to work with CDC/ATSDR and beyond to prevent disease, prolong life, and promote health. GRASP scientists work extensively with partners across the CDC/ATSDR and among the broader public health community. For example, GRASP worked with NCEH/Health Community Design Initiative to develop refined measures for the built-environment that were subsequently shared on the Environmental Public Health Tracking Portal (Dec 2012).</p>
<p>GRASP collaborated with the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) to better understand time and distance barriers to access cancer screening and treatment (2009 - Present). Additionally, GRASP has worked with the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) to design and build the NCHHSTP Atlas, the first web-based visualization tool ever released by the CDC to visualize state and county NCHHSTP surveillance data (released Jan 2011), and has worked with the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)/Influenza Division to enhance mapping that is integrated into routine influenza surveillance (2009 - Present). GRASP worked with Healthy People 2020 to develop a baseline metric for the Healthy People 2020 school siting measure (Dec 2010), and has integrated and supported mapping directly into CDC WONDER (2003- Present). In addition, since 2003, GRASP has provided all GIS technology and analytic support to the CDC Emergency Operations Center ("EOC"), which enables the CDC to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies and events of all kinds.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of the GRASP Geospatial Science, Technology, and Visualization IDIQ contract is to provide contractor support to complete geospatial science, technology, and visualization tasks that range from limited consultations to large, multi-year efforts requiring several contractors to complete. For example, a GIS technology task supported by this IDIQ contract may be require a full contract team for a period of 1 year to design, develop, test, and release an interactive atlas requiring extensive expertise in systems integration, design, application development, database programming, and coordination. Another example task supported by this contractor may require a single contractor for a period of 6 months to design and automate a set of GIS map templates which will be used by GRASP staff in a repeated manner. Another example task supported by this contract may require a single contractor for a period of 1 year to analyze GIS health care access data and draft a manuscript outlining analysis conclusions and recommendations for further study.</p>
<p><br />Scope of Work. The scope of the GRASP Geospatial Science, Technology, and Visualization IDIQ Contract includes the provision of contract support spanning multiple expertise areas required for GRASP to plan, deliver, support, and evaluate GIS projects for partners across the CDC/ATSDR and in the broader public health community.</p>
<p>Experience and Expertise Required<br />To perform the tasks GRASP envisions being associated with this IDIQ contract, the contractor must have expertise in GIS, geography, geospatial information science, cartography, data visualization, geospatial statistics, epidemiology, public health policy, computer science, systems integration, web/desktop application development, database design/development, UI/UX (user-interface/user-experience design), systems analysis, business process management, project management, data management, verbal/written technical communication. <br />Broad Communication and Collaboration Requirements<br />Contractors within GRASP are required to (1) interface with the diverse and multi-disciplinary GRASP staff to obtain clarity in requirements (if needed), and (2) communicate complex GIS science and technology concepts to GRASP staff and CDC/ATSDR staff who collaborate with GRASP on various projects. Thus, all GRASP contractors are required to have excellent oral and written communication skills.</p>
<p>Field Deployment Requirements<br />Contractors within GRASP will, on an as-needed basis, be required to travel for periods of 2 days to 3 months to (1) attend conferences, (2) attend partner meetings, and/or (3) provide field support in the area of GIS. Travel will be planned around individual contractor's respective personal schedules, plans, and responsibilities.</p>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of NIH, leads a broad scientific effort to understand the nature of aging and to extend the healthy, active years of life. The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) provides a stimulating setting for a comprehensive effort to understand aging through multidisciplinary investigator-initiated research, in this regard.</p>
<p>One of the IRP's program activities includes the Clinical Research Core (CRC) part of the NIA Clinical Unit within the Office of the Scientific Director. The CRC seeks to elucidate normative values and separate normal aging findings from disease states. The CRC's goal is to prolong disease-free states with age. The CRC serves as an infrastructure to facilitate the creation and development of therapeutic targets for the treatment of age-related disease across the Intramural Research Program. The CRC performs research that has direct clinical applications to aging and disease states and, as such, collects participant specimens depending on the testing procedures required per protocol study. The NIA CRC requires reference clinical laboratory services, including but not limited to hormone assays, for these participant specimens. The lab results become official documentation of the participant's medical record.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this acquisition is to procure clinical laboratory services.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:<br />The Contractor shall be responsible for performing pre-analytic processing, analysis, and result interpretation for clinical and anatomical pathology specimens as requested by the NIA Clinical Unit physicians. Services shall include the transportation of clinical laboratory specimens to the contractor's laboratory(ies) if off-site from the NIA Clinical Unit (including providing the shipping/pickup containers), the performance of analytical testing as defined by the Contractor's reference test manual, the reporting of analytical test results and consultative services as required to assimilate the full scope of its laboratory operations to the ordering facility.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: Base year (12 months) plus 4 option years months</p>

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of NIH, leads a broad scientific effort to understand the nature of aging and to extend the healthy, active years of life. The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) provides a stimulating setting for a comprehensive effort to understand aging through multidisciplinary investigator-initiated research, in this regard.</p>
<p>One of the IRP's program activities includes the Clinical Research Core (CRC) part of the NIA Clinical Unit within the Office of the Scientific Director. The CRC seeks to elucidate normative values and separate normal aging findings from disease states. The CRC's goal is to prolong disease-free states with age. The CRC serves as an infrastructure to facilitate the creation and development of therapeutic targets for the treatment of age-related disease across the Intramural Research Program. The CRC performs research in various protocol studies that have direct clinical applications to aging and disease states. Participants in the various protocols may spend one or more days in the Clinical Unit and are provided with meals.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this acquisition is to procure patient meals for those participants who require them (three meals per day, seven days per week).</p>
<p>Features/Requirements: <br />&bull; NIA research participants will be provided with fresh, temperature-appropriate meals (three meals per day, seven days per week).<br />&bull; Meals will be provided to participants either in on-site cafeteria or coffee shop, in which participants may get meals themselves, or contractor shall provide patient meals for those participants who require them and deliver them to the NIA Clinical Unit located at 3001 S. Hanover Street, Fifth Floor, Harbor Hospital, Baltimore, MD 21225. <br />&bull; For meals provided in on-site cafeteria or coffee shop, meal vouchers valued up to $15.00 per meal will be provided. <br />&bull; All meals will be prepared in the incumbent's production kitchen. <br />&bull; For meals transported to the NIA Clinical Unit, NIA's research staff will take possession of the trays and place the meal trays in the NIA designated refrigerator.<br />&bull; All transported items will be transported in appropriate containers. While meals are in its sole possession, the incumbent will implement temperature controls to meet regulatory compliance. <br />&bull; The incumbent will be responsible for removing trays and equipment from the NIA Clinical Unit and cleaning all transported items after meals have been consumed.<br />&bull; Floor stocks, nourishments and commercial nutritional supplements may be required. <br />&bull; Dietetic and related nutrition consulting services may be required to assist the research staff in developing the nutritional component of their research protocols.<br />&bull; Meals for special functions or catering may be required.</p>

<DESC>NOAA is currently performing market research on instruments in support of the Space Weather Forward Observatory (SWFO) Program. The Program will ensure the continuity of solar wind data and coronal mass ejection (CME) imagery, the National Weather Service's highest priority for space weather observations. <br /><br />New sources for solar wind data are required to replace the DSCOVR satellite, whose mission design life ends in 2020 and the extended mission life is projected to be 2024. DSCOVR is stationed at L1 as is planned for the SWFO platforms. NOAA's long-term plans are to provide continuity of measurements with the SWFO Program in the 2024 timeframe.
<p>Solar wind data are the sole input for short-term warnings (15-60 minutes) of geomagnetic storms and are input to the NOAA operational Geospace regional models of storm activity. These warnings are critical for the protection of earthbound infrastructures. This RFI is investigating unique and high heritage instruments capable of providing in-situ measurements of the bulk solar wind plasma characteristics at L1 for NOAA's upcoming mission.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in February.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for February is February 1, 2018 to February 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG03 and must be located within Region 3.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.<br /> <br /> <br /></p>

<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT Notice</p>
<p>Project Overview:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, is seeking to identify potential contractors that have the capability to provide construction services to complete necessary maintenance at the Pointe Mouillee Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) in Berlin Township, Michigan. <br /><br />The first project involves removing four, 72-inch corrugated metal pipes and replacing them with 78-inch reinforced-concrete pipe. The four pipes are located along the South Causeway, which is part of Roberts Road (see figure below), and serve as hydraulic connection between the State Game area and Lake Erie. Installation of the pipes will require some excavation, a temporary cofferdam, and dewatering around the work area. Finally, the contractor will need to ensure that four, concrete weir structures remain in place during the pipe replacement and that the new concrete pipes are re-connected (via jet grouting). <br /><br />The second project consists of constructing an access bridge, composed of rock and compacted clay, at the southeast corner of Cell 1 (see figure). This access bridge would be approximately 30 feet in length and would provide access to the weir. <br /><br />Muskrats often burrow within the sides of the CDF's dike walls which creates instability issues with the structure. Installing between 100 to 200 linear feet of stainless steel rodent mesh would be the third project that the contractor would be required to complete. This mesh would be 12 feet wide and would need to be placed on the exterior side of the dike along the northeast corner of Cell 4, near the Cross Dike (see figure below). <br /><br />Finally, the contractor will be required to provide brush cutting and mowing of any vegetation located within 30 feet of the dike's perimeter. This would include vegetation such as small trees, shrubs and phragmites. <br /><br />All equipment needed to complete the project would be the responsibility of the contractor. <br /><br />The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, which has a small business size standard of $36,500,000.00.</p>
<p>The project will likely be solicited using an Invitation for Bids (IFB) as described in FAR Part 14 - Sealed Biding, and may result in the award of a construction contract.</p>
<p>This is NOT a request for proposals (RFP). This announcement is for planning purposes only. In order to determine the extent of industry interest and experience in the requirement, interested contractors shall present the following information:</p>
<p>1. A statement of your firm's interest in the project, including the firm's name, DUNS number, address, and contact information.</p>
<p>2. Any socio-economic classification(s) (e.g., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, etc.) as they relate to NAICS code 237990.</p>
<p>3. A statement identifying ability to complete this requirement as stated.</p>
<p>4. Briefly describe how the four corrugated metal pipes would be removed and replaced with reinforced-concrete pipe.</p>
<p>5. Type(s) of equipment that would be used.</p>
<p>All qualified companies are encouraged to respond. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought or Government use of any information provided. The Government will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments.</p>
<p>Estimated Award date and Contract Timeline:</p>
<p>This project is expected to be solicited in early spring 2018. <br />Physical work is planned to begin early fall 2018. <br />The estimated cost of construction is between $1,000,000 - $5,000,000.<br />The contract will have a Period of Performance of September 2018 to December 2018.</p>
<p>Sources Sought Response Format and Required Information:</p>
<p>Contractors interested in responding are invited to submit their information via email only to Detroit District Contracting at LRE-Quotes@usace.army.mil.</p>

It provides a way to inform, educate and make people aware of what is going on in the medical center, what events are coming up, and a way to promote awareness of specific health-related topics/requirements.  Electronic communication decreases the number of posters put up on walls in the medical center, supplements the employee and patient newsletters because of its timeliness, and focuses attention on key issues such as Veterans programs, safety, quality and teamwork.

<DESC>Special Notice
<p>Description: The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Huachuca Division will be hosting an Industry Day on February 27 Feb 2018 - 1 Mar 2018 at Ft. Huachuca, AZ. Areas of focus are: information technology; test and evaluation; military intelligence; cyber security; communications, security, and logistics; engineering and systems integration; and base operations services support. There will be participation by senior leaders representing Huachuca Division's customers: U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) and its major subordinate units, U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICOE), U.S. Army Electronic Proving Ground - Ft. Huachuca (EPG), U.S. Army Information Systems Command (USAISEC), U.S. Army Communications, Security, Logistics Activity (CSLA), and Ft. Huachuca Garrison. The intent is to provide industry with information on program mission drivers; definition of program success, as viewed by the customer and/or the end user; challenges to achieving goals; problems industry can help solve; and higher level technical requirements for current and future operations to allow industry the ability to develop innovative solutions to meet the Government's needs. The Division Chief for ACC-APG, Huachuca Division, will also be providing information on its structure, various acquisition topics, strategy development, near term and long range opportunities, trends in acquisition, updates to regulatory policies and procedures, and will host a contracting activity meet and greet on the last day of the event. Finally, representatives from the City of Sierra Vista (Chamber of Commerce and Economic Development), local educational institutions of higher learning [Cochise Community College (Small Business Development Center, Procurement Technical Assistance Center), University of Arizona South (Continuing Education)] will be providing information on their programs.</p>
<p>Government Briefings: Briefings may be provided in advance if possible in order to prompt questions which will be answered during the event. There will be no classified briefings so visitor access requests are not required. The ground rules for the event consist of submitting questions via electronic means prior to the event or on note cards provided during the event. Company information will be stripped from the questions. Those questions will be presented to the customers (in advance if provided by industry via electronic means prior to the event) and oral responses provided. The Government will not provide any printed materials e.g. agendas, programs, etc. and will not distribute any notes or minutes of the event, however, a list of attendees/registrants and final Government briefings will be posted electronically to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website after the event.</p>
<p>Additional Information: The Government will not hear formal bids from industry, hold one-on-one or group meetings, or hear capabilities briefings from industry at this time as the purpose of the event is ONLY for the Government to provide information. Industry will also not be permitted to set up marketing material or have booth space at this event. There will be no sponsored breakfasts, lunches, or dinners. This is not a pre-solicitation, pre-bid, or pre-proposal conference; this event is for informational purposes only and will not be designed to provide formal briefings on any specific acquisition requirement. There will be no fee to attend, however, Industry participants will be required to preregister.</p>
<p>Pre-registration: Pre-registration is open now through 4:30 p.m. Arizona time, 09 February 2018 or until seating capacity is reached, whichever date comes first. Since space is limited, only three personnel per corporation may participate i.e. if your business is large with many companies, sectors, divisions, laboratories, etc., only three personnel per corporation (not company, sector, division, and laboratory) may attend. Please provide a completed copy of the attached registration form to: deborah.l.doyle4.civ@mail.mil and ericka.d.razo.civ@mail.mil. The subject line for the e-mail should read "ACC-APG Huachuca Division Industry Day Pre-Registration Request". Your pre-registration will be confirmed via e-mail within 3 business days of receipt.

<p>Access to Ft. Huachuca, AZ: Background checks for all individuals 18 years or older without an approved form of DoD identification are required. Visitors seeking short term access (less than 30 days) DO NOT require a Government sponsor, however, all applicants will still undergo a background check. Updated information for Fort Huachuca's installation access guidance will be posted to FBO in the near future.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: Any information provided in response to this notice is not binding upon the Government. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any information provided. Further, the Government is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals for any of the technical requirements discussed during the event. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice (or marketing efforts) and traveling to Industry Day will be solely at the interested parties' expense.

<DESC><p>Special Notice: Request for White Papers:<br />Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE)<br />Cyber Innovation Challenge #2</p>
<p><br />1.0 Purpose:</p>
<p>This Request for White Papers (RWP) is issued to seek vendors capable of fulfilling the technology objective outlined below related to enabling user access to the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) and training resources through an order portal, as well as the establishment and operation of a content repository.</p>
<p>2.0 Summary:</p>
<p>PCTE is intended to solve Department of Defense (DoD) gaps that include the capability to effectively plan, build and conduct Cyber Mission Force (CMF) training. Currently, CMF training scenarios are manually deployed on a variety of cyber range resources with varying capabilities that lack fidelity, interoperability, reusability and cannot scale to support projected CMF demands. To close this training shortfall, DoD requires a persistent cyberspace training environment that can rapidly deploy and redeploy high fidelity training scenarios, on demand, into specific environments to meet the needs of the CMF. PCTE will enable the CMF to conduct training, exercises and mission rehearsals for the full spectrum of Cyberspace Operations.</p>
<p>PCTE deploys prototype capabilities through competitive Cyber Innovation Challenges (CICs) to the field consisting of capabilities including event management, environment creation/replication, and connections into to the Services' Crew Training Facilities. With continued evaluation of the CIC prototypes by Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) personnel, the PCTE platform will continue to evolve based on changes to technology, threat, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).</p>
<p>Cyber Innovation Challenge 2 is being issued to investigate prototype solutions specifically in the area of an order portal and content repository. The intent of the challenge is to evaluate the technical feasibility of integrating these capabilities into a PCTE baseline training solution.</p>
<p>The full RWP can be viewed on the TReX website, located at the following link: https://trainingaccelerator.org/2018/01/pcte-cic-2-rwp/</p>

<p>NET AMT</p>
<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>In accordance with DoD 6025.18-R "Department of Defense Health Information Privacy Regulation," January 24, 2003, the Contractor meets the definition of Business Associate. Therefore, a Business Associate Agreement is required to comply with both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy and Security regulations.

<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)</p>
<p>Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>
<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com. <br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care. <br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

<CONTACT>Curley Hall, Contract Specialist, Phone 505-845-5949, Email curley.hall@nnsa.doe.gov
<DESC><br />The U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA), Defense Programs Office of Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation is soliciting applications for the Stewardship Science Academic Alliances (SSAA) Program. Since 1992, the United States has observed the moratorium on underground nuclear testing while significantly decreasing the size of its nuclear arsenal. National Policy required NNSA and its weapons laboratories to institute the science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) to ensure the safety, security, and effectiveness of the stockpile, while allowing the country to pursue a variety of nonproliferation and disarmament goals. The SSP combines sophisticated experiments, highly accurate physics modeling, and improved computational power to simulate and predict nuclear weapon performance over a wide range of conditions and scenarios. The SSAA Program was established in 2002 to support state-of-the-art research at U.S. academic institutions in areas of fundamental physical science and technology of relevance to the SSP mission. The SSAA Program provides the research experience necessary to maintain a cadre of trained scientists at U.S. universities to meet the nation's current and future SSP needs, with a focus on those areas not supported by other federal agencies. It supports the DOE/NNSA's priorities both to address the workforce specific needs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and to support the next generation of professionals who will meet those needs. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is announcing DOE/NNSA's interest in receiving applications for new or renewal financial assistance awards for research grants in the Stewardship Science Academic Alliances (SSAA) Program. The research areas of interest in the SSAA Program for this announcement are: properties of materials under extreme conditions and/or hydrodynamics (condensed matter physics and materials science, and fluid dynamics); low energy nuclear science; and radiochemistry.

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA258-18-AP-0628.

Contracting Activity:  The agency responsible for this acquisition is: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 22, Loma Linda Healthcare System (VALLHS). The Contracting Officer for this procurement is Monica Griffin. VALLHS proposes  to enter into a emergency purchase order on the basis of other than full and open competition for remediation and clean-up services. Purchase Request Number is: 605-18-2-6012-0035.

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Due to the weather conditions, there was a flood at the VALLHS Main Hospital first (1st) and second (2nd) floor. This is an emergency purchase order contemplated to H & M Contractors Inc., 25685 Beth Dr., Menifee, CA 92584.

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs The procurement was to provide remediation, and water clean-up services. There was a forty thousand (40,000) square feet flood at VALLHS  s main hospital on the first (1st) and second (2nd) floor.  The main drain line for the area was blocked. VALLHS brought in both an auger and jet truck to clear the blockage, and both operations were unsuccessful, therefore a skilled contractor was needed to provide remediation and water clean-up services. The flooded area impacted the patient support areas and mental health department. This purchase order is vital to VALLHS and if not awarded would jeopardize patient care. The period of performance was January 9, 2018-January 15, 2018. The cost of this emergency purchase order was $388,616.60. 

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC Â§3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  

(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 ( X )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;


Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
These services were needed immediately because the flood impacted VALLHS s operations and mission performance.  Additionally, this service was needed immediately to provide remediation and clean-up in order to prevent diseases and other health concerns to patients, staff and visitors.

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Due to the unusual and compelling urgency no other offers were solicited as this service was needed immediately. Due to patient care (mental health department and other patient support areas) being impacted, service was rendered and approved by the Deputy of Contracting.

Determination by the CO that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated total dollar amount of this procurement is $388,616.60. The Contracting Officer has relied on prior contracts to determine the pricing as fair and reasonable- as patient health was impacted.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  FAR Part 10 directs that market research be conducted on each acquisition appropriate to the circumstances.  Due to this being an emergency, market research was not conducted as patient healthcare care is in jeopardy.

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  No other sources have expressed written interest.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: See Section 6 above.

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  None. Overcoming barriers of competition is not feasible at this time, as no one is aware when a flood will impact the healthcare facility. In the future, remediation/clean-up services contract shall be solicited in order to overcome barriers, but due to this being an emergency, competition cannot be realized at this time.

Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Chiller 4: Model   YKKPK4H9-CXG / Serial Number: SMWM782220
Chiller 2 requires plugging of eight (8) tubes that are defective on the condenser side
Chiller 3 will require re-tubing of 48 defective tubes on the condenser side. 
All three (3) Chillers will require epoxy coating to prevent corrosion.  
All three (3 Chillers require disassembly of water piping and end bells.
Start-up chillers and verify operations are within specifications and standards.
This procurement is being conducted using commercial item procedures pursuant to FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13, specifically FAR Subpart13.106-1(b)(1)(i) allowing the Contracting Officer (CO) to solicit from one source.

<div style="text-align: left;">The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with JH Acquisition LLC, 1325 W 121st Avenue, Westminster, CO, 80234, using the procedures in FAR Part 13, to provide twenty six (26) Cryogenic Frostpoint Hygrometer reference sensors.  The National Weather Service (NWS) conducts upper atmosphere observations with radiosondes at one hundred two (102) sites throughout the United States, Pacific Islands, and Caribbean Islands.  These observations are used for global scale numerical weather prediction, severe weather prediction, satellite validation, and climatological measurements.  One critical piece of information from the observations is humidity measurements. The Sterling Field Support Center (SFSC) is responsible for the evaluation of all the measurements taken by a radiosonde.  The SFSC's mission includes ensuring the humidity data taken from observational platforms confirms to national and international standards with documented uncertainty in the measurement.</div>
<p>The Cryogenic Frostpoint Hygrometer was utilized in the evaluation and twenty (20) additional instruments are required for the remaining radiosonde evaluations.  Using a humidity reference instrument that is incompatible with the current configuration would be require additional time, money and resources for a new ground station, new reference instruments, and training on the data acquisition platforms.  In order to maintain the system in meeting the National Weather Service's mission to protect life and property by providing essential environmental observations used by the NWS warning systems, environmental models, short term forecasts, climate record and feed several NWS product within the NOAA NWS, it is necessary to procure the equipment. Additionally, evaluations of the measurements are intrinsic to the NWS' Weather-Ready Nation initiative by providing public and private sector users with real time observations needed to make fast and smart decisions needed to save lives and enhance commerce.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), Only one responsible source.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334519 with a business size standard of 500. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by 11:00am, February 1, 2018. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) upon the basis of the authority provided at FAR 13.106(b).
<p><br />The ERDC-CRREL Signature Physics Branch has a requirement for measurements of unfrozen water content in frozen soil samples as a function of temperature, using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) instrumentation.</p>
<p>University of Alaska Fairbanks has the technical expertise, experience, and in-house system for performing NMR measurements on frozen soils. Professor Margaret Darrow of the Dept. of Mining and Geological Engineering at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, has developed a unique system for performing NMR measurements on frozen soils, as described in her group's recent paper by Kruse et al, "Improvements in Measuring Unfrozen Water in Frozen Soils Using the Pulsed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Method," Journal of Cold Regions Engineering, 2018, 32(1): 04017016. The NMR method commonly used to determine unfrozen water content in frozen soils is calculated by using the first return data from the free induction decay (FID) signal intensity (SI); however, these data often contain both ice and liquid water responses, thus overestimating unfrozen water. UAF's approach is to use a normalization method for calculating unfrozen water by refining the NMR testing system for greater temperature control which improves accuracy by up to 3.3 times greater. The custom NMR system is uniquely capable of providing the results critical to accomplishing the scope of work required for CRREL's on-going research project.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541380, which has a size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.

<DESC>PLA SYNOPSIS:<br />The Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements, (PLAs), for a large scale construction contract, (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:
<p>Project Description: Border Barrier System RGV-01</p>
<p>Project Location: Alamo, Texas</p>
<p>Summary: Construction services required include DBB construction of approximately 3 miles of levee wall on the south toe of the U.S. International Boundary Water Commission (IBWC) levee in the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector.  This project will also include installation of fiber optic cable, lighting systems, and construction of an all-weather patrol road and enforcement zone.</p>
<p>DFAR 236.204 Disclosure of the magnitude of construction projects. Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. Period of Performance: 300 calendar days after notice to proceed, estimated.</p>
<p>PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy Subpart 22.503:</p>
<p>a.) Project Labor Agreement, (PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b.) An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p>1.) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...</p>
<p>2.) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br />a.) The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br />b.) The complexity of the project.<br />c.) Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d.) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br />e.) The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br />f.) The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g.) The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. h.) Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>Please reference FAR Provision: 52.222-33 "Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement" and FAR Clause: 52.222-34 Alternate I (May 2010) "Project Labor Agreements."</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a.) Should PLA's be executed on this selected large dollar contract in Alamo, Texas? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?</p>
<p>b.) Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c.) Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d.) Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e.) Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f.) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g.) Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h.) Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the Alamo, Texas area?</p>
<p>i.) Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential Offerors and/or subcontractors to meet their Small Business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Note: For yes or no answers, please provide a supporting narrative.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via email ONLY to: craig.d.harper@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 5 February 2018 Central Time 10:00 AM.</p>

<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades; do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements?</p>
<p>g. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?

<DESC>The Savannah District intends to award a modification extending the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) contract for J. Strom Thurmond Project. The contract was awarded with a twelve month base period with four one-year options ending 23 April 2018. The current contract was competitively solicited and awarded as a small business set-aside. The planned modification will extend the contract for not more than six (6) months, ending 23 October 2018. The estimated value of the proposed modification will be $2,500,000.00.
<p>Services will be maintained at a minimum level of effort to maintain current conditions at the J. Strom Thurmond, New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam, and Richard B. Russell Projects and respond to emergencies and unanticipated requirements. These services will also constitute the minimum services necessary to maintain the safety of the visiting public and the integrity of Projects' facilities and resources. Depending on the needs of the Projects, work to be completed under this six-month extension may include services such as janitorial, facility maintenance, landscape maintenance, storm damage response, vehicle and equipment maintenance, sign and road maintenance, maintenance and repair of retaining walls, forestry, fish and wildlife management, shoreline stabilization, maintaining aids to navigation, courtesy dock maintenance and emergency spill response. This extension not only provides for normal operation and maintenance requirements but also for unscheduled maintenance requirements that may arise during the extension period on all structures, electrical and water systems. It will also provide for well and water quality testing, erosion control needs, aquatic plant control, and elevator and security system maintenance. Items of unscheduled work often occur simultaneously due to heavy visitor attendance, special events, inclement weather or storm damage. These requirements are geographically spread out over 12 counties in Georgia and South Carolina. Thurmond Project is one of the largest and most diverse USACE multi-purpose projects nationwide, with over five million visitors annually. It includes 80,000 acres of land and 70,000 acres of water, with over 1,000 miles of shoreline and 520 miles of boundary line. It operates eight campgrounds, six major day use areas, 28 boat ramps and the Thurmond Dam and Power Plant. Russell Project is a medium sized multi-purpose project, with approximately 1,000,000 visitors a year. It includes approximately 26,458 acres of land, 26,653 acres of water and 540 miles of shoreline in four counties and two states, Georgia and South Carolina. The Russell Dam and Power Plant is located on the Savannah River 37.4 miles above J Strom Thurmond Dam and the lake runs for 29.9 miles below Hartwell Dam. It operates the Power Plant, Project Management Office/Visitor Center, and 2 Recreation areas. The New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam (NSBLD), completed in 1937, is located 187 miles upstream of the mouth of the Savannah River and approximately 13 miles downstream from Augusta, Georgia. The project was authorized for commercial navigation; however, due to a lack of commercial use, the project has been in a caretaker status since 1979. The structure currently provides a stable pool for water supply intakes for twelve large industries and municipalities and recreation to downtown Augusta and areas near the Lock &amp; Dam.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award the modification consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy the requirement. In order for the Government to meet upcoming requirements in a timely manner, this action is necessary. This will result in the Government being able to meet its immediate needs without delays and compromising its mission. The Government will support the proposed actions by written justification and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding. The Government will post the approved justification. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement; however, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All capability statements received prior to the response date and time will be reviewed by the Government and considered. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Should your firm desire to submit a capability statement, it should demonstrate the Offeror's experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length. Written inquiries may be directed to Teresa Kelly via email at teresa.l.kelly@usace.army.mil.</p>

The COR at each location will be authorized to place or modify pick-up orders for their particular location. Additional roles and responsibilities will be clearly defined in the COR designation letter. 

11. SECURITY

The Security classification for this is low due to the transfer of hard drives that are encrypted with Systematic Endpoint Encryption (SEE). The VA-Wide Risk Based Decision (RBD) #9 allows hard drives encrypted with FIPS 140-2 standard to be shipped with facility required pre-sanitization. Information is deemed low.
 


12. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
The Contractor is, or will use, a legitimate recycling operation to perform the services under this SOW. The Contractor, and/or recycling facility shall have all necessary permits and/or licenses for processing and transporting the type of waste material specified in this SOW.
