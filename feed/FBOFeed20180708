<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 541360 with a Small Business Size Standard $15.0M for an upcoming requirement for airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey for Midway-Sunset Regions, Southern San Joaquin Valley, CA to provide digitally recorded and processed airborne geophysical and ancillary data. 

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary. 

Project Description: The USGS has a request to conduct an airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey covering San Joaquin Valley, CA.

The USGS requests airborne geophysical data covering areas in the southern San Joaquin Valley, California using magnetic and electromagnetic methods.  An electromagnetic system is required that can image lithologic variations, groundwater salinity variations, and structural controls on groundwater flow within agricultural and suburban areas.  These data are intended for rigorous inversion and interpretation of the 3-D hydrogeologic conditions of the subsurface. These data will be used in aquifer and salinity mapping, the design of groundwater monitoring strategies, and the characterization of geologic structures.

The goal is to provide high quality airborne geophysical data that will be used for quantitative hydrogeologic framework and groundwater salinity studies.

The Contractor shall furnish all travel, mobilization, labor, materials, aircraft and aircraft facilities, and demobilization, except as otherwise specified herein, required for conducting a magnetic survey. The contractor shall provide digitally recorded and processed airborne data in accordance with the terms, conditions and specifications set forth in this contract.

The government has a definite requirement for and plans to award a minimum of 1,000 line kilometers (km) with an up to 1,500 optional “add-on” line km pending availability of funds.    

A scope of work will be provided with any solicitation that may be issued.

In response to this announcement, please indicate your firm's socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service-disabled veteran-owned, women owned, HUBZone, etc.)  This information will assist the Government in determining how small businesses can fit into the acquisition strategy.



A firm is considered small under NAICS code 541360 if their AVERAGE annual receipts for the preceding three (3) years were less than or equal to $15.0 million. Any information submitted is voluntary. If sufficient interest and capability is not received from firms in categories (1) through (4) above, any solicitation may be issued as unrestricted without further consideration.

Interested small business firms shall submit (1) NAME, ADDRESS, and PHONE NUMBER OF THE FIRM (including DUNS NUMBER); (2) a CAPABILITY STATEMENT including (a) RECENT (within the last three fiscal years) RELEVANT (similar projects to this requirement) performance history (identify the name of the owner and their point(s) of contact with telephone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses; and (b) in what capacity (e.g., prime, subcontractor etc.) they performed the work; and (3) their SIZE STATUS. 

Your company must have a DUNs number and be registered on-line at the System for Award Management (SAM). You will also be required to provide your small business status information either via the RFP or the On-line Representations and Certifications (ORCA) also located at the SAM website before an award to your company can be made.

All responses must be submitted NLT July 16, 2018 at 3:00pm MST via e-mail to: rvaldez@usgs.gov.

This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.
