<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory has a requirement to develop a new MFIRE 3.0 based on the old MFIRE 2.20. The MFIRE 3.0 back-end engine will be written in object-oriented, ANSI-compliant C++. It will be structured as a class library that can be re-used to build new simulation programs that need to model mine ventilation and fires. It will have discrete event simulation capabilities that allow mine ventilation and fires to be tracked over time. However, no improvements are requested regarding the underlying ventilation model.
<p>The CDC intends to award a single fixed price contract.</p>
<p>The Statement of Work has a four phase approach including the final report (IV), each of which adds additional capabilities to the model. NIOSH reserves the option to fund any phase combination subject to the availability of funds. Therefore, potential vendors are asked to provide separate time and cost estimates for performing each phase.</p>
<p>A very simple front-end user interface will also be developed that uses the MFIRE 3.0 class library. This front-end will allow validation of the MFIRE library and permit NIOSH to continue to run MFIRE as a standalone program. However, it is expected that third party developers will utilize the MFIRE library to develop more sophisticated front-ends (such as adding graphical capabilities to view and edit the mine network and progression of simulated fires). For this reason, the front-end developed under this contract should be designed to meet only basic needs for testing and running MFIRE simulations. Further, the class library must be designed as public domain software, and must not require third party developers to purchase additional software or software licenses to utilize it.</p>
<p>The RFP will be issued on an unrestricted basis to full and open competition and will be<br />issued on or about April 3, 2009, with a 30 day closing. The complete solicitation document, and reference material if applicable will be available electronically at HTTP://FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number 2009-N-11122. Paper copies WILL NOT be available and No telephone requests will be accepted. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site for any updates/amendments. No government-wide notes apply.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS), Section 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.  The FAA intends to enter into a single source contract with Computer Science Corporation (CSC), of Rockville, Maryland.
The FAA has a need to establish a contract vehicle to provide for the continuation of the existing Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) system until a new competitive contract can be awarded.  This procurement action is a follow-on effort to existing TMA contract DTFA03-02-D-00001 with CSC, with a period of performance of 12/12/2003 thru 04/24/2009.  
The TMA system currently resides in Enroute & Oceanic Program Operations ( ATO-E ) and will be transitioned to System Operations Programs (ATO-R) in April 2009.  At that time the existing contract for development and sustainment work will expire.  A new contract will be needed to ensure uninterrupted development and sustainment of operational TMA by progressing and completing the work started by ATO-E under the existing program of record.  This would include enhancements that were agreed to and/or started on under the ATO-E as well as support for the current TMA deployment sites.  
Due to the fact that CSC is the prime contractor, they are the only vendor that has the existing knowledge, both hardware and software, of the TMA system.  CSC has been working on the TMA system since the 1990s, working with Northrop Grumman and finally as the sole vendor from 2003 to today.  
This single source interim contract will begin April 2009 and the period of performance is anticipated to be no longer than one year or until the full and open Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) contract is awarded, whichever comes first.  
Total estimated dollar value is $15,000,000, structured as a 6 month base period, and three 2-month option periods.Inquiries regarding this announcement may be directed to John Gamble, Contracting Officer until 4 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, March 25, 2009, at the following email address:  john.gamble@faa.gov.

A size standard is the largest that a concern can be and still qualify as a small business for Federal Government programs. For the most part, size standards are the average annual receipts or the average employment of a firm. How to calculate average annual receipts and average employment of a firm can be found in 13 CFR § 121.104 and 13 CFR § 121.106, respectively. SBA also includes the table of size standards in the Small Business Size Regulations, 13 CFR 121.201. This table includes size standards that have changed since the last publication of 13 CFR 121.

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition intends to solicit on a sole source basis with the Oregon Health and Sciences University, One Sky Center, Portland, Oregon, for further development and refinement of the mentoring program and other activities to increase the involvement of underrepresented and other scholars interested in substance abuse and addiction research in American Indian/Alaskan Native populations. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are severely underrepresented in both the social and basic sciences. To begin to address this issue the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) established the Special Populations Office (SPO) to encourage and support persons from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in substance abuse and addiction research. NIDA convened the American Indian/Alaska Native Researchers and Scholars Workgroup (AIANRSG) to provide recommendations on research needed to better understand, prevent and treat substance abuse and addiction in AI/AN populations and to develop addiction research capacity development in AI/AN communities.</p>
<p>Underrepresented minority researchers face a number of challenges that influence their success in obtaining sponsored support from NIDA/NIH and other federal funding agencies. Some of these challenges include limited/poor mentoring, lack of knowledge of funding opportunities and requirements, and limited resources. Additional barriers for AI/AN populations include the low number of AI/AN students in the research pipeline, the scarcity of AI/AN research scientists who can serve as mentors, and skepticism held by the community towards research and government sponsored programs. Collectively, these factors impact NIDA's efforts to increase and retain AI/AN investigators conducting substance abuse and addiction research and further develop the research infrastructure within Indian country.</p>
<p>Scientific mentoring is a valuable method that serves to promote interest in research as well as retain scientists already in the research pipeline. The AIANRSG began the development of the Native to Native Mentoring Program to provide mentorship and research exposure to early/new scientists interested in pursuing careers in substance abuse and addiction research. In 2008, the AIANRSG was able to meet to discuss plans for the mentoring program and begin to recruit mentors and mentees. Initial plans were discussed at two AI/AN health and research based meetings -- the "Association of American Indian Physicians Meeting" in Idaho and the "Native Health Research Conference" in Oregon. In addition, some mentors and mentees attended two NIDA meetings -- the "NIDA Researchers and Scholars Joint Workgroup Meeting" and the "Research Development Seminar Series".</p>
<p>Oregon Health and Sciences Center currently participates in the Native to Native Mentoring Program. In addition, Oregon Health and Sciences Center provides regular meetings to the AI/AN community, especially in the substance abuse and addiction research. <br />The contract will be used to provide the following deliverables:</p>
<p>&bull; Host periodic planning conference calls between AIANRSG members, NIDA staff, and/or mentees</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct a structured and managed mentoring program to train and support the career development of underrepresented scholars/investigators and others interested in pursuing research careers in substance abuse and addiction in the AI/AN population.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop short and long-term mentoring plans for each participant identifying needs and activities to address the needs.</p>
<p>&bull; Support the attendance at annual Researchers and Scholars Joint Workgroup meetings held in the Washington, DC area.</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in at least three scientific meetings convened by groups with a mission and interest similar to the goals of the mentoring program for the purpose of recruiting students/faculty, encouraging interest in addiction research, educating attendees about drug abuse and addiction in AI/AN communities, e.g., the Association of American Indian Physicians, Indian Health Service, the Office for Minority Health, and American Indian Research Network.</p>
<p><br />The final product will consist of: <br />&bull; A report describing the program including course/curriculum outline, activities, collaborations, products (if any), outcomes, lessons learned, major barriers, major achievements, and recommendations. <br />&bull; Evaluation assessments or reports from program participants regarding their activities, expectations, benefits, and continuing needs. <br />&bull; Evaluation assessments or reports from mentors describing mentee performance from AI/AN project directors in whose projects the mentees were embedded.</p>
<p><br />The period of performance will be 12 months. NIDA will have the opportunity to extend this contract, up to two additional option years.</p>
<p><br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>

Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the Denver Service Center will continue to acquire such specialized services.  The DSC does not intend to allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on subconsultant's services.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound has a requirement for ONE (1) each Hurco VMX 42 Vertical Machining Center with 4th axis.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  FISCPS intends to purchase the item on a sole source basis from Hurco, the manufacturer, through their Washington State distributor, Rosco Precision Machinery.  Rosco Precision Machinery is the only distributor identified by Hurco to sell this equipment in this geographic location.  The Hurco VMX 42 with 4th axis is equipped with dual screen WinMax (tm) software.  Market research has determined that Hurco's VMX 42 is the only vertical machining center that will fit within the space configuration for the existing footprint location without electrical or structural changes.  This is a direct replacement for an existing first generation Hurco model VMX 42.  Shop personnel have ! been trained on and are familiar with the software programs involved.  Spare parts, and existing Hurco VMX 42 specific tooling will be usable with upgraded model.  This requirement is solicited using commercial, simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.5.  Interested sources may submit their capabilities and qualifications to meet the requirement in writing to the identified contract specialist not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on 3/30/2009.  All information should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Dianne Palmatier, Code 250, fax: 360-476-8701, or email: dianne.palmatier@navy.mil.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All ! responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is seeking innovative solutions for high-bandwidth free-space laser communications (lasercomm) for tactical level digital communications for the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and the United States Navy (USN).  Offerors will be asked to develop systems to provide tactical level digital lasercomm systems for integration with USN and USMC networks.  Proposed solutions will enable high-bandwidth, jam-resistant communications with a low probability of intercept and detection (LPI/LPD) between tactical edge platforms and users over non-Radio Frequency (RF) communication paths in order to improve the robustness, security, and timely transmission of USN and USMC communications.  All solutions offered should minimize reliance on any RF based communication systems to allow communications during Electronic Emission Control (EMCON), Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) or other conditions where RF communication systems are unavailable.

The focus of this program is on the development of lasercomm systems capable of connecting to a USN/USMC network and autonomously linking to another USN/USMC network via a lasercomm communication link.  Terminals should communicate both in a “direct mode” between two lasercomm terminals and in a Modulating Retro-reflector (MRR) mode where one end of the link is a lasercomm terminal and the other end of the link is an MRR terminal.

<p>Project Description: Installation of the backflow preventers will bring Smithsonian buildings at the Suitland Collections Center (SCC) into full compliance with the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) code requirements. Backflow of contaminants at the cross-connections is to be prevented by adding reduced pressure zone (RPZ) backflow preventers at each potable water service entrance and a double check valve assembly (DCVA) backflow preventer at each fire service entrance. Due to the resulting pressure reduction after backflow valve installation, increased capacity of domestic water pumps and fire pumps will be added as necessary to complete the installation.</p>

<p>The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $33,500,000.00.</p>
<p>The estimated price range of this requirement is between $2,050,000.00 and $3,400,000.00.</p>
<p>It is the Smithsonian's intent to award a Delivery Order under an existing IDIQ Contract. The Delivery Order will be awarded under the authority of FAR 16.505.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a 12 month cost reimbursement contract with four (4) 12 month option periods entitled Knowledge Application Program (KAP).   The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment’s (CSAT) grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts are designed to develop knowledge on best practices in substance abuse treatment.  In 1999, CSAT implemented a systematic program to synthesize, publish, and disseminate this knowledge to the substance abuse (SA) treatment and related fields through the Knowledge Application Program (KAP).  KAP has been responsible for production of CSAT’s premiere publication series, Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs). The current KAP has also been charged with considering the most effective formats for presenting TIPs to each of its intended audiences, and determining whether the specialized knowledge contained in the TIPs is actually reaching and being adopted by those most in need of that knowledge.  

The current KAP contract has begun to address the need for SA treatment knowledge to be synthesized and packaged in different ways depending on the target audience.  For example, new formats known as “collateral products” have been developed to supplement the standard TIP document in order to better meet the needs of some audiences. The existing KAP program was built on the following premises: 1) Treatment information needs to be presented to target audiences through a range of media and learning approaches including interactive workshops, Internet training courses and videos, as well as the traditional training classes and written publications; and 2) To be most useful, information must be specifically tailored to the particular needs of specialized provider groups and must also be culturally relevant when appropriate.

KAP must support the strong emphasis at SAMHSA on the Science to Services and Workforce Development initiatives.  KAP will continue to address a number of diverse knowledge application activities in a cost effective and coordinated manner.  These activities will include publishing, communicating, and disseminating products to enhance quality of treatment services.  Successful implementation of the science to services cycle requires a strong monitoring and feedback component. Within the context of this requirement, offerors should demonstrate how they will promote SAMHSA's focus on disseminating effective interventions rather than generating new ones, support performance monitoring systems, assess impact of fidelity vs. adaptation on outcomes of treatment provider use of both KAP and non-KAP products, and provide input to the scientific community regarding new research priorities and service gaps for the substance abuse treatment field. Offerors shall also discuss their vision for the role of KAP in building a national dissemination network that links together existing training and technical assistance programs, and how KAP can generally support communities and providers to identify, implement, use, and evaluate best practices.  

The estimated date of issuance of the RFP is April 01, 2009 with proposals responses, by April 30, 2009.  This solicitation maybe obtained in any of four ways; by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1051, Rockville, MD 20852; FedBizOps, or electronically at the SAMHSA web site: http://samhsa.gov/contracts. Files will not be made available on either Website until on or after the estimated issuance date.  Once downloaded, you should determine if you have a continuing interest in the RFP.  If so, you must either write the individual identified below and request a copy of the amendments to the RFP (if any) be sent to you by mail, or check the Web regularly for amendments which will also be posted at FedBizOps and the SAMHSA website and can be downloaded electronically. 

NOTE: If you rely on the Web for obtaining the RFP amendments, SAMHSA has no way to assure, and therefore assume no responsibility for assuring that you have downloaded these documents. All RFP requests must include the RFP number and be in writing.  Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after the twentieth day will reach the requestor before the due date for receipt of responses.  Requests shall be forwarded to the attention of Andrew Payne, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts, OPS, Substance Abuse and Mental health Services Administration, DHHS, 1 Choke Cherry Road, room 7-1051, Rockville, Maryland 20857.  Requests may be sent via fax to (240) 276-1510, but please confirm by phone that your fax request has been received.   Electronic mail and telephone requests will not be honored.  *****

ICT  Modernization for EgyptAir Maintenance and Engineering Technical Assistance
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance for ICT Modernization for EgyptAir Maintenance and Engineering.  

EgyptAir was established in 1932 to serve the domestic and Middle East markets and in 2002, the airline was converted into EgyptAir Holding Company (EgyptAir Holding) with related subsidiaries, in a business reorganization aimed at generating the best business and customer performance. EgyptAir Maintenance and Engineering Company (EgyptAir M&E) (the "Grantee") is a wholly owned subsidiary of EgyptAir Holding Company.
The objectives of this ICT Modernization for EgyptAir Maintenance and Engineering project (Project) are to 1) provide EgyptAir M&E with a global competitive benchmarking perspective; 2) assess EgyptAir M&E's operations and business processes, focusing on creating an modernization and transformation plan for an operational and organizational transformation; and 3) recommend an updated ICT infrastructure and asset modernization and transformation plan that addresses the organization's needs.
The Contractor shall work with EgyptAir M&E to assess its internal business functions and determine ways to improve and enhance each department's operations in order to improve overall productivity, customer satisfaction, and the subsidiary's financial performance. This functional and performance improvement and competitive analysis aims to improve and enhance EgyptAir M&E performance, while focusing on redefining the business mission and vision, and developing a modernization and transformation  plan that will be implemented by EgyptAir M&E. The Contractor will analyze EgyptAir M&E's current operations and business processes to identify strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies that are jeopardizing the subsidiary's goals and define areas of potential improvement including organizational and process changes to position the business for more effective growth and sustainability. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $653,917 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and a grantee cost share of US $180,967, for a total Project budget cost of US $834,884.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by
12:00pm NOON Local Time, May 14, 2009
at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for USAID/Pakistan to solicit proposals from qualified organizations interested in implementing the Strengthening Justice with Pakistan (SJP) program.

USAID’s strategic objective for this program is to Strengthen the Judiciary to Achieve Progress in Judicial Efficiency, Transparency, Accessibility, Independence and Accountability.  The program’s five sub-objectives elaborated above are all inextricably linked.  

The SJP will fulfill its strategic objective and sub-objectives through the following five main activities:

Activity 1:  Strengthening the Judiciary – by providing support in the area of institutional strengthening.

Activity 2:  Building Capacity through Legal Training and Enhanced Professionalism - by supporting pre-service and in-service legal training.

Activity 3:  Policy and Legal Reform – by providing the basis for establishing a stakeholder dialogue on judicial reform with ongoing consultations throughout the life of the project.

Activity 4:  Grants Under Contract – by managing a small grants program.  In the short- to medium-term, small grants at the local level will enable local actors to enhance the public’s understanding and trust in the judiciary.

Activity 5:  Gender Strategy – by developing and implementing a gender strategy that will assure the integration of substantial women’s participation into all activities.

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  USAID anticipates awarding a three-year Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract with an option period for two additional years. The solicitation is expected to be issued by early April 2009 and will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website (http://www.fbo.gov).  Any amendments to this solicitation will also be issued on this website.

USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in this activity as the prime contractor or as subcontractor in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR.  USAID also encourages the use of the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the Federal Business Opportunities website page so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.

Any questions should be submitted via email to the point of contact specified in this notice.  The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Particle-Size-Distribution Measurement System combining 1) asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation, 2) multi-angle light scattering, and 3) dynamic light scattering in support of the NIST Enabling Devices Group which requires a Soft-Matter Nanoscale-Metrology System to support its work in Nanobiotechnology and Liposome Nanoparticles.  The system will comprise three commercial instruments, 1) a Hard-Matter 3D AFM, 2) a Bio-AFM, and 3) a Nanoparticle Size-Distribution Measurement Tool.  The types of samples to be measured in this system include soft and hard nano-particles, nano-lines, nano-trenches, nano-tubes, and nano-pores, as well biological surfaces and molecules.  The properties of these samples will be investigated in support of Group projects, for possible use as standard reference materials, and to compare the measurement standards and capabilities of the hard-matter and soft-matter nano-measurement communities.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a Particle-Size-Distribution Measurement System that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

DESCRIPTION:  The Directed Energy Technology Office (DETO), Code Q206, of the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Laboratory (NSWCDL) is seeking proposals for innovative technology research and development in the areas of high power source technology, advanced broadband antenna concepts, and compact power generation/conversion for Directed Energy applications. These include innovative and novel!  ideas for significant improvements in peak power, bandwidth and average power capability relative to current RF source technology.  The level of funding is expected to exceed $6M in FY09. This BAA is also targeting high power broad-band antenna concepts with modest to high directivity, along with compact power generation technology, and advanced waste-heat conversion technology for heat-rejection minimization. Novel solutions for significant improvement in current technology in robustness, efficiency, size, and weight are sought. The nine areas of interest are listed below in more detail.FOCUS AREA 1:  Low power (40-80kW) CW,  VHF & UHF technologies.  The goal in this area is to develop broad-band RF amplifiers capable of chirp/sweep across an instantaneous fractional bandwidth of 15%-20%. Proposals under this solicitation are encouraged to address: 1) novel efficiency mitigation techniques to overcome bandwidth/efficiency trade-offs, 2) high-voltage breakdown issues in ground-level military environments 3) compactness and robustness of device, and 4) low-volume build costs.  FOCUS AREA 2: Medium power (200-300kW) CW, UHF technologies.  The goal in this area is to develop broad-band RF amplifiers capable of chirp/sweep across an instantaneous fractional bandwidth of 10%-15%. Proposals under this solicitation are encouraged to address: 1) novel efficiency mitigation techniques to overcome bandwidth/efficiency trade-offs, 2) high-voltage breakdown issues in ground-level military environments 3) compactness and robustness of device, and 4) low-volume build cost! s.  Special consideration will be given to proposals which innovatively address overall size and efficiency optimizations which should include considerations for pre-driver size for example.  FOCUS AREA 3:  High power (750-1000kW) CW, UHF technologies.  The goal in this area is to develop broad-band RF amplifiers capable of sweeping/chirping across an instantaneous fractional bandwidth of 10%-15%. Proposals under this solicitation are encouraged to include: a) novel concepts for efficiency preservation under large bandwidth constraints, b) high-voltage mitigation schemes, c) volumetric and weight optimization, d) robustness, and e) overall system complexity minimization.  Awardees in this topical area must have a historical record of advanced design, simulation, and experimental elements of advanced R&D in high power vacuum electronics.  Phase 2 for this effort, assuming funding availability, will be to build and test a brass-board device designed in phase 1.  Furthermore, ! this solicitation is restricted to those entities with DoD SECRET clearances for all necessary personnel and facilities to perform work. This research initiative will involve a joint government-industrial team consisting of Navy, Air Force, and the selected industrial R&D partner(s). This research effort will necessitate a truly advanced approach to R&D system engineering in that the source, advanced cooling, power and modulator subsystems all are highly interdependent, and thus must be designed together, with trade-offs dictated by any given limiting subsystem capability.  Overall system stability is forefront for the entire design.  FOCUS AREA 4:  High peak power (20-30MW), L-Band (1-2 GHz) RF technologies. The program is specifically looking at 2 frequencies within this band.  The goal in this area is to develop RF technology capable of rep-rates greater than 150 pps, and pulse widths up to 50 microseconds.  Proposals under this solicitation are encouraged to address:1) novel dual frequency concepts in a single device, 2) instantaneous frac! tional bandwidths from 10%-15%, 3) optimization of efficiency, volume and weight, 4) overall compactness and robustness of device, and 5) low-volume build costs.  Single amplifier/oscillator device solutions for each separate frequency will also be considered.  FOCUS AREA 5:  Very high peak power (100+MW), HF/VHF/UHF pulsed wideband RF generators.  The goal in this area is to develop compact, rugged wideband RF sources capable of rep-rates greater than 50 pps with pulse widths from 10-500 ns.  The focus is on compact systems on the order of several hundred pounds and a volume less than 100 cubic ft. Proposals under this solicitation are encouraged to address:1) novel antenna concepts for directionality and gain across the wide bandwidth, 2) techniques for generating multiple frequencies instantaneously and/or by electronic tuning during the pulse, 3) instantaneous fractional bandwidths greater than 20%, 4) optimization of efficiency, volume and weight, 5) overall compactnes! s and robustness of device, 6) high-voltage breakdown issues in military environments, and 7) low-volume build costs.  This research effort will necessitate a truly advanced approach to R&D system level engineering in that the RF generator, antenna, and prime power/power modulator subsystems all are highly interdependent, and thus must be designed together, with trade-offs dictated by any given limiting capability of said subsystem, with the overall system stability in mind.  Furthermore, this topical solicitation is restricted to those entities with DoD SECRET clearances for all necessary personnel and facilities to perform work.  FOCUS AREA 6:  High Power (>1 MW) L-Band (1-2GHz) sources capable of chaotic mode oscillations.  Specific attention will be paid to proposals with goals of chaotic waveform generation covering a 200MHz band from 1.1 GHz - 1.3 GHz.  Proposals under this solicitation are encouraged to address: 1) optimization of efficiency, volume and weight, 2) overall compactness and robustness of device, and 3) low-volume build cos! ts.  FOCUS AREA 7:  Novel and innovative techniques for waste heat conversion into electrical or mechanical work.  Research areas such as thermoelectric (TEG, etc.), thermoacoustic, and the like are encouraged to reply.  Heat recuperation levels in the 10-50kW range are of great interest.  Proposals under this solicitation are furthermore encouraged to address:1) compactness and robustness, 2) complexity minimization, and 3) efficiency.  FOCUS AREA 8:  Focus Area 8 addresses the need for a compact, rugged, DC diesel generator.  The goal in this area is to develop a compact, light, rugged DC diesel generator that is capable of 400kW at 135F using JP-8 fuel.  Nominal output voltage is 700VDC +25VDC/-50VDC.  It is acceptable for the proposed solution to be a single or combination of multiple generators to produce the desired output power.  The generator will operate in a mobile environment and must be as small and light as possible.  Proposals are encouraged to address: 1) en! gine selection, 2) generator head design, 3) active rectifier design and power conditioning, 4) packaging, 5) system modeling to determine performance characteristics, 6) reliability, 7) cost (low and high volume), and 8) weight.  FOCUS AREA 9:  Focus Area 9 addresses the need for an antenna that will focus L-Band power (1.2 - 1.6 GHz) at approximately a 120-m range from the antenna to deliver a high power density area (~30 W/cm2) over a specified cross sectional area (3 meters diameter).  The input power to the antenna is assumed to be approximately 30MW peak at two different L-band frequencies that will be fed from two separate L-band sources.  The objective of this focus area is to develop design studies for an antenna that will meet the performance parameters listed in this focus area with particular emphasis on reducing the physical size of the antenna.  Manufacturability of the proposed antenna design will be a critical parameter in the proposal evaluation criteria. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION PROCESS FOR WHITE PAPERS:  All white papers s! ubmissions will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 15.207, applicable law, and Department of Defense and Department of Navy regulations.

Submissions of white papers under this BAA are expected to be unclassified.  However, confidential/classified proposals are permitted with prior/ advanced approval from the TPOC.  The NSWCDD, Code CXS13 must be notified in writing 5 working days prior to submission of any classified proposals. Every classified proposal must be accompanied by an Unclassified Statement of Work (SOW). Alternatives!  to the format and content identified below may be appropriate depending on the scope and nature of the proposed effort.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division anticipates making multiple awards of contracts.  All white papers received that indicate interest in a particular research/technology area will be reviewed for potential projects in that area.  Please identify the area in which your research and/or technology is to be considered.  IMPORTANT  Certain white papers are not appropriate under this BAA and are not desired.  Engineering and technical services white papers are not appropriate.  These usually involve applying effort toward a broadly identified task, often on a level-of-effort basis, rather than delivery of an end item such as a final report.  This BAA seeks white papers for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art, increasing knowledge/understanding, and the knowledge gained by brass-board design, build and testing.  A determination of appropriateness will be made on a cas! e-by-case basis by government scientists and engineers.  Proposal Evaluation:  White papers will be reviewed and formal technical and cost proposals may be required from sources whose approaches have been selected for further consideration. An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure subsequent contract award.  Formal Cost and Technical Proposals may be required approximately four (4) weeks after notification that NSWCDD has decided to pursue the offeror's approach as identified in their white paper submission.  The following evaluation criteria apply to all submitted white papers in all focus areas.  These submissions will be selected through a technical/scientific/cost decision process with technical and scientific considerations being more important than cost.  Even though cost is of less importance than all the technical factors combined, it will not be ignored.  The degree of its importance will increase with the degree of equality of the white papers in relatio! n to the other factors on which selection is to be based, or when the cost is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government. Criteria A-D is listed in descending order of priority.  Any sub criteria listed under a particular criterion are of equal importance to each other.  Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria: (A) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; (B) Naval relevance, transition potential and anticipated contributions of the proposed scientific research; (C) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, and past performance, including the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; (D) Realism of the proposed cost; and (E) Availability of funds.  White papers should be written in MS Word format, photos and illustration should be in either .jpg or .pdf format.  The white paper shall be emailed to angela.headley@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only seeking responses from Small Businesses.  Large and Non Profit Businesses are not to respond.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to this 541690 NAICS Code. Teaming is encouraged. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only. The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and four option years. After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time. Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the questions listed below.  In addition, please provide a capability statement addressing your organization’s ability to perform as a prime contractor the work described below.

The mission of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is to bring effective substance abuse and mental health programs to every community.  SAMHSA carries out this mission by compiling prevention, treatment and rehabilitation knowledge, identifying and promoting science-based programs, and building capacity at the State and regional levels to infuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation knowledge and programs into every community in the United States.

The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment’s (CSAT) grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts are designed to develop knowledge on best practices in substance abuse treatment.  In 1999, CSAT implemented a systematic program to synthesize, publish, and disseminate this knowledge to the substance abuse (SA) treatment and related fields through the Knowledge Application Program (KAP).  KAP has been responsible for production of CSAT’s premiere publication series, Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs). The current KAP has also been charged with considering the most effective formats for presenting TIPs to each of its intended audiences, and determining whether the specialized knowledge contained in the TIPs is actually reaching and being adopted by those most in need of that knowledge.  

The current KAP contract has begun to address the need for SA treatment knowledge to be synthesized and packaged in different ways depending on the target audience.  For example, new formats known as “collateral products” have been developed to supplement the standard TIP document in order to better meet the needs of some audiences. The existing KAP program was built on the following premises: 1) Treatment information needs to be presented to target audiences through a range of media and learning approaches including interactive workshops, Internet training courses and videos, as well as the traditional training classes and written publications; and 2) To be most useful, information must be specifically tailored to the particular needs of specialized provider groups and must also be culturally relevant when appropriate.

KAP must support the strong emphasis at SAMHSA on the Science to Services and Workforce Development initiatives.  KAP will continue to address a number of diverse knowledge application activities in a cost effective and coordinated manner.  These activities will include publishing, communicating, and disseminating products to enhance quality of treatment services.  Successful implementation of the science to services cycle requires a strong monitoring and feedback component. Within the context of this requirement, offerors should demonstrate how they will promote SAMHSA's focus on disseminating effective interventions rather than generating new ones, support performance monitoring systems, assess impact of fidelity vs. adaptation on outcomes of treatment provider use of both KAP and non-KAP products, and provide input to the scientific community regarding new research priorities and service gaps for the substance abuse treatment field. Offerors shall also discuss their vision for the role of KAP in building a national dissemination network that links together existing training and technical assistance programs, and how KAP can generally support communities and providers to identify, implement, use, and evaluate best practices.

Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger). A copy of the company capability statement will also be accepted.  Responses are due on February 20, 2009. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four one year option periods. After review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and formal solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities.

9.	Provide a proven track record of organizational capability to quickly assemble groups of seminal experts on highly specialized clinical, administrative, and fiscal matters to analyze and resolve emerging issues without hesitation; and to evaluate and immediately revise products, programs, and services (and their approaches) for expanded and alternative uses in the substance abuse treatment field.

<DESC>The U.S. Government is conducting a Market Survey to identify production sources of 76mm Naval Ammunition used the with the MK75 Gun System. The manufacture of munitions will include all components and Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) including tanks and pallets. A respondent must be able to demonstrate technical information related to their products with associated manufacturing status.<BR><BR>	The U.S. Government has no requirements associated with acquisition of 76mm Naval Ammunition. This is intended to ascertain the World Wide Industrial Base for business case analysis purposes only. The current configurations of U.S. Naval munitions are described below. There will not be any Technical Data Package (TDP) available for this notice. There are six pictures attached for your reference.  Respondents can address equivalent functional configurations or propose alternate designs compatible with the MK75 Gun System.<BR><BR>	The 76mm cartridge ammunition is designed for US Navy Frigate usage. The ammunition is issued in the form of a fixed, completely assembled round, referred to as a cartridge. The 76mm cartridge consists of a steel cartridge case that contains a primer assembly and a propelling charge. The cartridge case is then crimped around an explosive loaded projectile body and a fuze is assembled to the cartridge. The Cartridge case, Primer, propelling charge and projectile body is common to all the cartridges. The fuze is a NATO Standard Fuze that may use either a Variable Time with InfraRed (IR), Radio Frequency (RF), Controlled Variable Time (CVT) and Point Detonating (PD).<BR><BR>The 76MM cartridges with a NATO Standard Fuze configurations are  <BR><BR>MK199 High Explosive, Infrared (HE-IR):<BR>	The MK404 passive infrared fuze provides a fragmentation capability against aircraft and surface targets.<BR><BR>MK200 High Explosive, Point Detonating (HE-PD):<BR>The MK407 fuze was designed for use against surface targets.<BR><BR>MK208 High Explosive, Variable Time (HE-VT):<BR>The MK417 fuze was designed for use against targets vulnerable to an air-burst which includes aircraft.<BR><BR>MK230 High Explosive, Controlled Variable Time (HE-CVT):<BR>The M732 fuze was designed for use against light surface targets. <BR><BR>MK201 Blind Loaded and Plugged (BL-P):<BR>The standard projectile body is filled with inert material to bring it within the weight tolerance of the service projectile. The nose is fitted with an inert (dummy) fuze. These cartridges are for target practice, ranging, and proving ground tests.<BR><BR>MK76 Clearing Charge:<BR>The clearing charge uses all components common to the 76MM cartridge assembly except that the cartridge case is shortened approximately 3.5 inches prior to assembly and a second polyethylene wad is inserted on the top in place of a projectile. The full assessed propellant load is used to ensure adequate pressure to reset even a worn gun.

<DESC><p>SUBJECT: FIESTACROW 09: - "EW &amp; CYBER... Global Spectrum Control"
<p>Description: The Billy Mitchell Chapter (BMC) of the Association of Old Crows, along with support from the Joint Information Operations Warfare Command, the Air Force Information Operations Center, Air Force ISR Agency, the 67th Network Warfare Wing, the 563 Flying Training Squadron and the Alamo Chapter of AFCEA, will present the 16th FIESTACROW technical symposium. FIESTACROW 09 will be held April 19-23, 2009 in San Antonio, Texas. The theme of the symposium is "EW &amp; CYBER... Global Spectrum Control". Electronic Warfare (EW) has evolved beyond the traditional thinking of self protection pods, air defense systems, and radars. Our everyday lives operate within a spectrum that is driven by EW technology. Whether we realize it or not, every time we use our cell phones, wireless routers, Global Positioning Systems, electronic banking, etc., we are vulnerable to exploitation, deception, and privacy invasion. Just as we defend our personal interests, we must also defend our national interests. EW technology is even more essential to the day-to-day operations of the modern battlefield. The technology behind today's EW systems blurs the lines between our normal daily routine and what the warfighter encounters in low intensity conflicts to the point that there is no clear distinction between them. Separating military and civil use of the EW spectrum becomes next to impossible. Homeland defense and information operations are two other areas where EW is pivotal in their operations and effectiveness. EW is more than the medium that holds these missions together; it facilitates, enhances, and amplifies them. The role of EW in Cyber warfare is far reaching and fundamental in global spectrum control. A classified session will be held on Thursday, April 23rd. This leading edge technical program will explore topics within this broad category.</p>
<p>Speakers for the program include: Lt Gen Ted Bowlds, Commander, ESC; Maj Gen Thomas Owen, Director, Logistics and Sustainment, AFMC; Col Laurie Buckhout, Chief, EW Division, HQDA G3; Visit the Fiestacrow Web site: http:// www.BMCAOC.org. click on Fiestacrow 2009 for update information the location, times and presenter information for both the technical session and classified sessions.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The exhibits area will be open Monday, April 20, 3:00 PM - 6:30 PM, Tuesday, April 21, 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM, and Wednesday, April 22, 11:00AM - 2:30 PM and 5:00 PM - 6:30 PM. In conjunction with FIESTACROW, an Industry Day with participants from Air Force ISR Agency, the Joint Information Operations Warfare Command, the Air Force Information Operations Center, and the City of San Antonio will be held on Tuesday morning, 21 April, at the convention center.<br />.</p>
<p>FIESTACROW 09 technical program, as usual, is held in conjunction with the San Antonio Fiesta. Coupled with the San Antonio hospitality during Fiesta, the parties that surround it, the River Parade and an elegant Grand Banquet, this is one event not to be missed.<br />For information on FIESTACROW 09, contact the Billy Mitchell Chapter at 210-732-7697 or visit the web site, www.BMCAOC.org. click on Fiestacrow 2009.</p>

<p class="layout"><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p class="layout">Printable electronics enable a host of new applications that
require flexible, conformal, and/or large area form factors.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, they create an opportunity to
leverage the high-throughput, manufacturing techniques (such as roll-to-roll
and ink jet printing) developed by the printing industry for low cost products.<span>&nbsp; </span>A major challenge for printable electronics
is producing circuits that have moderate to high performance. <span>&nbsp;</span>The Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency's (DARPA) Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) is requesting information
on novel research ideas and approaches for producing printable operational
amplifiers (op-amps) with performance equivalent of a 741 op-amp. <span>&nbsp;</span>No funding has currently been allocated to
this effort, a Broad Agency Announcement and/or other solicitation may or may
not result from the findings of this RFI.</p>
<p class="layout">The technology for printable electronics has been a focus of
recent research.<span>&nbsp; </span>Usually a simple
transistor device was made and tested.<span>&nbsp; </span>Where
circuits were made, they were relatively simple and low performance.<span>&nbsp; </span>There have also been many reports of the
solution processing of materials that has not included printing.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="layout">DARPA/MTO is interested in printable electronic circuits that enable
operational amplifiers that have performance that equals or exceeds that of a
741 op amp preferably using organic materials or utilizing printable
organic/inorganic material structures and devices.<span>&nbsp; </span>In order to focus onto approaches to those
with the greatest potential, a preliminary target is a 741 class of op amp
where all of the components are printed.<span>&nbsp; </span><strong>All of the metrics of a 741 op amp
are minimum specifications for the printed op-amp</strong> and exceeding some
metrics is encouraged as long as all of the other specifications are met.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of the metrics for a 741 op amp are:</p>

The Internal Revenue Service intends to award on a sole source basis a delivery order for consulting services, to a single GSA Schedule contractor.  This purchase order will be made under the Authority of FAR Part 8.404 – Use of Federal Supply Schedules.

<DESC>The Department of State, Office of Acquisition, intends to use Other Than Full and Open Competition under the authority 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements to extend American Systems Corporation contract SAQMPD07D0010 for an additional 3 months (March 20, 2009 - June 20, 2009).

American Systems currently provides classified and unclassified cable and conduit installation and repair services to the US Department of State (DOS).  Due to the nature of the requirements and the immediate response needed by the contractor to perform in a quick and proficient manner it is essential that the contractor be familiar with the cabling infrastructure needed to support the Department of State.  American Systems poses the critical historical knowledge of the DOS cabling infrastructure necessary to respond to urgent requirements in a timely and accurate manner.  The current contract is scheduled to expire March 19, 2009, disruption in services will cause unacceptable delays that would severely impact Department of State’s ability to meet the frequent urgent requirements needed to support DOS.  In addition the extension of the contract will allow enough time to commence with an 8(a) competitive set-a-side performance based contract and allow transition for the successful offeror.

<DESC>The subject contract was awarded on 19 Oct 2004 with a 2 year base period ofperformance for $10,355,722 cost, $793,188 fee and 161,280 hours (Total$11,148,910). The rate or costs committed against that ceiling exceededexpectations and the contract option was awarded on 14 FEB 2006 (8 monthsearly). Early award and extension of the option for $16,499,625 cost,$1,275,086 fee and 241,920 hours (Total $17,724,711) allowed the Government tokeep the original contract end date unchanged. Later when the remainingcontract ceiling was not sufficient to provide services pending a newsolicitation and award of a follow on procurement, a cost increase of$9,144,816 was implemented, service hours were increased by 80,260, and theperiod of performance end date was shortened by 10 months to 18 Dec 2008. Afollow on acquisition plan was completed, an RFP issued, proposals received,evaluations performed, an award was announced, and an award protest wasreceived.  Additional time is needed to resolve the protest. Due to this, theGovernment intends to extend the current contract through 17 Oct 2009 (theoriginal POP end date), and to increase the ceiling by approximately$2,000,000.
If the ceiling of this contract is not increased and the POP extended, theGovernment will be without essential contractor support to provide services tothe SSC PAC customers. This would result in unacceptable delays to projects andsupport to the warfighter.

This is a special notice for commercial services prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(b)(1), Only one source is capable of responding due to the uniqueness or specialized nature of the work.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated, however a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Department Of Veterans Affairs, VISN 15 Contracting Office intends to establish an IDIQ contract to purchase, sole-source, from Kinetic Concepts, Inc, Wound VAC and Info VAC Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Systems. These units are the only machines found by this agency which apply controlled, localized negative pressure to help uniformly draw wounds closed, help remove interstitial fluid allowing tissue decompression, help remove infectious materials, provide a closed moist wound healing environment, promote flap and graft survival, and have an adjustable dressing draw down intensity.   Characteristics also include the three foams which enable the following: The white foam can be used with exposed bone and fistulas as it is less porous and does not require further contact layers inside the wound bed to prevent shocking. The silver foam can be used with wounds that are more contaminated to prevent further bacterial growth.  The black foam can be cut exactly to the shape and size needed. The foams can be cut to the exact depth that is needed to prevent rolling or pinching of wound edges. The black foam can be cut to include openings within the black foam allowing the white foam to be filled in the open areas where there is increase risk for bleeding or over fistula sites. The foam is completely sealed within the wound bed using the drape before the disk is placed making a more closed system  Any contractor who wishes to offer their products in response to this sole-source announcement must submit their technical data to support their claim no later than April 2, 2009.  A fax or e-mail response will be accepted. Fax number is 913-758-6495.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

<DESC>Deteriorated Roof Leaks - - - S O W
The existing roofs of the cafeteria have developed numerous cracks which constanly leak and damage occupied spaces below.  These are areas on the roof where water migrates to the edge of the roof at the parapet wall creating bubbles.  The surface aggregate of both roofs has washed away and crickets have not been properly installed to direct water to scuppers.  The existing parapet metal caps are not properly secured and sealed.  In some areas the metal caps have been screwed to substrate hindering expansion and contraction movement.  Numerous attempts were made to correct leaking probelms without success.
Recommendations:
1.  Remove the existing roofing material, insulation, flashing, counter flashing and parapet caps.
2.  Install new mineral board and rigid insulation of R38.  Provide tapered insulation to provide positive drainage to scuppers.  Install new single ply as follows: approximately 25,000 SF Energy Star high reflectance and high emissivity, scrim-reinforced, thermiplastic ployolefin (TPO) .60 inch nominal thickness.  Provide tapered insulation to achieve positive slope to perimeter gutters.  Remove and replace all flashing and counter-flashing in teh affected areas (12" wide x 1,1130' long).  All work to be accomplished in accordance with the NRCA.  Provide roofing manufacturer's standards 20 year warranty.
3.  Provide flashing and counter flashing at the perimeter of the roof.  Flashing, as recommended by roofing manufacturer, to extend on the side and over the paraper walls.  Install snap-on pre-finished metal cap.
4.  Provide control and expansion joints whre required.  
5.  Wind roof design (150)  shall meet applicable local and national codes.  

Roof area is approsimately 25,000 SF
Buidling perimeter is 1,130 linear feet.

Walk-Thru is scheduled for Wednesday, March 25th,2009 at 10:00 a.m.

Provide a replacement electric water boiler of the same capacity as the existing.  Provide controls, electircal connections, water and drain piping.  (Existing electric boiler data:  Precision Parts Corporation, Model HWS5412V480-110, Serial Number 9504, Control: 3 steps of 30kW, 1 step of 20 kW).  Boiler must meet a high efficiency rating available at time of purchase. 

Walk-Thru is scheduled for Thursday, March 26th, 2009 at 10:00 a.m.

If needed, site visits will be done by APPOINTMENT ONLY and NO VISITS after Friday, 
March 27th, 2009.

<DESC><p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking innovative research &amp; development proposals through this broad agency announcement (BAA) for the Biometrics Exploitation Science and Technology (BEST) Program to significantly advance the state-of-the-science for biometrics technologies.  Technologies that are not of interest to the IARPA BEST Program are contact-type biometric technologies (i.e. fingerprint, palm, etc.) and ideas for product development or research that would primarily result in incremental, evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  The overarching goals for the IARPA BEST Program are: 1) to significantly advance the Intelligence Community's (IC) ability to achieve high-confidence match performance, even when the features are derived from non-ideal data; and 2) to significantly relax the constraints currently required to acquire high fidelity biometric signatures.</p>
<p>The IARPA BEST Program will consist of three phases over a five year period.  Phases 1 and 2 will be approximately 24 months each, and Phase 3 will be approximately 12 months.  Multiple awards are anticipated for Phase 1.  Each award for phase 1 is envisioned to consist of a one (1) year base period with one (1) option year.  Near the conclusion of Phase 1, proposals for Phases 2 and 3 of the Program will be requested through the issuance of a separate solicitation at that time.  This BAA solicits proposals for Phase 1 only.</p>
<p>Proposals are due by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on May 5, 2009.  For more information, please go to www.iarpa.gov/solicitations.html and click on the links for IARPA-BAA-09-02</p>

The HDB-155 antenna element is proprietary and the government does not have any schematic drawings. These antennas elements are installed in climates where severe snow and ice storms are routinely experienced and the HDB-155 antenna element design has demonstrated the ability to withstand severe weather conditions. The Government has purchased these units from Kathrein Inc., Scala Division for the past five years with excellent performance and reliability. This procurement will provide additional units for continued support and network expansion.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number:  Q8219091118.
This solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26. The National Park Service, Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona intends to award a Commercial Firm-Fixed Price contract for the following:  
GENERAL.  The National Park Service (NPS), Grand Canyon National Park (GRCA), will begin to initiate the on the ground actions required to implement the South Rim Visitor Transportation Plan (SRVTP) within the next month.  The plan calls for the construction of new parking lots at Grand Canyon Visitor Center, re-routing traffic into the new lots, and the demolition of portions of the road near Mather Point.  During this project, restoration or landscaping activities will occur on approximately 10 acres of land.  In an effort to maximize the age structure and accelerate the speed of plant community succession, 
The Grand Canyon National Park has a requirement for the salvage and storage of native tree material to support an ongoing construction project.  In this work statement, salvage refers to digging, root balling, and moving the trees off site.  This work requires a professional level of expertise to ensure salvaging of the trees  
STATEMENT OF WORK  The Contractor shall provide all logistics, labor, materials, transportation, supervision, and inspection to ensure in the salvage of native trees as defined below. a.	Contractor will provide for the professional digging of a total of 50 native trees (40 pinyon pine, 10 juniper); NPS staff will flag 70 trees to provide a cushion.b.	Contractor will prepare each tree for storage for 12 months (through April 15, 2010), which will require that each tree has a sufficient size root ball, that the root ball is either wrapped in burlap (preferred) or boxed.c.	Contractor will ensure that the salvaged trees fall into the following categories (50% in the 6-9' height category; 50% in the 9-12' height category).d.	Contractor will move / heal the 50 trees into on on-site soil berm provided by the NPS; soil berm will be within  mile of the salvage site.e.	Within five days after completion of work, Contractor shall provide GRCA Vegetation Program staff with written instructions regarding how to care for the trees for up to a 12 month period, with specific details for each season of the year.  GRCA will provide documentation that tree care methods are followed. f.	Contractor will provide overnight accommodations for the crew, if necessary.  Contractor's price shall be inclusive of all necessary logistics.  g.	Contractor will provide all equipment, tools, and transportation necessary to dig the trees, prepare the root balls for storage, and move the trees to the long-term storage site.h.	Contractor will ensure that all equipment and tools used for this project have been power washed and are free of plant / soil material.i.	Contractor will guarantee that a minimum of 90% of the 50 trees (45 total trees) will survive until they are ready to be transplanted (through April 15, 2010); after that time, the burden of survival will fall to the NPS.  Failure to meet the 90% survival rate will be subject to a deduction (0-10%) in the final payment.All OSHA regulations pertaining to the operation of heavy equipment must be followed by contractors involved in large tree salvage.  http://www.osha.gov3.	POTENTIAL HAZARDSThe work may need to be implemented during inclement weather conditions, including snow and extreme cold.  The ground substrate is Kaibab limestone, which presents an extremely challenging situation for large tree salvage and does present hazards when digging with equipment.  The project site is in a location where a road / parking lot will be constructed; at this time, no roads exist and access to the site will require off road travel.  Work crews may encounter wildlife in GRCA.   Because of the noise of machinery, California condors may become curious and fly around the job site area.  If you see a California condor, notify the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) immediately so that person can take the appropriate steps.  4.	STAGING THE WORKThe Contractor shall avoid ground disturbance outside the project area and will ensure that no damage to the ground, resources, or objects located outside of the flagged / fenced construction zone occurs.5.	GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED MATERIALS/SERVICESThe Government will provide the following materials/services:a.	A minimum of 70 trees will be flagged, allowing the Contractor 20 trees to help ensure that the 90% survival rate is met.  For example, the contractor must guarantee that 45 trees survive up to one year in the berm, so salvaging additional trees beyond the 50 requested will increase the potential to meet this requirement.  If the Contractor would like to propose another methodology to ensure survival, please provide in bid package.b.	The COR will provide an orientation to the project site, including the storage berm.6.	DELIVERY SCHEDULEContractor must complete all work and be off-site no later than 30 April 2009.7.	BID FORMATProvide breakdown by size category, and a final total for the full project, including all associated costs.8.	SUMMARY OF DELIVERABLESNative tree salvage as described above.9.

<DESC>This performance-based Request for Proposal has been developed by the Social Security Administration (SSA) for the purpose of upgrading and procuring two Social Security Number (SSN) card printers with the option of two additional printers.  SSA is currently utilizing two IBM 6262 impact printers to produce 80,000 SSN cards per day across multiple shifts.  These printers are dated technology with high maintenance cost, hard to find replacement parts, and pose an increased risk of disruption to SSA’s card production workload.  With the number of printed cards expected to increase, the need to develop an alternative commercially available solution is imperative to ensure stability, security and high availability of SSA’s SSN card print technology.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 for commercial items, with a notice of intent to issue a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Federal News Service, Inc., 1000 Vermont Ave, NW FRNT1, Washington DC 20005-4903, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The resulting contract will be awarded on a sole source basis to the Federal News Service, Inc., for the justification here stated: “The two month service agreement sought with the Federal News Service will provide the necessary time to properly compete and award a new contract (a base year with several option years).  The DMC Contracting Activty is in the process of conducting a full and open competitive procurement for similar services that will result in a long term award for the requreid services. Delays with this procurement have been caused by 1) failure to obtain contractual authority in the form of a contract extension via the Army’s Center for Contracting Excellence, through which the previous contract was awarded.  That extension was sought in order to prepare a new RFP, evaluate proposals, and award a new contract; and 2) confusion on the part of the Contracting Officer Technical Representative on how to rectify the situation.  An award to another vendor would cause great disruption in services and additional costs which are unlikely to be recovered as a result of competition. Moreover, this contract award is limited to only that short timeframe needed to complete a proper full and open competition. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>Non-Federal Repository Booklet

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Part 12 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990 with a small business size standard of $6.5million in annual gross receipts for a period of three years. 

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Center for Acquisition Services (PGE), is requesting services for the Non- Federal Repository Booklet project.   

Background:  

The purpose of this specific project is to update the GSA Fine Arts Program collection listings that have been added or modified since the publication of the WPA Artwork in Non-Federal repositories, Edition II book in 1999.  The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 transferred all functions of the Federal Works Agency, including New Deal artwork, to the General Services Administration.  Included in the delegated functions is the responsibility of inventorying the works of art created under the federal government’s patronage during the 1930s and 1940s.  

Accordingly, the Fine Arts Program abides by the legal framework laid out in Chapter 3 of the Fine Arts Program Policies & Procedures document regarding the New Deal art collections housed in non-federal repositories.

 
Required Services (Scope):  

This inventory project is to establish a comprehensive listing of New Deal portable artwork for research purposes, to ensure their preservation, and to extend public access and awareness of this period. The GSA Fine Art’s Program maintains the database so that the records are preserved in a central location and are available to researchers, conservators, and museums.  

To date, over 18,000 WPA artworks have been recovered and added to the inventory and many more have been discovered that need to be included.  As the central repository for these artworks, it is essential that the GSA locate, document and keep track of the remaining artworks so that they will continue to be available to the American public for which they were created.  There are still thousands of artworks left to be uncovered and adequately documented.  Several non-federal repositories have WPA collections numbering in the hundreds and even thousands which will require a significant amount of attention.  The major institutions that need to be addressed are the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and several New Mexico area institutions.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

The small business standard is 1000 employees. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30 (Effective on February 17, 2009). DESCRIPTION: The requirement is for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) type purchase order; Contract Line Item No. (CLIN) 0001 is to provide Naval Security Boat refurbishment for one (UB-02) 19UB9220 19' BOSTON WHALER; CLIN 0002: refurbish one (UB-03) 19UB9221 BOSTON WHALER; CLIN!  0003: refurbish one (SCI-6) 28OP9710 WILLARD OIL SKIMMER; CLIN 0004: refurbish one (BMR 3) SLICK BAR OIL BOOM BOAT; CLIN 0005:  refurbish one (WHLR-7) 19UB9506 BOSTON WHALER; CLIN 0006: refurbish one (MSF 2) 18UB8621 BOSTON WHALER.  Period of performance:  03/31/2009 through 07/15/2009.  Refer to Attachment (1) for the entire statement of work. Work to be accomplished at contractor's facility. Offeror shall provide the facility name, street address, city, state, and zip code where the work is to be accomplished, with their quote. PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Packaging and preservation shall be performed in accordance with the best commercial practices to afford maximum protection against damage. DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Items shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work. Offerors shall include in their quote the cost of transportation of the boats. Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government! . 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) past performance and (ii) price. Past performance when compared to price is approximately equal in importance. (b) Options (not applicable). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The total evaluated price will be the sum of CLINs 0001-0006. The Government will evaluate the proposed price fo! r reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.4. The Government will also determine the realism and balance of each price by comparing it to other proposed prices and the independent government estimate. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror has satisfied customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Offeror's past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the following subfactors (of past performance) which are of equal importance: 1. Technical (Quality of Product) - expected performance of the technical requirements of the subject availability based upon an offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 2. Schedule - expected performance in meeting the schedule requirements of the subject availability based upon a offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts a! nd the effectiveness if any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 3. Management - the expected performance in managing the subject availability based upon an offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. This includes an evaluation of the offeror's past performance in complying with the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The Government's evaluation of your past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on performance evaluations available in the automated Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), information obtained from your references during telephone interviews and/or performance questionnaires, and information available in the Government's local files to evaluate past performance. The Government may use other sources, as appropriate. The Government will consider performance of work that you have subcontracted to another firm as your past performance. However, the Government will not conside! r the past performance of a proposed subcontractor, unless that performance was under a subcontract awarded by you. The Government will give greater consideration to contracts requiring the same or similar type and complexity of work required by the RFQ. However, other types of contracts/work may be considered as part of the past performance evaluation as well, if aspects of the past performance are deemed to have some bearing on the expected performance of the subject solicitation. Prepare and submit one Reference Information Sheet for each of the contracts that you would like the Government to consider when evaluating your past performance in the format of Attachment (2). The contracts that you reference must be ongoing or have been completed within the last three years. On the Reference Information Sheet, include the names of references who can verify that you have done the type of work that is required under the contract contemplated by this RFQ and who will provide inf! ormation about the quality of your past performance. However, the Government may not contact all of your references. If a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) has been completed for one or more of the contracts that you would like to reference, you need not submit a Reference Information Sheet for those contracts. Instead, you may provide a list of such contracts. Make sure that your reference information is up to date and that each reference will cooperate with us. Do not give us the names of a reference unless you have made sure that we can reach that reference at the telephone number, e-mail address, and postal address that you have provided, and that they will give us the information that we want. Offerors shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. Quotes shall state the unit prices and total prices of the items required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-c! ompliant. Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make an offeror ineligible for award. The FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process to satisfy FAR 52.212-3. More information on ORCA is found at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx. Offerors who've completed ORCA should notify the contract specialist before solicitation's closing date and time so it can be downloaded by the procuring contracting office.

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) contract for maintenance dredging to the Shinnecock Inlet located off the south shore of Long Island (approximately 95 miles by water from Battery, New York). This project consists of furnishing all plant, labor, materials and equipment. This effort involves dredging to a depth of 20 feet, plus 2 feet allowable over depth, along with the removal of approximately 440,500 cubic yards of shoal material. The dredged material is to be placed on the shoreline approximately 6,500 to 8,400 feet west of the site by an ocean going hydraulic dredge. Performance of all work must be in strict accordance with the specifications and drawings. The selected contractor will be required to diligently commence work within 5 calendar days and complete the work no later than 90 calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). The time stated for completion includes final cleanup of the premises. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 24 MAR 2009 with bid opening on/about 8 JUN 2009.</p>

 HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

    (v) Others similar interests.

<DESC>The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) currently has two general support systems (GSSs) supporting the computer applications of the agency and six major applications (MAs).  The two GSSs are designated as the “Local Area Network/Personal Computers” (LAN/PC) and the “Mainframe Computer Data Processing” systems.  The six MAs are the RR Employees Compensation and Service, Financial Interchange, RRA Payments, RUIA Payments, Medicare, and Financial Management systems.  Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance provided in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60, both GSSs and all six MAs have been categorized as having the moderate level of risk for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  Both GSSs and five of the MAs have been certified and accredited. The Financial Management application is currently undergoing the certification and accreditation (C&A) process.  

The RRB seeks contractual assistance to develop and implement a continuous monitoring program in compliance with NIST standards and to consolidate existing documentation for four related MAs, RR Employees Compensation and Service, RRA Payments, RUIA Payments, and Medicare into one system entitled Benefit and Payment Operations.  Optionally, the contractor may be called upon to produce policy/procedure documents for the RRB’s review and approval and to perform re-certification and accreditation processes for various RRB general support systems and major applications.

The period of performance is anticipated to start September 1, 2009.  A contract shall be awarded for one year with four one-year options.

Potential offerors should submit their letter of interest to Velinda.nix@rrb.gov.

<DESC>The subject synopsis is being amended to change the estimated date for release of the solicitation to April 2009, to change the estimated dollar value, and to update the requirements as stated below:

The objective of this solicitation is to establish a Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Performance Based Service Contract(s) for Newborn Screening services to test for 53 inherited, metabolic disorders.  The supply/service portion of the initiative will be firm-fixed and not subject adjustment during the life of the contract.  The transportation of collected specimen samples from the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) to the contractor’s laboratory will be subject to an Economic Price Adjustment.  The goal of Department of Defense (DoD) Newborn Screening Program is to obtain a comprehensive, centralized laboratory for Newborn Screening services in order to improve efficiencies, standardize the newborn screening benefit, ensure quality, and achieve best value in laboratory testing. The successful contractor(s) will be required to conduct newborn screening laboratory tests for all neonates born within military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) worldwide and for any neonatal specimen collected at an MTF during a follow-up medical appointment.

This procurement will be awarded using “Best Value” Source Selection Procedures to a maximum of (2) two vendors. One vendor will be responsible for servicing the Continental United States/Alaska/Hawaii (CONUS/AK/HI) region and one vendor to service the Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) region.  Based on the results of the evaluation one award may be made to the same vendor for both the CONUS/AK/HI and OCONUS regions.

The DSCP Electronic Catalog will be the sole means by which orders for the Newborn Screening will be placed, confirmed and invoiced under this contract. The unit price for the Specimen Collection Kit must be included in the price per unit of the Newborn Screening Services identified in this procurement.  

The contractor is required to perform Newborn Screening testing for the 53 disorders (see Attachment 1).  As new disorders are made in the field of Newborn Screening, the disorder or testing procedure may be added to the successful vendor(s) contract on a post award basis.  

The contract will encompass the following services for each newborn:
• Provision of specimen collection kits and all necessary supplies 
• Timely transport of collected specimens (applies to vendors who offer this as FOB Destination)
• Accurate and timely laboratory testing of specimens
• Accurate and timely interpretation of test results
• Accurate and timely, comprehensive reporting/communication of results
• Data management
• Technical assistance
• Clinical consultation to laboratory and clinical staff within the Military Health Care System
• Follow-up services
• Participation in quality assurance programs and reporting of quality assurance data 

For all elements of Laboratory Testing and Analysis, the contractor shall comply with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA 88), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for medical devices, and all other applicable Federal and State regulations.   As part of their proposal offerors are required to provide a copy of their CLIA license or certificate. 

Award of the CONUS/AK/HI region will be evaluated separately from the OCONUS region.  Vendors may submit proposals to service the CONUS/AK/HI and OCONUS regions individually or collectively.  However, all MTFs located within these regions must be serviced to be considered for award.  Vendors technical and price proposals will be evaluated using “Best Value” Source Selection Procedures.   Technical Merit will be considered more important than price.  This procurement will be awarded to a maximum of (2) two vendors. One vendor will be responsible for servicing CONUS/AK/HI MTFs and the other vendor will service OCONUS MTFs.  Based on the results of the evaluation one award may be made to the same vendor for both the CONUS/AK/HI and OCONUS regions. 

The term of the contract(s) will be a (1) one year Base Ordering Period with four (4) one-year unilateral Option Ordering Periods.  This procurement has an estimated value of $2.8 million annually ($13.9 over the full five years) for the CONUS/AK/HI region, and $0.4 million annually ($2.0 million over the full five years) for the OCONUS region. 

Solicitation SPM2D1-07-R-0002 is expected to be issued April 2009 and can be found on the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/ .

<DESC>NOTE: The Presolicitation Notice for Solicitation 270-09-0309 has been canceled due to an incorrect number.  The correct solicitation number should be 270-09-0307.


PRESOLICITATION NOTICE:

The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a 12 month cost reimbursement contract with four (4) 12 month option periods entitled Knowledge Application Program (KAP).   The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment’s (CSAT) grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts are designed to develop knowledge on best practices in substance abuse treatment.  In 1999, CSAT implemented a systematic program to synthesize, publish, and disseminate this knowledge to the substance abuse (SA) treatment and related fields through the Knowledge Application Program (KAP).  KAP has been responsible for production of CSAT’s premiere publication series, Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs). The current KAP has also been charged with considering the most effective formats for presenting TIPs to each of its intended audiences, and determining whether the specialized knowledge contained in the TIPs is actually reaching and being adopted by those most in need of that knowledge.  

The current KAP contract has begun to address the need for SA treatment knowledge to be synthesized and packaged in different ways depending on the target audience.  For example, new formats known as “collateral products” have been developed to supplement the standard TIP document in order to better meet the needs of some audiences. The existing KAP program was built on the following premises: 1) Treatment information needs to be presented to target audiences through a range of media and learning approaches including interactive workshops, Internet training courses and videos, as well as the traditional training classes and written publications; and 2) To be most useful, information must be specifically tailored to the particular needs of specialized provider groups and must also be culturally relevant when appropriate.

KAP must support the strong emphasis at SAMHSA on the Science to Services and Workforce Development initiatives.  KAP will continue to address a number of diverse knowledge application activities in a cost effective and coordinated manner.  These activities will include publishing, communicating, and disseminating products to enhance quality of treatment services.  Successful implementation of the science to services cycle requires a strong monitoring and feedback component. Within the context of this requirement, offerors should demonstrate how they will promote SAMHSA's focus on disseminating effective interventions rather than generating new ones, support performance monitoring systems, assess impact of fidelity vs. adaptation on outcomes of treatment provider use of both KAP and non-KAP products, and provide input to the scientific community regarding new research priorities and service gaps for the substance abuse treatment field. Offerors shall also discuss their vision for the role of KAP in building a national dissemination network that links together existing training and technical assistance programs, and how KAP can generally support communities and providers to identify, implement, use, and evaluate best practices.  

The estimated date of issuance of the RFP is April 01, 2009 with proposals responses, by April 30, 2009.  This solicitation maybe obtained in any of three ways; by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1051, Rockville, MD 20852; or FedBizOps.  Files will not be made available until on or after the estimated issuance date.  Once downloaded, you should determine if you have a continuing interest in the RFP.  If so, you must either write the individual identified below and request a copy of the amendments to the RFP (if any) be sent to you by mail, or check the Web regularly for amendments which will also be posted at FedBizOps and can be downloaded electronically. 

NOTE: If you rely on the Web for obtaining the RFP amendments, SAMHSA has no way to assure, and therefore assume no responsibility for assuring that you have downloaded these documents. All RFP requests must include the RFP number and be in writing.  Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after the twentieth day will reach the requestor before the due date for receipt of responses.  Requests shall be forwarded to the attention of Andrew Payne, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts, OPS, Substance Abuse and Mental health Services Administration, DHHS, 1 Choke Cherry Road, room 7-1051, Rockville, Maryland 20857.  Requests may be sent via fax to (240) 276-1510, but please confirm by phone that your fax request has been received.   Electronic mail and telephone requests will not be honored.  *****

The Government intends to solicit proposals from Southern Automotive Wholesalers, Inc. (SAW) and CME ARMA, Inc.  SAW, Cage 1Y875, is the current source for this commercial item.  The Starter Engine is used in the 5 KW and 10 KW MIL STD Generator Sets. We intend to issue solicitation W15P7T-09-R-A006 on or about 23 March 2009. Presolite Electric Corporation (Presolite) designed and is the Original Equipment Manufacturer for the required engine starter. Onan, the prime contractor for the MEP-002 and the MEP-003 MIL-STD generators, selected Presolites engine starter for these generators.  Presolite no longer manufactures this engine starter. Both SAW and CME ARMA have commercial engine starters that are form, fit, and functionally (F3) interchangeable with the original Presolite engine starter.  The Governments technical experts would waive FAT for this item for SAW or CME ARMA based upon pre-qualification results and the Government's time constraints for filling the requirement. The minimum guaranteed quantity is 220 starter engines.  The Government intends to order a maximum quantity of 3,000 starter engines over the period of performance of this contract. This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal; however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, AND ANSWERS

3.4 SECTION 4: TECHNICAL APPROACH AND WORK PLAN
Describe in detail the proposed technical approach and work plan. Discuss the project requirements as perceived by the Offeror. Include a brief narrative of tasks within each activity series. Begin with the information gathering phase and continue through delivery and approval of all required reports.
Prepare a detailed schedule of performance that describes all activities and tasks within the Technical Work Plan, including periodic reporting or review points, incremental delivery dates, and other project milestones.
Based on the Technical Work Plan, and previous project experience, explain when and where Offeror will require support from the Grantee. Detail the amount of staff time required by the Grantee or participating agencies and any work space or facilities needed to complete the Study

Comment:
The type of work plan being described in 3.4 Section 4 is common to an implementation or construction project where the scope of work is clearly defined and there are few variables.  This project however is a feasibility study in which the final outcomes (deliverables) are defined however the scope of work can only be estimated.  For example we do not know how many IT systems current exist at the agencies involved.  In the Proposals submitted we can explain the processes that will be used to accomplish each task (1-8) and provide milestone dates; for each deliverable, when our teams would be in country studying, and comment periods.  It is not realistic to assume the contractor can provide the level of detail required in 3.4 of Section 4 without actually seeing the systems involved.   Detailing staff time required at each agency/location, defining each subtask and activity, setting additional periodic reporting or review points is not feasible without detailed information on the IT systems that will be part of the overall ICT Network.  If such a work plan was submitted we would expect numerous contract modifications would need to be made as the study progressed and the true nature of the system and the challenges in linking them was determined.
We recommend that Section 3.4 Section 4 be removed.  The RFP specifies that the bidders must explain how they will accomplished the tasks including submission of deliverables.  A statement that the bidders should submit a schedule defining when work on each task will start/stop, deliverables will be submitted, comments periods, and when team members will be on-site could be added.

Answer:
In general, please keep in mind that this feasibility study is the first step in a more detailed process, and that the study budget should provide an indication to bidders of the level of effort expected for the tasks.  Additionally, the work plan submitted in the proposal will not automatically be incorporated into the contract.  

TASK 1: Network Infrastructure Assessment
In the text is the following “Based on inputs from the two organizations, the Contractor shall propose a plan and timetable for the full integration of the Grantee's national backbone network with CoM's metropolitan networks throughout the country, addressing both technical and organizational issues”
“Deliverable: The Contractor shall develop a preliminary Grantee/CoM Network Assessment and Integration Plan, including; a definition of services and how they relate to mission and technical objectives; a baseline assessment of the current network infrastructure with respect to network and service capabilities, capacity utilization, infrastructure requirements, operations, and implementation planning requirements; and identification of major gaps in the existing network status and future development plans”

Comment:
The contractor is being asked to propose an Integration Plan before the assessments and evaluations in Tasks 2-6 are conducted.  The section is titled Network Infrastructure Assessment which is the logical first step in a project of this nature.  If the text quoted & underlined above was removed from the Task 1 description and the words “and Integration Plan” were removed from the Deliverable text the flow of work would be orderly.

Answer:
The contractor should view this as a preliminary integration plan that will be refined/modified as the other tasks are completed.

TASK 2: Interoperability, Reliability, and Security Assessment
In the text is the following “The Contractor shall assess current security systems, develop a top-level security architecture for the enhanced network (including, but not limited to, encryption, access control, hash & digital signature), and develop a set of policy, organization and implementation recommendations for the security system”

Comment: This is a feasibility study and the development of architecture is being specified, yet it is not required as a deliverable.  The development of the architecture can be a costly venture and in this case highly difficult to estimate since the size of the system, its functions and applications are unknown to the bidders.

Answer:
The budget for this activity provides only for the feasibility study, not project implementation.   A relatively high-level analysis is expected in the feasibility study.

TASK 3: Enterprise Architecture Development
In the text is the following “Based on the technical conclusions from Tasks 1 and 2, and on detailed discussions with the Grantee, the CoM, and other ministries agencies, the Contractor shall develop the framework for the creation of a Government-wide Enterprise Architecture.”
“Deliverable: The Contractor shall develop an Enterprise Architecture Governance Model and institutional Framework Guide for the Bulgarian National ICT Network. This report should integrate key technical network elements and connectivity, interoperability, and capacity issues from Tasks 1 and 2 into a broader management, institutional capacity, services organization and planning document.”

Question:
Is the contractor to develop a Framework for the creation of a Government-wide Enterprise Architecture or are they developing the Enterprise Architecture Governance Model?

Answer:
The latter. The words ‘framework’ and ‘model’ are used synonymously.  Again, this will be a high-level plan to provide guidance and key concepts.

TASK 4: Economic and Financial Analysis
In the text is the following “The Contractor shall conduct an economic analysis of the project, which should provide information regarding economic contingencies, market conditions for technologies and network services, supply and sourcing agreements, alternative methods of achieving desired network functionality, or any other economic parameters that could impact on the potential successful implementation of the national ICT network.”

Comment:  On a project of this nature a contractor can provide Rough Orders of Magnitude (ROM) on the cost of a system, training, maintenance, and operations.  They can also explore sources of available financing.  An analysis of economic contingencies and market conditions for technologies is in and of itself a project that would, if properly conducted, nearly equal the cost of this contract.  Is this intended?

Answer:
Yes, ROM estimates and exploring financing sources are appropriate.  Again, the budget for this feasibility study should be an indication of the level of effort expected.
