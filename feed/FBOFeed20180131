<DESC><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Project Description/Synopsis</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The US Department of Labor (DOL) seeks the services of a qualified 8(a) and all small business concerns for the Design and Construction Administration (CA) Services for the Gulfport Redevelopment at the Gulfport Job Corps Center in Gulfport, Mississippi.<br /><br />The work consists of design and construction administration (CA) services for the multi-phase construction of four new buildings with historic preservation requirements, as stipulated by execution of recent Memorandum of Agreement between the U.S. Department of Labor, The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and the City of Gulfport. &nbsp;There are substantial public interface, presentation, and outreach requirements for the project for which the Architect/Engineer team will be primarily responsible. &nbsp;Two of the four buildings will need to be integrated into the design of the two new building. &nbsp;The facades to be retained will be required to be temporarily supported once the remainder of the buildings of which they are currently part are demolished. &nbsp;Due to the size of the new building footprints required to satisfy building program requirements, it is anticipated that geotechnical testing and a full replacement of existing on-site utilities and surface features will be required. &nbsp;The design will also need to be phased for construction into a least two distinct phases due to the need to keep the existing operating Job Corps Center functioning. &nbsp;Design services may include site adaptation, code compliance update, and minor revisions for historic preservation architectural features for the prior designs of two of the four buildings for which facade retention is not an issue, and entirely new designs for the two buildings which will be integrated with the facades to be retained. &nbsp;All four buildings will be located&nbsp;on approximately five acres. &nbsp;Federal mandates affecting energy usage and storm water management will also be applied to the project, among others. &nbsp;The site is a leased site, and performance of a design which results in a local building permit will be required, as coordinated through the City&rsquo;s Building Department during the course of design. &nbsp;Also included in the design services is the testing required to evaluate the condition and design proper bracing of the existing facades, as well as inclusion of hazardous and other material abatement in the project specifications. &nbsp;Estimate Value of the construction to be designed is over $10,000,000.</p>

The NAVSUP Weapons Systems Support is soliciting a repair requirement for a Valve Rotary Select, NSN:  4810 015040265. Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government. June 2016 is the estimated award date of the resultant stand- alone contract.  
 
The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not  been determined adequate to support manufacture or repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the government for procurement of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in manufacture or repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your copy of the cover letter forwarded with your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">NAICS Code: 811219 Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current contract, EP-D-12-003, as described below.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The US Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) has installed one and hundred and thirty-nine monitoring stations at outdoor locations, where they continuously collect particulate matter in ambient air on fixed filters. Operators at the stations perform basic operations, primarily starting and stopping the air sampler to change filters. At most locations, a mechanical or instrument technician is not available to correct problems. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">During normal operations, filters are changed by a local operator and mailed to EPA laboratory for analysis. During sample collection, the monitoring stations continuously monitor the filter for accumulation of radioactive material. The radiation measurements are stored by the monitoring station and transmitted, both automatically and on demand, via communications systems that are an integral pat of the monitoring station, to the EPA&rsquo;s National Analytical Radiation Environmental Laboratory (NAREL), in Montgomery, Alabama. Whenever deemed necessary, NAREL remotely connects with one or more monitoring stations to initiate transfer of additional data and/or to modify operation parameters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent contractor provides the on-site maintenance and repair of these monitors. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The current contract, EP-D-12-003, period of performance was extended for six months from December 11, 2016 to June 11, 2017 via Far Clause 52.217-8&mdash;Option to Extend Services. The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award a follow on contract for a one-year base period and two one-year option periods in accordance with the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR). However, due to delays in the acquisition process, the contract for follow on services will not be awarded prior to the current expiration date of June 11, 2017 of contract EP-D-12-003. Since the services of the contract are critical and cannot lapse, the EPA must extend the period of performance of the current contract for an additional three months, with three (3) 1-month optional extension periods to allow time for the new follow on contract to be awarded. The EPA intends to negotiate, this period of performance extension on a sole source basis.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">There are no other contractors that have the capability of providing the level, breath, depth of support, and continuity of services that are required by ORIA in order to maintain the one hundred and thirty-nine monitoring stations at the outdoor locations, where they continuously collect particulate matter in ambient air on fixed filters. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This notice will be posted for 5 days. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The intent of this notice alerts the vendor community to the extension of contract EP-D-12-003, and the upcoming opportunity for competition of this opportunity. This notification alerts all vendors to this action and to determine if any other source (s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is viable. Responses to this notice should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Jeffery Clodfelter via the following e-mail address (</span><a href="mailto:Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">) within <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">5 days</strong> from the date of this notice.</span></p>

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a SPP agreement, ACT agreement, or CRADA agreement.
<p>THE TECHNOLOGY:  Please see US Patents 9,447,315 and 9,873,828.  Also please see publications Geothermics, 2015, 58, 22 and Green Chem 2015,17,2799.</p>
<p>Hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") utilizes millions of gallons of hydraulic fluids (typically water, with certain additives) under high pressure for oil and gas well stimulation.</p>
<p>As an alternative, poly(allylamine) aqueous solution ("PAA") undergoes a chemically induced reaction with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form a hydrogel with a large and rapid 100% volume expansion and 15x viscosity increase.  This volume expansion readily and reliably fractures subterranean rock at an effective pressure of 100 psi.  The process is rheoreversible and release of the CO2 pressure reverses the expansion and viscosity increase, thus allowing for the fluid to be removed from the well and re-used.</p>
<p>The polymer is used at a 1% concentration.  Proppants are used as for conventional fracking.</p>
<p>Depending upon the polymer used, the rheological properties can be tailored to the specific application to aid in oil migration to the surface.</p>
<p>For geothermal applications, the fracking and rheoreversiblity works at temperatures up to at 400 C.</p>
<p>For all inquiries, please reference Battelle IPID 30392</p>
<p>NOTE:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than thirty (30) days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice, referencing Battelle IPID 30392.</p>

This request is not a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. Responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract. The purpose of this request for information is in support of market research being conducted by the Air Force Metrology Calibration Program (AFMETCAL) to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.) Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged. Currently there are no funds available for this acquisition.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program is considering a purchase of a ADC-2500 Upgrade. This item is an upgrade to the TestVonics ADC-2500 which is a multiple transducer based pressure standard used as a standalone item to calibrate Air Data Test Sets, altimeters, air speed indicators, barometers and similar low pressure TMDE. The ADC-2500 has a Ps range of .3 to 32 in Hg.( -1500 to 100,000 feet), a Qc range of 0 to 74 in. Hg (0 to 1000 Knots), and a Pt range of 0 to 110 in. Hg. The ADC-2500 is capable of generating/controlling pressures with a setability and stability adequate to calibrate a variety of state of the art and older Air Data test Sets. The ADC-2500 is capable of monitoring an externally controlled pressure. The upgrade will ruggedize the ADC-2500 by updating the chassis and incorporate updated components to improve performance and extend the working life of the calibrator. The software will be updated to support the updated components and provide automated calibration support for the TTU205J, the Mensor ADTS405 and the CME ADTS 415F at a minimum.</p>

AMDS technical services personnel are needed to manage and maintain AMDS equipment to carry out day-to-day reporting of F-15 post flight fault data in support of the RSAF flight operations. Most of the contractor's support shall be conducted in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia except for Red/Green Flag training exercise support or other deployments. Other services include producing documents to meet RSAF requirements in the correct format and on time.<br /><br />You will find a copy of the "Request for Information" and "Perfromance Work Statement" attached as Package 1 and Package 2 respectively. &nbsp;<br /><br />Note: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. Companies are encouraged to provide responses to this questionnaire but are advised that their participation is voluntary only. Contractors responding to this Request for Information (RFI) are placed on notice that participation in this survey does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.</p>

<p><br />TITLE: Games for Training (GFT) Next Generation Game (NGG)</p>
<p>NAICS code- 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services and 541512 Computer Systems Design Services.</p>
<p>CLOSING DATE: 14 SEP 17</p>
<p>BRIEF SUMMARY: The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is conducting market research to determine interested sources and technology capabilities of potential offerors for the procurement of Army enterprise gaming training solutions and components.</p>
<p>The Government requests information from industry partners to gain knowledge of their capabilities that will fulfill the requirements for the GFT NGG game-based training simulation.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: PEO STRI, through requirements provided by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capabilities Manager Virtual and Gaming, has a need for a game-based solution to train individual Soldiers at echelons battalion and below in a shared environment, providing military task functionality across key warfighter functions, and with varying levels of immersion. The Government requests information from industry partners to gain knowledge of their capabilities that will fulfill the requirements for the GFT NGG game-based training simulation.</p>
<p>CONTEXT: The US Army, PEO STRI are developing Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) strategies to harness commercial investments (e.g. gaming technology) to facilitate objectives of collective training. While the US Army works towards the mid/long term objectives in the Synthetic Training Environment (STE), it is key that an enhanced gaming capability is fielded to sustain and improve our collective training capability in the near term. The Games for Training (GFT) Next Generation Game (NGG) training capability is a step in this direction to enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon/multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training increasing proficiency through repetition.</p>
<p>The GFT NGG effort will take advantage of emerging commercial gaming technologies. PEO STRI is interested in the potential application of modular gaming framework theories as related to GFT NGG in order to enhance longevity and relevancy of Army TADSS investments. Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to discuss how a modular design may be employed, designation of key interfaces, usability of open standards, and how conformance and performance will be certified.</p>
<p>Example of attributes of modular game framework may include the following:<br />&bull; Image Generation<br />&bull; Artificial Intelligence/<br />&bull; Semi-Automated Forces<br />&bull; Physics<br />&bull; Terrain<br />&bull; Models<br />&bull; Sound Generation<br />&bull; Behaviors<br />&bull; Environmental Effects/Weather<br />&bull; Scenario Generation/<br />&bull; Force Management<br />&bull; Voice/Data Communications<br />&bull; After Action Review<br />&bull; Data Management</p>
<p>Industry should understand that while a modular gaming framework is desired if risk to training readiness is created based on a technical implementation that this attribute may not be implemented.</p>
<p>GFT NGG training capability shall be ready for training NLT 3rd QTR FY19</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED: Relative to GFT NGG objectives the Government requests information regarding the contractor's ability and approach for the following aspects:</p>
<p>1. The Government is aware that there are a limited number of viable game engines that will support the GFT NGG requirement. Describe your proposed game engine and decision criteria for selection of this COTS product. The GFT NGG solution will be required to scale from a single personal computer, for training an individual Soldier, to a network-configured suite that can support a battalion exercise. Discuss potential implementations to meet this requirement. If your company is not the developer of the proposed game engine, describe your management strategy for intellectual property to ensure stable capability to the US Army. For those areas where additional subcontractor support is anticipated or required to augment your company's core capabilities, describe the teaming approach/arrangement that will be utilized to meet the GFT NGG program requirements and limitations for subcontracting. Discuss what data rights / licensing will be provided to the Government as a part of the formal GFT NGG solicitation.</p>
<p>2. It is the Government's intent to leverage existing and developed content (e.g. models, terrain, scenarios, etc.) for all future GFT configurations. Discuss the feasibility of this requirement; include Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) terrain database and moving model reuse, User generated content, commercially available content, as well as GFT NGG prime contractor developed content. GFT NGG will require a capability to compose, save, and export content. Discuss your configuration management approach for the core game, content and the milgaming portal (https://milgaming.army.mil/).<br />3. Discuss the potential inclusion of technology to address the user experience via web-based, console, thin/zero client, or virtual reality. How would the user experience be affected by the technology? Furthermore, discuss any risk associated with these assertions and mitigation strategies. It is the Government's intent to procure a system that will significantly reduce personnel overhead and non-training audience game operators. The GFT NGG system is desired to be simple to setup and operated by users with a non-technical background. Discuss how your approach to GFT NGG will facilitate this objective. The Government may execute GFT program plan where the NGG solution is required to operate on government-furnished hardware. Discuss your risk assessment with this approach and potential mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>4. The Government may desire to harness a cloud base implementation for GFT NGG. Discuss your technical concept (e.g. game provisioning, distributed game engine workload, scalability of players and simulated entities, etc.), concept of operation (day to day operations), and management approach for total concept. Furthermore, provide risk assessment related to performance, information assurance, and network demands. Provide a preliminary risk mitigation assessment for all risks identified.</p>
<p>5. The Government may pursue a Contractor-provided modular game framework and architecture design that harnesses industry standards. Describe your potential implementation of this concept. What specific technology does your company offer to this effort? The response to this question should include concepts as described in the "Context" section of this RFI. The Government desires to understand the feasibility of this approach that may go beyond current capabilities and performance. Beyond what the Government discussed in the "Context", are there other recommendations for potential modular game framework attributes/modules? In particular, discuss what data rights / licensing will be provided to the Government as a part of the Contractor- provided modular game framework and architecture design. Discuss specific APIs that would be part of the modular architecture design and how that design would support Army specific enhancements.</p>
<p>6. There is potential the gaming system will be not only the small echelon collective gaming solution, but also provide an option for future semi-immersive training programs of record to incorporate the modular gaming architecture within their system designs. Describe how you would implement this business model. If the Government chose to use a gaming product line approach to execute this business model, discuss how you would implement the governance and technical aspects of this approach. <br />QUANTITIES: The goal is to have an Army-wide enterprise license for all services, modules, and other system components.</p>
<p>RESPONSES REQUESTED: Contractors should submit all responses to servola.frazier.civ@mail.mil and copy armando.r.hernandez.civ@mail.mil. All responses are due no later than 4:00 PM EST on 14 SEP 17. Early submissions are encouraged. Contractors are requested to provide a relevant white paper addressing the questions above, not exceeding fifteen (15) pages, not including the cover sheet. Font size shall not be smaller than industry standard word processor 12-point Times New Roman. The cover page should include company name, address, and points of contact including phone numbers and email addresses. The notional schedules should define program milestones and initial operating capability (IOC). Please identify your Business Size Standard. If vendor is a small business, provide how you plan on meeting the limitations on subcontracting per FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.</p>
<p>Security Notice to all contractors - During the RFI process PEO STRI Security would like to address early on in the acquisition process to all contractors (prime and subcontractor(s)) that they will be vetted by the government cognizant security authority (CSA) PEO STRI G2. This notification allows all contractors to become aware of some the security requirements listed in the various contract types below that consume a lot of the contractor's time and have to be met. Please see the Security Requirements attachment for further details.</p>
<p>THIS IS AN RFI NOTICE ONLY, and is being used as an instrument to identify potential sources that can provide the capabilities described above. The information provided in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. PEO STRI has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed and the Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All cost associated with this RFI will be solely at the expense of the respondents. Additionally, all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. No basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this RFI.</p>

(2)  Description of the event, including:
(a)  date of occurrence;
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3)  Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;

SPECIFIED REQUIREMENT: Network Contracting Office 7, Charleston, SC is seeking sources for a potential contractor to perform the following type of service: 
STATEMENT OF WORK
VA CDI Pro & VERA Analyzer
WJB Dorn VAMC

INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND:  
a. The Nuance VA CDI Pro Software and VERA Analyzer software will allow for better and broader use of the existing Nuance system within WJB Dorn VAMC. Portions of the implementation package will provide for assessment of current processes, including identification of bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement. CDI consultants will also analyze CDI metrics and provide on-site expert training. VA CDI Pro promotes a clinical and holistic approach to documentation that starts with physician education delivered face to face by Nuance consultant physicians and ends with a complete story of the patient s medical history. The use of VA CDI Pro software results in an immediate opportunity for the hospital to engage in real time, front end improvement of documentation, providing for an accurate patient profile that results in appropriate severity, complexity, risk of morbidity and mortality, and reimbursement for the medical center. 

b. The Nuance VA CDI Pro Software will allow for a compliant documentation management program, in order to improve clinical documentation throughout the facility. A real time clinical approach will be deployed in order to capture the complexity, severity, quality, and present on admission indicators. When the patient is discharged, the medical record will tell the complete clinical story of care. VA CDI pro software will assist in bridging the gap between CDS professionals and coding staff. Obtaining this software will ultimately allow CDI specialists to spend more time performing face to face physician education, engaging in real time feedback, and being a vital part of improving the healthcare record, quality of care, performance measures, and facility reimbursement. 

c. The newly formed Clinical Documentation Improvement Program now consists of two clinical documentation specialists (CDS) that are currently completing manual data entry, tracking, and trending daily. This process consumes approximately 40% of the CDS work day, which results in reduced efficiency of time and takes the CDS away from physician teams at the patient s bedside, real time physician interaction/education, chart reviews, and interaction with coding staff.  CDS daily manual data entry not only takes away from patient care, but is also costing the facility. This manual data entry amounts to facility spending of approximately $937.50 per week per CDI. We now have 2 CDSs on board and are recruiting for two additional CDSs, which will quickly sum to $130,000 per year in facility spending, not including additional time to compile data and create reports, which will all be done automatically in VA CDI Pro

d. Clintegrity VERA Analyzer Software helps target inpatient admissions that may need coding revisions or clinical documentation improvements to ensure a patient is assigned to the appropriate VERA Patient Class and Price Group. Identifying these cases and making coding changes could potentially improve the facility s ability to capture full VERA funding. Four key reports are included with VERA Analyzer:

VERA Audit Detail Report   automates the audit process for 26 inpatient categories reducing time to determine if coding changes should be made or if queries should be sent 
VERA Audit Impact Report - helps to easily determine if coding changes improve VERA funding over time. 
VERA Analyzer Retention Worksheet/Report   monitors retention of patients in VERA Patient Classes and Price Groups to ensure adequate funding from year to year
VERA Patient Listing Report - Contains the current VERA Patient Class and Price Group assigned to the patient in the facility.

On an ongoing, monthly basis, a VA staff member will need to access the ARC to run an import file and update the Clintegrity VERA Analyzer database.  Typically, this is someone from HIMS, Business Office, Vera Coordinator, who will also need access to VERA Analyzer to import this file.

2.  OBJECTIVE:

 a.  Nuance Staff will coordinate with Region 3 COTS to complete installation, pre-implementation, implementation, and post-implementation procedures as outlined in the attached documents provided by Nuance.

b.  Nuance VA CDI Pro and VERA Analyzer are additional licensing agreements to the Nuance Clintegrity software that WJB Dorn VAMC currently uses. Once installation, pre-implementation, and implementation is completed, CDS staff and designated HIMS and VERA Coordinator will be able to utilize the VA CDI Pro and VERA Analyzer tabs in the existing Clintegrity system. The CDS, designated HIMS, and VERA Coordinator are expecting to use VA CDI Pro daily and VERA Analyzer on a regular basis, as a patient record auditing tool, tracking system, and to run various reports, including potential VERA impact, CMI, DRG weights, and VERA reports. It is the expectation that Nuance staff will coordinate with VA staff throughout installation and implementation, will be available by phone for questions, will provide Nuance IT support, and will also complete the post-implementation phase after the product has been in use by VA staff for approximately 6 months. VERA Analyzer training will be completed prior to the VA CDI Pro implementation consisting of two days on site and pre- and post-training consulting with Nuance Consultants. The VA CDI Pro Post-Implementation Support Package will begin after first productive use of the VA CDI Pro system (after Week 1 of Training) and extend one year providing access to learning tools in the JATA CDMP Learning Home Page and support from WJB Dorn VAMC s Nuance CDI Client Support staff member assigned

<SOLNBR>AMD-SS18-08
<RESPDATE>020918
<CONTACT>Forest Crumpler, Phone 3019756753, Email forest.crumpler@nist.gov
<DESC>FAAPS Number: 55180
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a refurbished PlasmaTherm/Unaxis 790 Reactive Ion Etch (RIE) System to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) user facility.  The system will be sited and used as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies in the NIST NanoFab.  The RIE System is a pattern transfer tool that uses chemical plasma to fabricate three-dimensional structures in varied substrate materials. Applications include fabricating nano-semiconductor and nano-photonic devices.</p>
<p>The NanoFab currently operates two PlasmaTherm/Unaxis 790 RIE systems that are heavily used to fabricate a wide variety of devices with different chemical etching gases and substrate materials.  However, the current tools cannot meet the requirements of a growing number of NanoFab users.  More and more materials are being etched. The capacity of the existing RIE systems is becoming a "bottle-neck" for plasma etching in the NanoFab. To increase the NanoFab's capacity to serve users, the NanoFab has a need for another PlasmaTherm/Unaxis 790 RIE system. This additional RIE shall be configured identically to our existing RIEs so processes can be run on any of the three systems with similar results.</p>
<p>General Requirements:<br />&bull;	The system shall be a PlasmaTherm/Unaxis 790 RIE <br />&bull;	The system shall be reconditioned to OEM specifications including new process kit, shower head, base plate, and dark shield.<br />&bull;	The system shall be a complete turnkey system including all vacuum pumps, heat exchangers, RF supplies, etc. only requiring facilities and gas connections to operate.<br />&bull;	The vacuum pump shall be a dry pump.<br />&bull;	The system shall use the PlasmaTherm Cortex control hardware and software system which is required to be compatible with our existing systems.<br />&bull;	The system shall include six gas channels, CHF3, O2, Ar, SF6, CF4, and N2.<br />&bull;	The system shall include an integrated optical emission endpoint system.<br />&bull;	The system shall include full documentation and all system manuals.<br />&bull;	The system shall include a one year warranty.<br />&bull;	The system shall include tool startup and commissioning by a qualified field service engineer.<br />&bull;	Startup must demonstrate key processes of oxide etch, nitride etch, photoresist etch, perform within 5% of the existing systems.</p>
<p><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a vendor that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 1,000 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that can provide the required etch system are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to forest.crumpler@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; <br />(2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and <br />(3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. <br />Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."<br />The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.<br />The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by "bridges". The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics. The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.<br />Scope: Water purification through service deionization. Services include providing all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to set up and install a deionization system that consists of a pre-filter, carbon, cation, anion and/or mixed bed tanks (as necessary), post filter, and any other components such as pressure regulators, water meters, etc. The contractor shall also provide Quality Control, monitoring, and maintenance services throughout the life of the contract.<br />Background: Water filtration is necessary for Steris Reliance Synergy Washers located in Central Hospital Supply (CHS), room B1N254. Local water supply contains an abundance of mineral deposits and sediment such as Calcium, Magnesium, and Sodium, which if left unfiltered can leave trace amounts on instruments being washed. It is also a requirement via the Steris Reliance technical brochure that the source of water being utilized for the washers be pure. Service deionization has proven to be an excellent filtration system in order to eliminate mineral deposits as well as chlorine, chloramines and dissolved organic contaminants.<br />b. The purpose of this market research is to obtain capability statements- Any potential offeror must demonstrate the points referenced in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement.<br />Responses must be submitted to the OPC Contract Specialist referenced below no later than February 9, 2018, at 11:a.m. (eastern). Responses shall be limited to 10 pages.<br /><br /><br /><br />Attn: Gail Akinbinu<br />NIH CC OPC<br />6707 Democracy Blvd Suite 106<br />Bethesda, MD 20892-5480<br />E-mail: gakinbinu@cc.nih.gov<br /><br /><br /><br />

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for February is February 1, 2018 to February 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 201X or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG09 and must be located within Region 9.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>

The project will prepare the site for the replacement of the existing Medical Center currently located on Zorn Avenue. The property will be disposed of once vacated. This disposal effort is not included in this construction contract. The contract duration is anticipated at 439 calendar days.
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>Request responses to the following questions:<br />(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in the&nbsp;Louisville, KY<br />&nbsp;area?<br />(2) Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation.<br />(3) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br />(4) Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.<br />(5) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />(6) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br />(7) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br />(8) Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would affect the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.<br />(9) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br />(10) Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.<br />(11) Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.<br />(12) Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.<br />(13) Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted via email to&nbsp;Josh Gitchel&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Joshua.A.Gitchel@usace.army.mil">Joshua.A.Gitchel@usace.army.mil</a> no later than 1:00 PM EST on 13&nbsp;February 2018.</p>

In such a scenario, the primary offeror or teaming partner shall have completed at least one task order for a comparable service requirement based on scope and relative duration.    
2 -Â  Documented availability of current staff that could provide services at this remote Fort Gibson location.Â  This will be based on the identification of actual staff by name, labor category, employer, and current location of the individual.      
3 - Â Â Identification, make, model, and function, of equipment available to execute requirements.Â  Â 

An identification of relative line item requirements, from a service standpoint, is as follows:

DESCRIPTION:  This is a Sources Sought-Pre-Solicitation Notice for the establishment of an Architect-Engineering (A-E) contract with services to be performed at the Buffalo VA Medical Center, 3495 Bailey Avenue, Buffalo, NY 14215.  This requirement is 100% set-aside to Small Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms.   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330s. The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, scroll down to locate and click on the SF-330 hyperlink entitled,  Architect-Engineer Qualifications.   

VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for complete design services (preliminary concepts and layouts, program development, investigative services, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services) for the Design   Fuel Tank Upgrades, Project# 528-18-110. 

The area of consideration is restricted to firms with offices and key personnel to be assigned to the design located within a 400-mile radius of the Buffalo VAMC site as indicated by a mapquest.com driving directions search from the prime designer s address listed in Vetbiz to the project site. The address of the prime designer will be the main office address listed in Vetbiz, not a satellite office or an office of another company or subcontractor.

Written questions pertaining to this requirement should be submitted no later than 4:00 PM. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), February 26, 2018.  Interested firms should submit their current SF-330, Parts I and II, to Nicholas.Winne@va.gov.  The SF-330s are due no later than 4:00 PM, EDT, March 5, 2018.  

SCOPE OF WORK: 
 The intent of this effort is to remove the existing fuel tanks and replace them with appropriately sized modern tanks and to replace the monitoring/control systems to improve maintainability, meet the backup fuel supply requirements, and meet regulatory compliance requirements. 
The Buffalo VAMC requires a Consultant to perform the Architectural and Engineering (A/E) services necessary to accomplish this goal.

All designs will follow, but not be limited to, VA Space Planning Specifications, in conjunction with the VA Master specifications as outlined in VA Handbook 7610. The design will be completed in a manner such that the estimated construction cost is within the VA budget. 

Buffalo VMAC has five existing tanks that are part of this scope.

All tanks are located outside of Building 6. All systems (security, alarm, control monitoring, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, structural, civil, site work, architectural, fire protection, etc.) related to the boiler plant, the exterior faÃ§ade of Building 6, and the surrounding grounds are within the scope of this effort and subject to renovation. Several exterior doors and windows are immediately next door to the fuel tanks and may need to be relocated and/or replaced.
The existing fuel piping and controls for tanks 1, 2, and 3 (but NOT the tanks themselves) are accessible via an underground tunnel from Building 6. The replacement of this tunnel is also within the scope of this effort.
The legacy boiler control and annunciator board, audible/visual alarms, and abandoned conduits are to be removed and replaced with an Engineering Control Center, boiler plant office space, and energy manager office space. Alarms, indicators, and controls located within the existing annunciator board include: 
Alarms:
Medical gas (Building 1 and Building 20)
Generator run and problems
Air compressor
Sewer overflow
LP gas valve closed
Controls
Emergency Stop LP Gas
Emergency Stop Natural Gas
Plant Master Controller (steam)
Plant feed water controller
Condensate pump #1 and 2 controls
Fuel oil pumps #1 and 2 controls
Heat extractor shutdown bypass switch (fuel oil)
South wall louver control
Boiler plant HVAC controls (including rooftop exhaust fans)
Indicators
Compressed air
City water pressure
Natural gas pressure
Boiler feed water pressure
Fuel oil pressure
Steam header pressure

The main fire alarm panel and emergency backup generator remote annunciator panels are currently located in BLDG 6, RM U-14 and will also be relocated to the Engineering Control Center. Once relocated to the Engineering Control Center, repair/restore RM U-14. Install an ATS for the ECC that uses two different NFPA 70 Article 517 EES equipment branch sources.
Site investigation is required under this scope to identify abandoned conduit and piping. The Engineering Control Center shall be as described in PG-18-9: SPACE PLANNING CRITERIA, CHAPTER 230: ENGINEERING SERVICE. Depending upon the final location of the Engineering Control Center, the existing mezzanine structure may need to be extended and several exterior doors and windows may need to be replaced. Existing active piping and conduits will be relocated to accommodate the new Engineering Control Center. The backup soft water supply line must also be relocated and replaced. The Engineering Control Center, boiler plant, and various mechanical rooms within Building 6 shall be accessed via the facility's existing badge reader system. Existing alarms, indicators, and controls must be maintained during the construction process. The design drawings must show phasing of work to maintain these systems until the new Engineering Control Center is complete.
At one time, there were two additional USTs located outside of Building 6 on the opposite side of the underground tunnel. There is documentation to indicate that these tanks were removed. However there is empirical evidence to suggest that these tanks were actually abandoned in place. Site investigation is required under this scope to verify the status of these tanks. If these tanks are found to have been abandoned in place then they are to be removed under the developed design.
The Buffalo VMAC desires conversion from the existing UST system to a tank system using an Accessible Underground Area. Under this approach, the area above the tanks should be load rated for oversized motor vehicle and bus parking (AASHTO HL93).
Although newer than the fuel oil tanks, the gasoline tank is to be replaced and relocated into the same Accessible Underground Area as the new fuel oil tanks. The associated aboveground pump is to be replaced and relocated as well.
An additional diesel fuel tank will also be added to the same Accessible Underground Area as the new fuel oil tanks. This tank shall have a pump to fuel vehicles.
As-Built and Record Documents
Buffalo VAMC has limited as-built drawings for the existing UST system and associated subsystems.
Although the VA makes every effort to keep drawings current to existing conditions, changes and updates are sometimes not recorded.  It is therefore the Consultants responsibility to perform field investigation and verify of the accuracy of the drawings with the actual conditions.
In fall 2016, Buffalo VAMC hired a Consultant to conduct an analysis of the existing USTs system and document their findings in a report. This report will be provided to the Consultant as source documentation.
Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan
The consultant is responsible for reviewing the work done by any subcontractors that the Consultant has hired to assist with the completion of this SOW. The consultant must provide the Government with a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) Plan that documents the methods, processes, procedures that are going to be implemented by the Consultant to validate the work their subcontractors perform.
Hazardous Materials
Any remaining fuel oil in the existing tanks will need to be removed as part of the construction demolition work. However, the VA does not anticipate any asbestos or lead removal for this project.  There are locations in the VA where asbestos does exist.  Should there be a situation where hazardous materials do need to be removed; the design consultant and the VA will work together during design to plan for construction demolition

OFFERORS WILL BE EVALUATED ON THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
The submitted SF-330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:
This acquisition will be in accordance with FAR Part 36.602-1 and VAAR Part 836.602-1. The following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate SF-330 technical proposals:

The A/E must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria for all services. Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) and (6) are of slightly less importance than (1) through (4), but are equal value among themselves; Criteria (7) and (8) are the least important and listed in descending order of importance.

Submission requirements: Provide up to five (5) projects completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years that best illustrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above. Example projects shall note project s square footage. All projects provided in the SF-330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and/or perform work under this contract. To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF-330 Part 1, Section F Item 25  Firms from Section C Involved in this Project,  block (1). Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21. Include an e-mail address, and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c). Include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above. If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work they provided towards the performance of the overall project. If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract. Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project. Instead, list relevant completed task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being rated lower.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in Part 1, Section F of the SF-330. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluating Criterion 1.

Criterion 2 - Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.

Criterion 3 - Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Firms/teams will be evaluated in terms of their ability to plan for and manage work under the contract and capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.

Submission requirements: Describe the firm s ability to concurrently perform and manage multiple projects in different locations to meet aggressive schedules, multiple disciplines, and control costs and the firm s capacity to accomplish multiple projects simultaneously. 

Criterion 4 - Past Performance   Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.  Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) or CPARS/ACASS for Criterion 1 projects and may include other information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being rated lower. NOTE: Past performance information for projects listed under Criterion 1.

Submission requirements: SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1. IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1.  AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE. IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF-330. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, offerors should complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ (Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s). Offerors may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP (legible copies are acceptable) as long as it is on the same form as posted with this Synopsis.  Offerors should follow up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If requested by the client, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Network Contracting Office 2 Attn: Nicholas Winne via email at Nicholas.Winne@va.gov prior to the response date.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their response PPQs or CPARS previously submitted in response to other A/E services procurements.

Evaluation Scoring

Evaluation factors 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will be evaluated using the following adjectival ratings as follows:

Outstanding: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. 
Good: Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low. 
Acceptable: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate.  
Marginal: Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. 
Unacceptable: Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is not awardable. The firm s proposal demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement and the approach fails to meet performance standards. The firm s proposal has major omissions and inadequate details to assure evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of requirement.

The ratings identified below were used in the evaluation of Past Performance (Criterion 4):

Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.

Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Little doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they could satisfy the requirements of the contract.
Unknown Confidence (Neutral): No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.
Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Some doubt exists based on past performance that they could satisfy the terms and conditions of the contract.
No Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectations that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Significant doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Solutions<br />Joint Standard Instrumentation Suite<br />Missile Attitude Subsystem (JMAS)</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.0 Purpose</strong></p>
<p>This Request for Solutions (RFS) is issued to locate capable vendors with the ability to deliver a unique solution for the Joint Standard Instrumentation Suite Missile Attitude Subsystem (JMAS) requirement presented below. The Government will evaluate the solutions with the intent of awarding an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) in accordance with 10 U.S. Code &sect; 2371b.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Summary and Background </strong></p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) seeks to develop a prototype with enhanced capability to provide 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) attitude data solution (absolute X,Y,Z position, pitch angle, yaw angle, roll) for man portable air defense systems (MANPADS) or track mounted infrared (IR) guided missile while in flight from launch point (0 meters downrange) to a stationary target point against the natural test area background. This solution will also include the corresponding pitch angle and yaw angle of the missile plume.</p>
<p>MANPADS employing infrared seekers are the single biggest threat facing slow-moving, low-flying rotary wing and fixed wing platforms. To counter the prevalent MANPADS and related track mounted IR guided missile threat, the Services are developing autonomous infrared countermeasure (IRCM) systems for installation on several helicopter platforms as well as large aircraft platforms. Advances in ground truth data collection are needed to improve the modeling and simulation of MANPADS and other threats - missile attitude being the most critical need.</p>
<p><strong>The full RFS can be viewed on the Training and Readiness Accelerator (TReX) website, located at the following link:</strong> <a href="https://trainingaccelerator.org/2018/01/jmas-rfs">https://trainingaccelerator.org/2018/01/jmas-rfs</a></p>

<DESC>The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) intends to negotiate and issue a sole source award to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to develop a scoping plan for a scientific assessment of the risks of additive nonpolymetric organohalogen flame retardents (OFRs). The objective of this contract is to acquire a plan for identifying and applying accepted scientific methods for assessing the toxicity of OFRs as a class, to be used by CPSC in its rulemaking efforts, including convening a Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel. CPSC does not have the scientific or technical expertise currently to rule on the risks associated with OFRs. CPSC is authorized to enter into contracts to conduct continuing studies and investigations on the safety of consumer products and on improving the safety of such products (5 U.S. C. &sect; 2054). Currently, the only known source for the required scientific and technical expertise is NAS.<br />&nbsp;
<p>NAS is unique in its capabilities to supply services for establishing balanced committees of the nation's most distinguished scientists recognized as top national and international scientific experts. These scientific experts volunteer their services to address society's most complex and pressing scientific issues, where significant extrapolation is required to use existing data and methods to address data gaps. The resulting consensus reports are accepted nationally and internationally as comprehensive, high quality scientific technical scientific consensus reports, which can be relied on as independent, objective, and nonpartisan advice for use by regulatory agencies in support of risk management decisions.</p>
<p>CPSC intends to negotiate this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)1. The sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Subpart 12 &amp; FAR Subpart 13 procedures. Interested persons may identify their interest and submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within ten (10) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any quotation/response must be in writing and can be sent via email to the Contract Specialist at csterba@cpsc.gov by 2pm Eastern Time February 9, 2018. No phone calls will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Associate Under Secretary for Environment, Health, Safety and Security intends to issue a one year base contract with four single year option periods for a total of five years on a sole source basis with â€œNC4â€ located in El Segundo, California.  The DOE is seeking to contract with NC4 to provide the DOE with access to the Foreign Access and Central Tracking System (FACTS).  The DOE requires the FACTS service to be accessible to 75 DOE facilities including Headquarters.  FACTS is a service that documents and tracks access control records of international visits, assignments, and employment at DOE facilities and contractor sites. 
Specifically, the system was developed, and implemented in June 2000, in response to a U.S. Department of Energy Program, which required the Department to develop procedures and practices, through the newly established Office of Foreign Visits and Assignments, to meet the needs of DOE's vital programs while providing protection from foreign threats, and specifically required DOE to provide Department-wide tracking of foreign national access to DOE facilities. 
In addition to providing FACTS, NC4 will provide help desk support for FACTS Monday through Friday. NC4 will also provide up to four training sessions per year in the Washington DC area at the DOEâ€™s request.
In accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act, 41 U.S.C 253 [C] [1], as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.  
THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.
Interested parties may submit a capability statement by February 16, 2018, at 11:59 PM EST via email to Michael.Thomey@hq.doe.gov.  Please include â€œFACTSâ€ in the subject line of the email if submitting a capability statement.  The written response must include a detailed discussion demonstrating experience providing the services identified in this announcement and past performance client information for similar services.
A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC><br /><strong>Synopsis: </strong><br /><br />NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong><br /><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong><br /><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a coating material made of a novel copolyimide containing surface modifying agents that is designed to prevent the accumulation of insect residue on aircraft wings and reduce surface imperfections on other low friction or non-stick surfaces. Roughening residues have the potential to significantly disrupt laminar air flow over the wings and eliminating them can reduce air resistance and improve fuel economy. Accumulation of undesirable species such as insect residue is mitigated by use of copolyimide coatings incorporating fluorine and silicon surface modifying agents (SMAs) in a novel chemical formulation. The coating minimizes adhesion while at the same time maintaining the bulk properties of the polyimide coating. The specific SMAs used here are designed to be thermodynamically drawn to the coating surface. Further, the SMAs react chemically with the polymer backbone and are thus chemically bonded, so the SMAs will not evaporate or migrate out of the coating material. The coating adheres well to a range of relevant materials, including aluminum, composites and plastics and reduces surface imperfections on other low friction or non-stick surfaces. The active surface modifying agents in the coating migrate to the air surface, but do not evaporate or otherwise need replacement. Potential use to keep other surfaces clean of insect residue, such as automobiles and wind turbines.  NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.<br /><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company.  Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA Langley-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Langley's Technology Gateway at https://technologygateway.nasa.gov/<br /><br />These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley's Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development "OSACB" for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice. </strong><br />

<DESC>The Contracting Department, NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC), Norfolk, VA, negotiated a contract with firm fixed price provisions under FAR Part 12 â€œAcquisition of Commercial Itemsâ€ and FAR Part 15 â€œContracting by Negotiationâ€. 

In preparation for contingency operations that EOD Group Commanders support, the requirement for a one-stop training and sustainment for an enduring Parachute Proficiency Training (PPT) support service must be acquired. The PPT Course of Instruction (COI) is a consolidated training and sustainment package allowing advanced EOD Forces the ability to train and sustain a Military High Altitude Low Opening/High Altitude High Opening (HALO/HAHO) free fall capability on a scheduled basis during their Fleet Response Training Plan (FRTP).
 Platoon specific rotation cycles are set up to accommodate this Pre-Mission Training (PMT) prior to their Final Evaluation Phase (FEP). The PPT program is intended to sustain HALO/HAHO proficiency prior to integration with Special Operations Units.  Advanced EOD Platoons are brought to a level in which they have the ability to safely integrate into Special Forces PMT like the Arch Angel Program conducted in Eloy, AZ.  In summary, this PPT is a qualification and sustainment training required for all EOD personnel in order to stay within the minimum required parachute proficiency and qualification in preparation for deployment as part of their Unit Level Training (ULTRA) and based on the FRTP.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 611620, with a size Standard of $7.5M.
 The prospective Request for Proposal (RFP) was processed as a Small Business Set-Aside.

The resulting contract was awarded to:

Contract Number: N00189-18-C-0014 in the amount of $7,707,600.00, Airborne Support Group, 4900 N Taylor Street, Elroy, AZ 85131-9759 

The award was made for a twelve (12) month base period and four (4) twelve month option periods. Please direct all questions regarding this requirement via e-mail to the POC identified in this synopsis.

<DESC>SOLICITATION F3QCCM8004A001 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ)
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. F3QCMM8004A001.</p>
<p>This solicitation will be solicited sole source to Great River Technology. This will be a firm-fixed price award.</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD<br />(a) NAICS: 334111<br />(b) No. of Employees: 1,250 Employees<br />(c) Dollars: N/A</p>
<p>OEM: Great River Technology<br />4910 Alameda Blvd NE<br />Albuquerque, NM 87113-1472<br />CAGE Code: 1VHV8<br />Business Size: Small Business (NAICS Code: 334111)</p>
<p>Justification for Sole Source Only:<br />The MC130J SOF EISE lab simulates US Air Force Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) to develop operational flight programs. The lab equipment must exactly match the fielded aircraft parts, which were manufactured by Great River Technology,Inc. (GRT). While the ARINC 818 protocol is not proprietary, due to the specific configuration and limited install base, only GRT provides a 100-percent-compatible solution. GRT manufactures all of the 818 processors and protocols used by the MC-130J Special Mission Processors (SMPs), MC-130J Video Display Terminals (VDTs), AC-130J Precision Strike Package (PSP) high definition display monitors, and the AC-130J SMPs. The 580th SMXS is the Software Maintenance Depot for the MC-130J and AC-130J SMPs, and as such must support the communication protocols with the highest degree of accuracy.<br />No alternatives could stimulate and receive the SMP 818 communication bus sufficiently to pass an airworthiness Formal Qualification Test (FQT) of the Operational Flight Program (OFP) to allow for official airborne flight-test. Only the GRT equipment sought will maintain configuration control with the lab's existing test equipment and with the fielded equipment the lab supports.</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>Purchase of ARINC 818 test equipment manufactured to include all necessary hardware and attachments IAW attached Purchase Description.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Ensure that tank car, tank truck, and vessel loading/unloading procedures meet the minimum requirements and regulations established by the Department of Transportation and the State of Virginia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Delivery personnel are required to adhere to the following procedures:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">C.1.1 Prior to Product Transfer </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">1. All ASTs shall be equipped with a level gauge that is readily visible at the fill port and indicates the level of oil or quantity of oil in the tank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the storage capacity, product stored and tank identification number shall be clearly marked on the tank. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">2. If no spill containment structures are present, park truck as close as possible to the tank to load or unload oil. Use the minimum length of transfer hose possible to complete the connection between the truck and tank. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">3. Inspect tanker vehicle drains, valves and outlets for evidence of leakage. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">4. The driver must supply and implement active measures such as drip pans or absorbent pads during each transfer to minimize minor dripping and incidental fuel spillage, especially for hose disconnections and hose retrieval. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">5. Check to make sure that the loading/unloading truck and transfer lines are located within a containment system or on a sloped pavement that will drain to a containment system, if available. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">6. Visually check all transfer hoses for signs of leakage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If dripping, weeping or leakage is discovered, the driver must implement active measures to minimize incidental spillage (see Step 3 above). </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">7. Establish adequate bonding/grounding of the tanker truck before connecting to the fuel transfer point. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">8. Keep transfer hose ends tightly capped while moving hoses into position. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">C.1.2 During Product Transfer </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">1. The driver shall ensure the transfer operation is monitored continually, either by manual or automatic means, until complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">2. The driver will not leave the vehicle unattended during the loading/unloading process. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">3. When transferring Class 1 (flammable) liquids, shut off motors of auxiliary or portable pumps when making and breaking hose connections. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">4. Ensure that a direct line of communication between the gauge reader and the pump operator is maintained at all times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For one man fueling operations, visual observation of the level gauge during transfer is sufficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">5. Monitor all transfer hose couplings for leakage. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">6. Monitor the liquid level in the receiving tank to prevent overflow by level gauge or visual observation of the free surface of oil in the container. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">7. Reduce flow rate while topping off the tank to provide sufficient reaction time for pump shutdown without overflow of the receiving tank.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">8. Never completely fill the receiving tank when loading; provide sufficient head space to prevent overflow due to thermal expansion. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">C.1.3 Following Completion of Product Transfer </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">2. Close all tank and loading valves before disconnecting. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">3. Make sure that all product transfer operations are complete before disconnecting any transfer lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">4. Ensure that transfer hoses or other connecting devices are drained, vented, blown down, or blown out with inert gas to remove the remaining product prior to moving them away from their connections. 5. Ensure that active measures (drip pans, absorbent pads, spill equipment) are in place before breaking a connection to prevent minor spills. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">6. Cap the end of the transfer hose or other connecting devices before moving them to prevent uncontrolled oil leakage. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">7. Inspect tanker truck drains, valves and outlets for evidence of leakage. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">8. Disconnect grounding/bonding wires. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">9. Cap associated transfer hose risers. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">10. Close all transfer hose riser valves not in use. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">11. Remove any wheel chocks that have been used. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">12. Properly dispose of any contaminated equipment used to control incidental spillage and fuel collected in drip pans during transfer operations.</span></p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, â€œdoing business asâ€ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

(End of clause)<BR><BR>(a)U.S. and Coalition Commanders possess inherent authority to maintain law and order, provide security, and impose discipline necessary to protect the inhabitants of U.S. and/or Coalition installations, U.S. and Coalition personnel operating outside of installations, and U.S. or Coalition-funded developmental projects in Afghanistan. This authority allows commanders to administratively and physically control access to installations and/or project sites, and to bar contracts â€“ including prime contractors, subcontractors at any tier, and any employees, from an installation or site. A commanderâ€™s inherent force protection (FP) authority is independent of an agencyâ€™s contracting authority, and it may not be superseded by any contractual term or provision. (b)The prime Contractor/Vendor acknowledges that: submission of a bid, offer, or a proposal; acceptance of contract award of any type; or continuing effort under any contract that includes this clause; requires that the prime Contractor/Vendor, and all subcontractors under any affected contracts be initially eligible â€“ and remain eligible during the entire period of contract performance to include any warrant period â€“ for installation access to a U.S. and/or Coalition installation, regardless of whether the performance will take place on or off a U.S. or Coalition installation.<BR><BR>(c)To be eligible for installation access, Contractors and subcontractors at all tiers are required to register for installation access in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) and are responsible for keeping the information in the this system updated at all times. Prime Contractors and subcontractors at any tier may verify their registration at https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/ by selecting the â€œVendors Loginâ€ module and logging in with their user name and password. The offeror must be registered, approved, and eligible for installation access prior to award, and remain eligible for installation access for the life of the contract. (1)The offeror is required to submit a listing of all proposed subcontractors , at all tiers, to the contracting officer with the submission of the proposal, and provide updates during the life of the contract when subcontractors are added or removed. If no subcontractors are expected to perform during the life of the contract, the offeror must submit a negative response to the Contracting Officer with its proposal. After award, the prime contractor must submit a negative response to the contracting officer at the beginning of each performance period. (2)Failure to be approved in JCCS â€“ and thereby be eligible for installation access at the Prime and subcontractor levels â€“ or failure to inform the contracting officer of the names of all prospective subcontractors (or provide a negative reply), may render the offerors/contractor ineligible for award or continued performance. Additionally, any firm that is declared ineligible for installation access will be deemed non-responsible until such time as that firm is again deemed eligible by the appropriate access approval authority. (d)Installation access determinations arise from the Combatant Commanderâ€™s inherent authority and are separate and distinct from any law, regulation, or policy regarding suspension and debarment authority. Contractor queries or requests for reconsideration related to U.S. or Coalition installation base access eligibility must be directed to the authority responsible for base access decisions. (End of Clause)<BR><BR>(a)Pursuant to the authority of USCENTCOM FRAGOâ€™s 09-1567 and 10-143 this contract is awarded in Afghani (local currency), if awarded to a host nation vendor. The contractor will receive payment in local currency via Electronic Funds Transfer to a local (Afghan) banking institution. (b)By exception, the following forms of payment are acceptable when EFT using ITS.gov is determined not available by the local finance office, in order of priority. (1) EFT using Limited Depository Account (LDA) (2) Check from the local finance office LDA (3)Local currency cash payments (must be approved in writing by the local finance office and contracting office prior to contract/purchase order award). Payments in cash are restricted to contracts/purchase orders when the vendor provides proof via a letter from the host nation banking institution that it is not EFT capable and validated by the local finance office that the vendorâ€™s banking institution is not EFT capable. Cash payments will be made in Afghani. (End of Clause)<BR><BR>(a)This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld. If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) in accordance with FAR 33.103. A protest to ECC-A is a â€œPROTEST TO THE AGENCY,â€ within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The ECC-A Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ECC-A, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed. (b)An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the ECC-A Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by ECC-A. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following: (1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services. (2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request. (3) An award or proposed award of the contract.<BR><BR>(4)A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract. (c)An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (f) of this provision for resolution of protests. (d)For the purpose of filing a ECC-A Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. (e)An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the Contracting Officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer. (f) ECC-A Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer Ms. Claudetta Smith; claudetta.n.smith.civ@mail.mil. (End of Clause)<BR><BR>a. Movement and coordination of inbound and outbound cargo in Afghanistan is critical to ensuring an effective drawdown. The contractor shall provide visibility of their inbound cargo and equipment via the Synchronized Pre-deployment Operational Tracker (SPOT) census for their contract. This requirement includes the primes, and subcontractorâ€™s at all tiers, cargo and equipment. The contractor shall report any individual piece of equipment valued at $50,000 or more. Incoming cargo and equipment census data shall be input 30 days prior to start of performance or delivery of supplies and quarterly thereafter for inbound and outbound equipment. b. This reporting is required on Rolling Stock (RS), Non Rolling Stock (RNRS), and Twenty foot Equivalent Units (TEU). The following definitions apply to these equipment/cargo categories: (1)Rolling Stock (RS): All equipment with wheels or tracks that is self-propelled, or is un-powered and can be towed by a vehicle on a roadway. Also includes standard trailer mounted equipment such as generators, water purification equipment, and other support equipment with permanent wheels. Specific examples of RS include Wheeled Armored Vehicles (WAVS), Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected (MRAP) family of vehicles (FOVS), and Highly Mobile Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVS).<BR><BR>(2)Non Rolling Stock (RNRS): All equipment that is not classified as Rolling Stock. Includes equipment that is not trailer-mounted or originally designed to be driven or towed over a roadway. (3)Twenty foot Equivalent Units (TEU): Standard unit for describing a shipâ€™s cargo capacity, or a shipping terminalâ€™s cargo handling capacity. One TEU represents the cargo capacity of a standard intermodal shipping container, 20 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 8.5 feet high. One TEU is equivalent to 4 QUADCONS and 3 TRICONS. One TEU has an internal volume of 1,166 cubic feet. c. This data will be used by United States Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) to assist in tracking the drawdown of Afghanistan. The contractor is responsible for movement of their own cargo and equipment. The data provided by contractors is for informational purposes only in order to plan and coordinate the drawdown effort. The Government assumes no responsibility for contractor demobilization except as stated in individual contract terms and conditions. (End of Clause))<BR><BR>a) The Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable. A quote is technically acceptable if it meets the solicitation requirements. If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated. The government intends to make an award without holding discussions; however, the government reserves the right to hold discussion if necessary. Past performance is not an evaluation factor, but shall be used in determining contractor responsibility IAW FAR 9.104.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.209-10, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015).

Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:
(1) The schedule of supplies/services.
(2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause;
(3) The clause at 52.212-5.
(4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
(5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.
(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governmentâ€™s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, â€œdoing business asâ€ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business dayâ€™s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of Paymentâ€ paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractorâ€™s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of paymentâ€ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an â€œI agreeâ€ click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., â€œclick-wrapâ€ or â€œbrowse-wrapâ€ agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractorâ€™s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:
(1) 52.203-19, Prohibition on Requiring Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statements (Jan 2017) (section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations (Jun 2013)

(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an â€œI agreeâ€ click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., â€œclick-wrapâ€ or â€œbrowse-wrapâ€ agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(c) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts with small business concerns, including subcontracts with small business concerns for the acquisition of commercial items.<BR><BR>a) This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C chapter 71, Contract Disputes.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
(ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractorâ€™s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of paymentâ€ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>Title: Co-crystal structure of LATS2 Kinase with kinase inhibitor AT-7867
<p>(i)	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii)	The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-CSS-2018-90 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>(iii)	The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-96, dated 11/06/2017.</p>
<p>(iv)	The associated NAICS code 541380 and the small business size standard $15.0M per year.  This requirement is competed using full and open procedures with no set-aside restrictions.</p>
<p>(v)	<strong>Background:</strong> The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center that prides itself on its tremendously productive pipeline and is innovative in a number of ways. NCATS brings together a diverse range of scientists, including medicinal chemists, biologists, toxicologists, and engineers, in order to ultimately translate basic science into real products and services that help improve people's lives. Included in this process is the development of unique small molecules as potential anticancer agents.<br /><br /> The repurposing of known drugs for use against novel targets is a validated method for accelerating translational drug discovery.  NCATS has an ongoing program aimed at the repurposing of such drugs, specifically including kinase inhibitors, which typically inhibit not only the original kinase target, but also other kinases of interest.  We have tested a collection of known kinase inhibitor drugs against a broad panel of kinases, and from that determined that the known inhibitor AT-7867 potently inhibits LATS2, an emerging kinase of great interest in the biomedical community.</p>
<p>Data from recent publications highlight an important role for LATS2 in tumor suppression as part of the Hippo signaling pathway.  Potent and selective inhibitors of LATS2 have not yet been reported in the literature and would be highly useful as tools for further elucidating the role of LATS2, and as starting points for LATS2 inhibitor drugs.</p>
<p>The determination of an X-ray co-crystal structure of LATS2 kinase bound to AT-7867 will facilitate the rapid repurposing of AT-7867 and analogs thereof as inhibitors of the novel kinase LATS2. These would be useful both as tools for further elucidating the important biology associated with LATS2, and as potential starting points for developing LATS2 inhibitor drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: </strong>The purpose of this requirement is to determine an X-ray co-crystal structure of LATS2 kinase with a known potent inhibitor of LATS2 (AT-7867).  This determination will provide a starting point for the potential repurposing of AT-7867 and subsequent analogs as inhibitors of this novel kinase.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong> Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor will:<br />a)	Conduct gene template synthesis necessary to support the production of LATS2 protein constructs.</p>
<p>b)	Produce up to 15 LATS2 protein constructs of varying length in E. coli and baculovirus expression systems.</p>
<p>c)	Conduct pilot expression and purification studies to evaluate the potential of each construct.</p>
<p>d)	Scale up the expression and purification of the most promising 1 - 3 constructs in E. coli and baculovirus.</p>
<p>e)	Conduct co-crystallization experiments using LATS2 kinase and the known small molecule inhibitor AT-7867.</p>
<p>f)	Obtain an X-ray co-crystal structure of LATS2 kinase and AT-7867 with resolution &lt;3.0 angstroms.</p>
<p>g)	Provide a comprehensive data report including the structure and all relevant data parameters.</p>
<p>(vi)	The period of performance is 40 weeks after receipt of award.</p>
<p>(vii)	The provision at FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(viii)	The provision at FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1)	Technical Capability.  The Government will evaluate:</p>
<p>&bull;	Experience in the production of proteion constructs protein constructs using E. coli and baculovirus expression systems, including SF9, SF21 and High V cells.</p>
<p>&bull;	Protein production capacity in E. coli (&gt;200 L / week) and in baculovirus systems (&gt;50 L / week).</p>
<p>&bull;	Experience in the determination of X-ray co-crystal structures of proteins with small molecule inhibitors.</p>
<p>&bull;	Access to all critical instrumentation necessary to accomplish the project requirements, including access to a high-quality synchrotron such as the Chicago Advanced Photon Source (APS) or the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF).</p>
<p>2)	Price</p>
<p>Technical capability is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>b)	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(ix)	The Offerors to include a completed copy of the provision at FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.</p>
<p>(x)	The FAR clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xi)	FAR clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii)	The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) are not applicable to this requirement.</p>
<p>(xiii)	Responses to this solicitation must include clear and convincing evidence of the offeror's capability of fulfilling the requirement as it relates to the technical evaluation criteria.  The price proposal must include the labor categories, an estimate of the number of hours required for each labor category, fully loaded fixed hourly rate or each labor category, breakdown and rationale for other direct costs or materials, and the total amount.</p>
<p>In addition the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size must be included in the response. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov."</p>
<p>All responses must be received by 12:00 PM Eastern, Thursday, February 8, 2018 and reference number HHS-NIH-NIDA-CSS-2018-90.   Responses may be submitted electronically to Jeffrey Schmidt, schmidtjr@mail.nih.gov.</p>
<p>Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance will be six months from the date of award. <br />52.204-13 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT MAINTENANCE (JUL 2013)<br />(a) Definitions.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.<br />"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;<br />(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;<br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(c) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.<br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted<br />(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or<br />(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(End of clause)<br />52.232-39 UNENFORCEABILITY OF UNAUTHORIZED OBLIGATIONS (JUN 2013)<br />(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: <br />(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />52.232-40 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEC 2013)<br />(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.<br />(b) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<br />(b) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts with small business concerns, including subcontracts with small business concerns for the acquisition of commercial items.<br />52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)</p>

Identify constraints in transparency <br />(b) The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her.

<p>This requirement is not eligible for small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), intends to procure on a sole source basis to Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), 6220 Culebra Rd, San Antonio TX 78238-5166, a quantity of two (2) V/UHF Scout Kits systems to include two (2) NDR814 (8 RF input) 8-channel Wideband Tuners, two (2) interconnect documents, two (2) Factory Acceptance Procedure documents, two (2) Software Installation disks, and two (2) Integration and training sessions as noted in the attached Standard Form 1449 - Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commerical Items, the Statement of Work, Contracts Data Requirements List (CDRL) A001 and A002, Data Item Description (DID) Number: DI-PSSS-82161 and DID Number: DI-MISC-81943 documents.&nbsp;The SwRI Acquisition System is an integral part of Shipboard Systems and is required by Combat Direction Systems Activity (CDSA) to support current Fleet requirements.
