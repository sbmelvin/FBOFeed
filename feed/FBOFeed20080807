<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Getinge, USA, Inc., 1777 E. Henrietta Rd 14623-3133 as the only responsible source that can provide BLUEMMSA Surgical Ceiling Lights that is approved for use in mobile ISO shelter structures used in Navy Field medicine.  Getinge Surgical lights will be used in deployed medical temporary structures in Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM). 

Qty: 8 units each with Optional 8 units each.

In compliance with the Ships OPNAVINST 4790.4D, the Defense Medical Standardization Board (DMSB), Deployable Medical System (DEPMEDS) program and the Commands initiative to enhance Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) for shipboard applications, the only technically acceptable item which has (ILS) support is the BLUEMMSA operating room surgical lights manufactured by Getinge USA, Inc.  

The following are essential characteristics of the Getinge BLUEMMSA light: 

1.  Shall be a ceiling mounted surgical light; shall be a dual light head operating room light that has a minimum luminance of 80,000 Lux per light head.

2.  The suspension arm shall rotate 360 degree in the tight constraints of the ISO shelter structure and allow for maximum head clearance in the low 7 feet 0 inches ceiling heights. The lights shall not use gas piston arm supports to hold light in position.     The light shall hang down no more than 12 inches, with the lowest point of the suspension no more than 6 feet 0 inches. 

3.  The mount plate shall be specially designed and fabricated to allow the surgical shelter light to attach to the existing mounts in the ISO shelter ceiling. 

4.  The Power supply is specially designed for redundancy in the field with two transformers.  The transformers shall be housed in a Nema enclosure that quickly mounts with quick disconnects for incoming power and low voltage output to the light.  The Power Supply shall be designed to be quickly dismantled and packed away during ISO shelter transport.  The power supply will have 110VAC to 120 VAC 60 Hz single phase incoming power and output power shall range from 24.5 VAC to 27.5 VAC. The power supply and mounting plate of the Getinge BLUEMMSA Light is specially designed to quickly connect to the existing equipment integral to the ISO shelter.

5.  The light kit shall provide all necessary wiring cables and conduits to allow a quick change from the existing operating room lights to the new lights in the field. The installation manual must be specially written to detail the step by step replacement.

6.  Any specialized installation tools necessary for the installation shall be included in the kit.

7.  The light heads and power supply shall be protected within a MIL specified case.  The light heads and transformer can be quickly disconnected and secured in the case.  The kit tools shall also be stored in the case.

11.  The operating room light shall utilize an easy access on/off switch and easy bulb assembly replacement.

12.  The operating room light shall use a removable sterilizable handle to manipulate the light during surgery.

The complete kit for the quick installation dual light system, Getinge BLUEMMSA, is specifically designed for Department of Defense ISO shelters and has been approved by the DMSB (Defense Medical Standardization Board) for the following reasons:

1.  Main Arms Changes:  The upper arm was reduced to the shortest standard arm (Typically the upper would be the longest).  The Lower of the two main light arms were shortened to 27.5 inches and curved upward.  These enhancements allowed the suspension to rotate 360 degree in the tight constraints of the ISO shelter structure and allowed the lights to have maximum head clearance in the low ceiling heights.  The spring arm post was also shortened by 3 inches to help head clearance.  The lowest point of the suspension is 6 feet 0 inches. 
2.  Ceiling Mount Plate Change:  The mount plate was specially designed and fabricated to allow the BLUEMMSA light to attach to the existing mounts in the ISO shelter ceiling. The plate design maximizes light clearance. 
3.  Power Supply Change:  The Power supply was specially designed for redundancy in the field with two transformers.  They are both housed in a Nema enclosure that quickly mounts with quick disconnects for incoming power and low voltage output to the light.     The Power Supply is designed to be quickly dismantled and packed away during ISO shelter transport. 
4.  Wiring conduits and connections:  The light kit provides all necessary wiring cables and conduits to allow a quick change from the existing lights to the new lights in the field.  The installation manual is specially written to detail the step by step replacement. 
5.  Tools:  Specialized installation tools are included in the kit necessary for the installation. 
6.  Hardigg Case enclosure:  The light heads and power supply are protected within a MIL specified case by Hardigg while in transport. The light heads and transformer can be quickly disconnected and secured in the case within a few minutes. The kit tools are also stored in the case. 

Based on the above information, it has been determined that the only technically acceptable surgical light is manufactured by Getinge USA.

<DESC>The Federal Correctional Institution, Edgefield, South Carolina, is soliciting quotations for a service contract for the provision of (24) copy machines along with a maintenance agreement for these copiers.  Your pricing should be based on several of our areas making a minimal number of copies.  The contract time period will include a base year not to exceed (12) months with the possibility of four one-year option periods.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract with an estimated award date of October 1, 2008.

We are soliciting for (24) copy machines on a leasing agreement.  Please provide us with a flat rate of a cost per copy for the maintenance agreement for each machine.  This costs should also include any leasing costs we will be required to pay.  Also, please confirm the agreement will include all repairs, supplies, such as toner, etc. and what other items are included.  The standard contract is inclusive with the exception of staples and paper.  Please confirm this in your bid.

If there is an allowance of copies per month, please provide us with this figure.  If this figure is reached for all (24) copiers per month, please provide the overage cost per copy even if it is the same amount of the original cost per copy.

If your company does receive the award of the contract, you will receive a listing of each location with a contact name and extension number in order for meter readings to be obtained.

Along with your bid on the actual copier maintenance and cost per copy, we are requesting the copy machines that you provide be a digital type machine with some of the following features, at a minimum: stapling, sorting, duplexing, automatic feed on top, reduction/enlarging, auto tray switching, book copy, photo mode, etc.  We understand there will be different model numbers being provided but we are requesting these features, at a minimum.  We need the copier for each area to meet the needs of that area as far as copying requirements go.  This can be based on the history of meter reads for each area which will be included in the solicitation package.	

As for repair calls, there will be a requirement of a (48) hour turn around after the repair call has been made.  THERE IS ALSO A REQUIREMENT OF TWO (2) TECHNICIANS, AT A MINIMUM, TO REPAIR MACHINES; THEREFORE, NO DOWN TIME SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED WHEN PLACING REPAIR CALLS.  The names of the technicians must be provided at the time of the submission of your bid.  Only one (1) repairman is needed per repair.  If there are several machines down at one time, we would want two technicians on site making repairs if it was going to result in the repairs crossing over into a few days.  

We will not be taking advantage of the networking system that so many companies offer.  There are too many hindrances with our agency that restrict us from taking advantage of this feature.  This should not be included in your price.

An invoice must be received from the company who receives the award each month identifying the costs for the prior months services.

Please be advised, on a security note, if your company receives the award of the copier maintenance contract, the technicians you provide to perform the maintenance, or any other representative from your company, will not have any communications or any contact with our inmate population at the Federal Correctional Institution or the minimum security Satellite Prison Camp.  If it is reported that communications have been taking place with the inmate population, based on the circumstances and the severity of the breech of security, dismissal will be warranted and the contract will be immediately terminated.  Please be aware of this!

<SUBJECT>Privatize the Improved Development and Production of Gypchek, a Viral Insecticide

<RESPDATE>090908
<CONTACT>Patricia M Pierce, Contracting Officer, Phone 610-557-4248, Fax 610-557-4224, Email ppierce@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The USDA Forest Service intends to issue a negotiated Request for Quotation (RFQ) and receive proposals from interested offerors to improve or advance the development and production of Gypchek, a viral insecticide.  Proposals that either enhance performance or significantly reduce cost or any other new technologies are of particular interest.

Currently Gypchek is registered with the US-EPA by the Forest Service to control gypsy moth.  This production will be based on the current published protocols for producing Gypchek as developed by the Forest Service (H.D.Burges 1988 Formulation of Microbial Pesticides. Pg 39  Kluwer Academic Publishers London  ISBN 0412625202) although improvements in this production technology are desired.  Table 3.3 Production of a technical powder (Gypchek) of gypsy moth nuclear polyhedrosis virus (LdMNPV) from in vivo culture in larvae will be included in the RFQ.

For more than 20 years, the USDA Forest Service has attempted to interest private industry in the production of Gypchek.  There have been several attempts to privatize but for various reasons none were productive.  Gypchek has been used as an important niche product in the U.S. gypsy moth cooperative suppression program for treatment of sensitive areas where other control applications would have unacceptable non-target consequences.  Gypchek demand from 2000-2007 was 31,000 acres or about 3900 acres/year. 

The current Forest Service/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service production is the only process available producing Gypchek in the U.S.  The Forest Service wishes to transfer this technology to the private sector for continued development toward maximizing production and for long term availability of Gypchek or a comparable viral product for use in government sponsored programs.

The RFQ will be issued on August 21, 2008 and proposals will be due September 9, 2008.  

This project is full and open competition, unrestricted, no set-asides.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology (LICB) plans to procure the brand name Cytek upgrade of Facs Calibur Flow Cytometer to 8-color digital Acquisition Capability with Cytek Development; 4059 Clipper Court, Fremont, CA 94538.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Part I: Background information and description of requirements:</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology (LICB) investigates cellular signal transduction and gene expression mechanisms in cells of the immune systems, and how they are implicated in immune cell development and function. The goal of these studies is to define cellular activation pathways, to identify mechanisms that control the development and function of immune cells in the perspective of the NCI mission of providing diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures against cancer.</p>
<p>The LICB wishes to improve the performance of its FacsCalibur flow cytometer in two main respects. First, improve detection capability by upgrading from 2 laser 5 color to 3 lasers and 8 colors. The objective is to allow for the simultaneous measurement of a greater number of parameters on each cell submitted to analysis and thereby to gain a better understanding of cell responses to stimuli and of differentiation events during cell development. Second, improve analysis speed by upgrading from analog to digital electronic acquisition devices. The objective is to increase the numbers of cells that can be analyzed in a given time which will both result in greater productivity and allow the analyses of rare populations or subset that are out of reach from current equipment.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p>Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition:</p>
<p>Statutory Authority: 13.106-1 (b)</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification:</p>
<p>The digital electronic upgrade must include 18bit digital electronics. The acquisition software must be Flowjo Collector edition and run on a personal computer (either Apple or Windows-based). Specifically, the software must produce standard flow cytometry format files (.fcs), include full digital compensation and allow the display of compensated data during acquisition. It must include independent voltage setting for each photodetector. It must allow data collection and storage with or without compensation at the user's discretion. The LICB requires the components of this order to provide data under the form of digital files that can be analyzed by appropriate software reading .fcs files. Cytek is the only source known to the NCI that can provide, install and maintain flow cytometer upgrades.</p>
<p>The following salient characteristics apply:</p>
<p>The system must keep (or replace to similar or better performance) the current 488 nm and 637 nm excitation lasers, photodetectors and filters (530/30and 585/42 on 488 nm laser, and 666/27 and 740 LP on 637 nm laser).</p>
<p>The upgrade must include a violet laser (407 nm excitation) and 440/50 and 545/30 nm filters for reading of blue (e.g. Pacific Blue, CFP, VIVID) or orange (e.g. Pacific orange) fluorescent emitted light.</p>
<p>The current 688 nm LP filter on light emitted from the 488 nm laser must be replaced by a set of two new filters (680/30nm and 740 LP) to allow the detection of two red emitted lights (e.g. PE-Cy5 and PE-Cy7, respectively).</p>
<p>The violet laser, new filters and photo detectors must fit within the space available in the Facscalibur architecture.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a request for solicitation or a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: if the party can meet the unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to solicit proposals for sources to provide repository services for pediatric pre-clinical and clinical trial activities being conducted under the authority of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541711.    It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about September 30, 2008.   

The services being sought by this notice are related to the establishment and operation of a large repository to receive, store, process, and ship biological, chemical and drug formulation samples that will be collected throughout multiple studies (as described below).  NICHD anticipates that the repository will periodically distribute portions of stored samples to laboratories at the direction of the Government.  

Since the inception of the BPCA 2002, NICHD has awarded approximately fifteen (15) individual projects to organizations for the purposes of gathering information to improve pediatric therapeutics and inform pediatric labeling.  Samples from these ongoing studies may be integrated into the samples collected and processed from future studies described in this notice.  Further information relating to the BPCA can be found at:  http://bpca.nichd.nih.gov/.  In September 2007, BPCA was reauthorized as part of the FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA).  The legislation directs NICHD to initiate studies of critical importance to specific pediatric therapeutic areas to obtain results that will be submitted to FDA for consideration of labeling changes, and used to improve pediatric therapeutics.  NICHD anticipates that the clinical studies conducted under BPCA 2007 will focus on the PK/PD, safety and efficacy of therapeutics (including drugs, biologics, and therapeutic lifestyle modifications) used in children, and the pre-clinical studies will provide vital information to the pediatric therapeutics development processes.  

NICHD anticipates that thousands of diverse biological specimens and chemical specimens will be collected from the preclinical (including samples from experimental animals and humans) and clinical (including samples from humans) studies conducted in 5 to 10 therapeutic areas (with multiple therapeutic approaches within each therapeutic area).  
&#61607;	Approximately 6,000 (six thousand) samples per year from phase 1 clinical studies
&#61607;	Approximately 15,000 (fifteen thousand) samples per year from phase 2 clinical studies
&#61607;	Approximately 500 (five hundred) samples per year from preclinical animal studies
&#61607;	Approximately 100 (one hundred) samples per year from formulation development studies

Biological samples may include, but are not limited to, tissue and organ samples, blood, urine, hair, nails, saliva, buccal cells, breast milk, placentas, umbilical cord, vaginal swabs, cord blood, and meconium from experimental animals as well as human participants, with studies conducted in vivo and in vitro.  Chemical and drug samples may include, but are not limited to, the active ingredient and excipients used in the formulation of a drug, solvents, vehicles, drug metabolites and breakdown products.  Samples from biologics may include materials used in preparing these therapeutic approaches, as well as samples from animals or humans treated with these therapies.  Additionally, prepared ampulated samples, such as digestates or extracts, and residual drug, chemical or biologic samples may be required to be stored. 

Plans for a repository for the multiple therapeutic studies being considered are evolving.  Technical requirements for the repository include shipping all samples directly from specific study sites to a central receiving repository where they will be processed, alliquotted and stored.  It is anticipated that some studies will be conducted outside of the United States, predominantly in European Union (EU) countries.  All sample processing, shipping and storage activities will be conducted under Good Laboratory Procedures (GLP) and other relevant regulatory requirements for studies conducted in the EU and US with Data being submitted for regulatory consideration (FDA, EMEA).  Periodically, at the direction of the Government, the repository will send aliquots to analytic and clinical laboratories.  Alternatively, some samples may be shipped first to the primary analytic and clinical laboratories for analysis with remaining material sent to the main repository.  The ability to move a fraction of the biological and drug samples to a separate geographic location is required to mitigate the risk of sample loss in a disaster.  

The repository shall be located in facilities with specific space allocated from the purpose of this contract, including back-up electrical supplies for computers and storage resources.  

The RFP will be available electronically on or about May 27, 2008 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the June 2008 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-26. This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 611310. 

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services from Dr. Xiaolei Huang with LeHigh University on a sole source basis. Professional services are required over a 12-month period to (1) investigate alternatives for, and to implement a system for network computing for biomedical image processing and (2) refine the development of algorithms for the segmentation of digitized uterine cervix images. Both of these activities will support Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) of biomedical images for the National Library of Medicine (NLM). (1) As part of NLM R&D work to create a Content-Based Image Retrieval System for biomedical images, research and development are required to develop techniques to develop a computing system that will allow exploitation of computing resources at NLM during the hours when they are not used; this system will allow image processing algorithms and data to be distributed among available machines for the computational solution of a larger image processing problem in pipelined fashion. (2) In addition, work is required to segment regions within uterine cervix images in order to index these images by content. Existing NLM algorithms which segment biomedical images by color and/or texture, using methods based on Support Vector Machine technology, will be improved and extended. The focus of the work will be on segmentation of acetowhitened regions in these images, but the methods developed will be analyzed and extended, where feasible, for the segmentation of other significant tissue regions on these images, including squamous epithelium and columnar epithelium. 

Proposed Work: The scope of the work is (I) investigating and experimentally evaluating the use of multiple PCs for computer-intensive image processing tasks, such as feature extraction from images, and (II) extending existing NLM capabilities for the segmentation of uterine cervix images. For (I), the specific work required is as follows: (1) examine alternative open-source approaches, taking the BOINC software as one possible solution to be examined; compare the technical strengths of the alternative approaches; (2) investigate which computing paradigms* are supported by the alternatives; (3) in consultation with the government, select one approach; (4) implement a computing framework based on this approach; (5) test the framework with a proof-of-concept computing task. 

*In order of complexity, these are the paradigms of interest to the government: 1. Simple SIMD. In this paradigm, a central node (the executive node) distributes different sets of data to N computing nodes. Each node carries out identical instructions and outputs a result set. The executive node gathers the result sets. 2. SIMD with pipeline processing. In this paradigm, the N computing nodes are subdivided into N1, N2,Nm groups. Each group carries out identical instructions (each node in the group may receive different sets of data, though); each node in a group outputs a result set; the executive gathers the result sets for a group, and may use these results to compute the input data for the next group. 3. Complex algorithm processing. The executive and computing nodes carry out all of the processing and data exchange for an image processing algorithm of the complexity of Active Shape Modeling. (It is expected that this may not be practical within the scope of this contract, or the contractor may conclude that the underlying computing infrastructure is necessarily highly problem-specific for complex algorithms, but the contractor should perform at least a short feasibility analysis with recommendations.) In this respect, a distributed computing project implementation of Active Shape Models (e.g. modeling of the uterine cervix and model-based segmentation) is recommended. 

Requirements. Below are the desired features of the implementation. Because this is a research and development effort, it is not known a priori whether all of these requirements can be met. The contractor will take these requirements as technical goals, and will advise the government during the course of the work, which requirements can be met, and what technical trade-offs are feasible. The resulting implementation should satisfy the following requirements, subject to the above qualification: (1.) It should operate on both Windows and Linux platforms, on ordinary workstation-class machines. (2.) Computing nodes should not require hosting on server hardware and should not require server software. Server software is hosted by the server (or executive node). The server machine should not require special proprietary server operating system or application software. The server machine may be a ordinary workstation-class hardware. (3.) The implementation should be practical for computational use on workstations during off-duty or nighttime hours. (4.) The proof-of-concept should include processing of some standard image processing features used in classification and CBIR work, including color histograms, GLCM matrices, and Gabor-based features. The implementation should be modular and flexible so that new image processing tasks, such as watershed segmentation, Active Shape modeling, can be easily plugged in. (5.) The implementation should provide for consistency checking of data transmitted and received between a computing node and the executive node, for example, by a bi-directional handshake. (6.) The implementation should allow, by empirical measurement, the I/O rate between the executive and a node, and the computational capability of each node, and the executive. This data then can be used to properly apportion the quantity of data distributed to each node to minimize total computation time for a problem. (7.) The implementation should work, if possible, in a heterogeneous environment with a mix of Windows or Linux machines. 

For (II) the work required is as follows: (1) Investigate interactive segmentation methods in terms of speed, accuracy, usability, scalability, and reproducibility (i.e. whether an algorithm produces consistent results given different seed-point initializations). Interactivity may include such actions as marking points or small regions on the image to be segmented as cues for the segmentation algorithm, interactively selecting image weights from the training set of images, and improved editing of the segmented image (to include features such as undo/redo capability for deleting/restoring connected regions). Investigate the concept of using relevance feedback to improve the segmented results. Create an interactive segmentation implementation with a Web interface that is built upon existing NLM uterine cervix SVM segmentation algorithms. (2) Investigate and make recommendations for future tasks to possibly incorporate new algorithms, new interactive functionality, and possibly new features (beyond color) for the segmentation of all anatomy and features of interest in the uterine cervix: cervix ROI, acetowhite tissue, squamous epithelium, columnar epithelium, os, squamous metaplasia, blood, mucus, cysts in an interactive segmentation system. The result of this part of the work is a technical analysis and recommendations. Experimental results to support the analysis are highly desirable, but not a requirement.

REQUIRED TASKS: The work described in the Proposed Work section shall be completed. Below, that work is divided into three required subtasks and presented in summary form. All software delivered shall be coded in MATLAB, except the Web interface, which shall use standard Web technology, (such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, or PHP), the networking computing capability (which may use C/C++ or other standard programming languages, with the goal of being hardware-platform independent), or except as negotiated with the government. All software delivered shall include source code and documentation. 
Task description: Subtask 1: Investigate alternatives for solutions for network computing for image processing and implement a solution which operates at a preliminary level. Extend segmentation capability for segmenting acetowhite regions on uterine cervix cervicography images using Support Vector Machine algorithms by implementing a preliminary version of an interactive segmentation system. Carry out the subtask, according to the requirements in the Proposed Work. Subtask 2: For network computing for image processing, implement a solution which achieves simple SIMD and SIMD with pipelined processing, and satisfies as many of the specified requirements as possible. Provide analysis of tradeoffs and factors affecting the use of the implementation for a complex image processing algorithm, such as Active Shape Modeling. Implement a network-computing version of ASM, if feasible. Extend segmentation capability for segmenting acetowhite regions on uterine cervix cervicography images using Support Vector Machine algorithms by implementing a final version of an interactive segmentation system. Provide a technical analysis and recommendations for future tasks toward the creation of an interactive segmentation system for all anatomy and tissue regions of interest on the uterine cervix. Carry out the subtask, according to the requirements in the Proposed Work. 

For subtasks 1-2, the Contractor shall use cervicography images made available by the government.

This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the June 2008 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-26. This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 611310. 

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services from Dr. Sari-Sarraf with Texas Tech University on a sole source basis. Professional services are required over a 12-month period to develop algorithms and create open source implementations of these algorithms for creation of an interactive segmentation system for the efficient, computer-assisted segmentation of biomedical images, using image processing support from a consumer-grade Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and commercial workstation-level computing platform. This system will support image indexing work for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) projects at the National Library of Medicine (NLM).

Proposed Work: The specific work required is as follows: (1) conduct research and development into the implementation of image indexing algorithms on consumer-level graphics processing units (GPUs) by building on previous NLM algorithm development in this area; (2) create an interactive texture segmentation tool, generalizing concepts implemented in Mortensens intelligent scissors approach, which uses image processing functions that have been implemented on a GPU. In more detail: 

(1) Conduct research and development into the implementation of image indexing algorithms on consumer-level graphics processing units (GPUs). The contractor shall study the architecture and design of the nVidia video card, which hosts a 768 MB GeForce 8800 GTX GPU, and shall report on latest technological reports from the technical literature in the use of the card for medical or general image processing, and in the use of software development and implementation tools for use with the video card; the contractor shall implement an up-to-date development environment on a workstation that hosts the card; 

(2) Implement an interactive segmentation system which exploits use of the GPU for segmentation speed, multiple simultaneous segmentation with varying input parameters, or other enhancements recommended by the contractor, and negotiated with the government, that have the potential to significantly enhance user segmentation throughput and/or quality. A goal of the system is to allow the rapid and accurate segmentation of significant objects in a biomedical image by a technician who has been trained in the likely visual characteristics of the objects to be segmented.The system shall be evaluated on region segmentation in images provided by NLM, including color uterine cervix images. Initial approaches that should be studied include Mortensens intelligent scissors concepts and active contour modeling. The techniques may be specially tuned to the uterine cervix images by parameter settings, but should also be fully functional on general images, independent of factors such as image size, color, grayscale, or modality of acquisition, as long as the required texture characteristics are present in the images. This system will be evaluated on a test set of images supplied by NLM. The test set will include color uterine cervix images; the contractor will use the segmentation system to interactively segment regions on these images and evaluate these segmentations against those marked by experts. The tissue types/anatomy/visual phenomena segmented may include any or all of the following: cervix region, os, cysts, squamous epithelium, columnar epithelium, squamous metaplasia, blood, mucous, invasive cancer. 

(3) For image processing functions, which are implemented on the GPU to support the interactive segmentation, provide a callable interface so that the functions are usable outside of the segmentation system. A list of example image processing functions which are of interest to the government for GPU implementation is given below. The actual image processing functions implemented on the GPU will be determined by the contractor, in cooperation with the government, in the course of the R&D for the interactive segmentation system. 

Example functions: Gabor filters, Gray-level coocurrence matrices, Hu moments, Color space transforms: RGB/Lab, RGB/Luv, RGB/HSV, Graylevel and color histogram computation, Discrete Wavelet Transform, Gradient images and other quantities useful for image pre-processing for Intelligent Scissors interactive segmentation, Generalized Hough Transform, Mathematical morphology operations (opening, closing, erosion, dilation, watershed), Graylevel and color histogram computation.

REQUIRED TASKS: The work described in the Proposed Work section shall be completed. Below, that work is divided into two required subtasks and presented in summary form. Software for GPU image processing shall be coded in C++/C, consistently with the requirements of the GPU development system. The segmentation system, and all user interfaces shall be coded in MATLAB, except as negotiated with the government. All software delivered shall include source code and documentation. Task description: Subtask 1: Provide updated analysis of feasibility of image processing on consumer level graphics processor units (GPUs), including report on state-of-the-art achievements from the technical literature for general image processing and medical image processing. Develop design and initial implementation for an interactive segmentation system that exploits GPU processing. All parts of this subtask should be accomplished according to the requirements in the Proposed Work. Subtask 2: Provide final implementation of an interactive segmentation tool that exploits GPU processing for enhancements to user throughput, quality of segmentations, or other significant enhancements to the interactive segmentation process. Evaluate on images provided by NLM, which will include uterine cervix images with labeled regions which may be used as reference or truth segmentations. All parts of this subtask should be accomplished according to the requirements in the Proposed Work. For subtasks 1-2, the Contractor will use image data provided made available by the government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, is issuing a DRAFT Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-08-R-0013, for the Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance (NS CTA).  The purpose of the United States Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance (NS CTA) Program Announcement (PA) is to solicit offers to establish a new Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA) in the area of Network Science consisting of four components: a Social/Cognitive Networks Research Center, an Information Networks Research Center, a Communication Networks Research Center, and an Integration Research Center to lead, evaluate and leverage research from the other three Centers as well as other research entities and overall management of the NSCTA.  The Army envisions this alliance will bring together government, industrial, and academic institutions to address research and development to enable Network Centric Operations.  The DRAFT NS CTA PA has been posted at the NS CTA website: www.arl.army.mil/networkscience.com. This PA will result in the award of two instruments:  (1) a cooperative agreement as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the Fundamental Research Component; and (2) a procurement contract as defined in 31 U.S.C. 6303 for the execution of the Technology Transition Component.  The cooperative agreement for the Fundamental Research Component will be awarded to a Consortium consisting of the four Principal Members of the Research Centers set forth above.  This Consortium may also include General Members as necessary and appropriate to fulfill the goals of the NS CTA Program. The Principal Members associated with the Research Centers for Information Networks, Social/Cognitive Networks, and Communications Networks must be academic concerns.  Each of the three Research Centers is required to include an HBCU/MI as the Principal or as a General Member.  The Principal Member for the Integration Research Center is expected (but not required to be) an industrial concern with academic involvement and will also be considered the Lead of the Consortium.  The procurement contract will be awarded to the Lead of the Consortium.  Individual tasks will be issued under the procurement contract as transition opportunities are identified from the research results under the cooperative agreement.   Under this PA, proposals are sought to select the four Principal Members for the NS CTA.  Proposals must address only one of the four research areas described above.  Should an offeror desire to propose under more than one of the research areas, a complete separate proposal must be submitted for each area.  The cooperative agreement award will be made to a Consortium consisting of four Principal Members selected for award and any General Members included in their proposals.  Planned funding levels for the NS CTA are set forth in the PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the Network Science consortium for five years with an option for an additional five years.  An Opportunity Conference will be conducted on Wednesday, 27 August 2008, at Sheraton Imperial Hotel in Research Triangle Park, NC. The purpose of the Opportunity Conference is to provide potential offerors with technical and business information concerning the NS CTA and to provide an opportunity for potential offerors to discuss the NS CTA with Government personnel.  Details concerning registration and logistics associated with the Opportunity Conference can be found at: http://www.armyuniversityopportunities.com/.  All presentations provided at the Opportunity Conference will be posted subsequently on the NS CTA website.  In addition, all questions and answers resulting from the conference that do not include proprietary information will be posted on the NS CTA website.  Interested offerors are strongly encouraged to thoroughly review the draft PA prior to attending the Opportunity Conference.

<DESC>Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, MA--Intent to sole source procurement under FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source with BioSpherix, LTD PO Box 87 19 Demott Street Lacona, NY 13083 for the following items (brand name or equal):The Contractor shall provide same or similar product: Culture Chambers:Contractor shall provide a set of 2 culture chambers (two 2 shelf "C" chambers) will be designed to be inserted into any existing temperature controlled incubator with an access port hole at least 1.5 inch in diameter or flexible door seals through which cable and tubing of umbilicals can pass.  Chambers will be built out of 0.125" clear Lexan.The "C" Chamber dimensions will be 14"w x 12"d x 6"h with a front door opening of 13.5"w x 5" h.  Chambers will be built with one perforated stainless steel slide-out tray on which culture dishes can be placed.  Inside each chamber the tray will have a usable surface area for plates of 12.75" x 10.25" with 2" clearance above the tray.  Front door will hinge on bottom and close by magnetic latch.  Chamber will include a removable stainless steel water pan bottom for humidification.  Chamber will stand on 4 non-skid feet and will have an integral mount for OXYCYCLER actuator pods.  Atmosphere controlled in chamber will be normobaric and designed to exhaust into host incubator, unless exhaust tubing (included) is used to direct exhaust outside host incubator to completely isolate chamber atmosphere from atmosphere of host incubator.OXYCYCLERTM controller:The controller will be a dual chamber O2/CO2 controller (OXYCYCLERTM model C42) designed to sit outside the host incubator and from this remote location be attached to the two chambers inside the incubator via 2 flexible hose/wire harness umbilicals threaded through the incubator access port.  It will control normobaric gas oxygen tensions to within 0.1% over the full 0.1-99.9% range simultaneously in all chambers but independently in each. Control action will be bi-directional with oxygen gas infusion for raising oxygen and nitrogen gas infusion for lowering oxygen. It will control at any single oxygen setpoint or control at multiple oxygen setpoints with precisely timed changes from one setpoint to the next (profiles). Profiles can be started and stopped at any time in any chamber without affecting any other chamber.  Each profile can consist of up to 20 different oxygen setpoints with virtually any rate of change from one setpoint to the next.  Any profile can be cycled continuously or cycled any defined number of times up to 99 times.  Any profile can be stored and repeated later at any time in any chamber.

<DESC>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) plans to digitize the entire collection of legacy materials that have been disseminated through the Federal Depository Library Program. The estimated size of the collection is approximately 2.2 million documents, which amounts to about 90 million pages.  GPO is requesting information from industry specifics to the digitization of publications that are within scope of GPO?s dissemination programs that only exist in tangible format. Information received by GPO on this effort will be used to assess the viability of GPO?s digitization plans, and may be used to revise GPO?s Federal Digital System (FDsys) documentation and plans in order to deliver key content functionality.
GPO envisions a cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship with a private or public sector participant where the fully faithful, uncompressed, unaltered files created as a result of the conversion process are delivered to GPO. These files will serve as the digital master copies that will be preserved and used for the creation of access derivatives within FDsys. In exchange, the private or public sector participant will be able to maintain a collection of files produced in the process for inclusion in their collections (e.g., search indices, book search sites). 

Background on GPO?s Digitization Efforts
In ?A Strategic Vision for the 21st Century", released in December 2004, the U.S. Government Printing Office put forth a plan to digitize all Federal publications back to the earliest days of the republic. The Vision included the development of a Digital Content System, as put forth in plans for FDsys. One of the strategic goals of the Vision is to digitize a complete legacy collection of tangible U.S. Government publications to ensure a no fee public access to these materials that remain available, in the public domain, for permanent public access.






The legacy collection of tangible Federal publications consists of approximately 2.2 million titles held in depository library collections located throughout the United States and the territories. Best estimates place the total page count at over 90 million pages. The collection consists of publications in many different forms, including books, pamphlets, oversized maps and posters, and microform. Most of the materials that are expected to be digitized in conjunction with this effort are mainly books, pamphlets, and microform (microfiche). While the overall goal of the project is to digitize the entire collection of Federal publications, GPO may consider a phased approach for the execution of the digitization and may have several private or public sector participants assisting with the project.   

The objective of this digitization effort, and the driving factor in GPO digitization, is to ensure that these materials are available, in the public domain, for no-fee permanent public access through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). 

GPO has set standards for the digitization process. While GPO envisions a relationship where a private or public sector participant provides the actual digitization services for most publications of standard size and structure, GPO may digitize a number of documents in-house (or collaborate with other Federal agencies or Federal Depository Libraries), which may include rare or fragile documents requiring special handling, oversized documents requiring a planetary scanner, or any document requiring ?rush? processing. In addition, GPO envisions a collaborative workflow in which the private or public sector participant could flag specific parts of a publication (e.g., oversized foldouts) that will be digitized by GPO, a Federal agency, or a Federal Depository Library.  

Background in the Federal Depository Library Program
For more than 140 years, The Government Printing Office (GPO) has kept America informed by producing and distributing Federal government information products. GPO combines conventional technology with state-of-the-art methods whether providing public access to Government information online, or producing or procuring printed publications that serve the information needs of the U.S. Congress, Federal agencies and the American public. Established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Government?s information, this program involves the acquisition, format conversion, and distribution of depository materials and the coordination of Federal depository libraries in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.

The mission of the FDLP is to disseminate information products from all three branches of the Government to over 1,250 libraries nationwide. Libraries that have been designated as Federal depositories will maintain this information product as part of their existing collection and are responsible for assuring that the public has free access to the material provided by the FDLP.

Background on FDsys:

In response to the growing need to have a centralized repository of Federal Government content, GPO is developing a system (FDsys) that will manage, authenticate, preserve, and provide version control for content that falls within scope of GPO?s dissemination programs. FDsys will ingest, preserve, and provide access to the information produced by all three branches of the U.S. Government. The proposed system is envisioned as a comprehensive, systematic, and dynamic means for preserving any type of digital content, independent of specific hardware and/or software. 

FDsys will enable GPO customers to obtain hard copy publications and to electronically access the content they want, and it will enable GPO to deliver that content in the formats its customer?s desire. The system is intended to automate many of the content lifecycle processes and make it easier to deliver the content in formats suited to the needs of GPO customers. 

Content in FDsys will include all known Federal Government documents, but is specifically targeted to those within the scope of GPO?s Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), whether printed or born digital. This content will be entered into the system and then authenticated and catalogued according to GPO metadata and document creation standards. Content may include text and associated graphics, video and sound and other forms of content that emerge. Content will be available for Web searching and Internet viewing, downloading and printing, and as document masters for conventional and on-demand printing, or other dissemination methods. 
All files created as a result of the digitization process will be ingested, managed, authenticated, preserved, and accessed through FDsys. 
Background Material
Additional background material is available through various locations on GPO?s website. It is strongly encouraged that all attendees be familiar with the following documents:
?	FDsys Concept of Operations - V 2.0 (PDF) - The document which provides a high-level conceptual vision of the FDsys.

?	FDsys Requirements Document - V 3.0 (PDF) - The document which identifies the preliminary requirements for the FDsys.

?	FDsys Operational Specification for Converted Content (Version 3.3): (PDF) ? The document which identifies the detailed specifications for converted content to be accepted and ingested by FDsys.

?	Specifications and Operating Procedures for Quality Control: Creation of Preservation Master Files (Version 1.1): This is the specification GPO plans to use that covers all the necessary requirements and elements required for the quality control of converted, or digitized, content.

Opportunity

GPO envisions a mutually beneficial relationship with a private or public sector participant that can digitize GPO?s entire legacy collection according to the specifications outlined in GPO?s FDsys Operational Specification for Converted Content (Version 3.3), located at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/legacy/registry/fdsysspec_converted_content3.3.pdf. The private or public sector participant should also use GPO?s Specifications and Operating Procedures for Quality Control: Creation of Preservation Master Files, located at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/legacy/specification-qc-v1-1.pdf, as the basis for performing quality control of digitized content.

GPO assumes that the private or public sector participant will possess equipment and technology to perform large-scale digitization that would result in output which is in accordance to the approved GPO standards referenced above. As part of this arrangement, GPO would provide tangible documents for scanning from either in-house sources or procured via FDLP libraries, and prioritize material to be sent to the private or public sector participant for digitization. The private or public sector participant will be required to send the ?dis-bound? tangible documents back to GPO after the digitization is complete.

GPO has set standards for preservation master files that come from the digitization process. While GPO envisions a relationship where a private or public sector participant provides the actual digitization services for most publications of standard size and structure, GPO may digitize a number of documents in-house (or collaborate with other Federal agencies or Federal Depository Libraries), which may include rare or fragile documents requiring special handling, oversized documents requiring a planetary scanner, or any document requiring ?rush? processing. In addition, GPO envisions a collaborative workflow with the in which the private or public sector participant could flag specific parts of a publication (e.g., oversized foldouts) that will be digitized by GPO, a Federal agency, or a Federal Depository Library.  

As the key deliverable from this arrangement, the private or public sector participant would, at a minimum, provide to GPO the fully faithful, uncompressed, unaltered TIFF files created as a result of the scanning process. These files will serve as the digital master copies that will be preserved and used for the creation of access derivatives within FDsys. The private or public sector firm should provide GPO with derivatives of the content that may be optimized for other uses (e.g., screen or print optimized PDF files). 

GPO would also entertain proposals for the private or public sector participant hosting the digitized content and providing access to it through their search and retrieval systems. 

As part of the arrangement, the private or public sector participant could have the benefit of storing and providing access to digitize and screen optimized publications through their own channels (e.g., search indices, book content searches). 

Requested Information:

Keeping GPO?s goals in mind please outline how your company would be able to meet the digitization needs of GPO.  Potential participants who are interested in this project must submit a packet of material which includes:
1.	A single page that expresses interest in this project, listing company points of contact (name, title, email and phone) and GSA Schedule information (if applicable). 
2.	A separate White Paper and capability statement (no more than 25 pages total) that describes:
a.	Current digitization capabilities offered (including compliance with GPO?s FDsys Operational Specification for Converted Content)
b.	A statement of process that will be followed to perform digitization, including an explanation of whether digitization will result in damage to the tangible materials. 
c.	A statement of how the private or public sector participant would handle and digitize tangible products that cannot be dis-bound, such as products that are rare or fragile.
d.	The nature of the relationship envisioned with GPO, including:
i.	Key deliverables for the private or public sector participant, including:
1.	proposals for creation and delivery of derivative files in addition to the digital master files. 
2.	proposals for the level and type of technical and/or descriptive metadata than can be provided for each digitized publication
3.	Processes and methodologies for quality assurance in scanning processes
ii.	Key deliverables for GPO
iii.	Benefits of the relationship for both parties
iv.	Whether the potential participant foresees an exclusive relationship with GPO
e.	The timeline for completion of the project. 

Capability statements must be submitted as MS Word Files by noon on February 24, 2008, to agardner@gpo.gov (subject heading ?Mass Digitization Opportunity?).  Faxed copies are not acceptable.

Questions regarding capability statements, white papers and other documentation must be submitted in writing to the address listed below or agardner@gpo.gov . Questions must be submitted by February 7, 2008.

NOTICE:  This announcement is a request for information only and does not obligate the GPO in any way.

STATMENT OF WORK: 
I. Background
Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that is indicated for the prevention of thromboembolic events in children with heart disease or whom have undergone surgery for repair of congenital heart defects.  As in adults, it is also used in pediatrics to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic disease.  Warfarin consists of a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers which are metabolized by differing pathways.  S-warfarin, the more potent enantiomer, is mainly metabolized to 7 -hydroxywarfarin by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). CYP2C9 is polymorphically expressed and variant alleles (CYP2C9*2 and *3) have been shown to result in reduced clearance of free warfarin in both adults and children.  This reduction leads to an increase in the anticoagulant effect of and a consequent decrease in the mean daily dose required to maintain the international normalized ratio (INR) or the prothrombin time (PT) within the target therapeutic range. 

Initiation of warfarin treatment is often problematic in both children and adults because of multiple factors that lead to wide variations in drug response.  Physiologic and pharmacologic factors, such as interacting drugs and illnesses, can affect both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin.  Factors that affect the intestinal availability of vitamin K (e.g., dietary intake, concomitant antimicrobial administration) and/or the synthetic or metabolic fate of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (e.g., hepatocellular disease) can also affect warfarin pharmacodynamics.   This is concerning since hemorrhage is the major risk of warfarin therapy.  Bleeding events in adult patients receiving warfarin therapy have been reported to be 7.6 to 16.5 per hundred patient years with major or life-threatening bleeds occurring every 1.3 to 2.7 per hundred patient-years.  Although major bleeding can occur even at warfarin doses that are considered to be therapeutic, the risk of serious hemorrhage rises proportionately with increasing intensity of anticoagulation. 

Several investigations conducted in adult patients have suggested that genetic polymorphisms influence the safety and efficacy of warfarin. Previous studies have shown that patients with one or more variant CYP2C9 alleles have decreased warfarin dose requirements. Patients with CYP2C9*2 or *3 variant alleles require lower mean daily doses and have more frequent INR values above the upper limit of the therapeutic range during the induction phase of warfarin therapy than patients carrying only wild-type alleles. These patients also required a longer time to achieve stable dosing, and had a significantly increased risk of serious or life threatening bleeding events when compared to patients with the CYP2C9*1/*1 (homozygous wild-type) genotype. Adult studies have also shown that the maintenance dose of warfarin is significantly related to genotype. Therefore, knowing the CYP2C9 genotypes of patients and adjusting the dose of warfarin based on this information before initiating warfarin therapy may improve the clinical safety and efficacy of the drug.

It has now been shown that polymorphic expression of CYP2C9 alone does not account for the variability in the dose-response relationship for warfarin.  Warfarin exerts its pharmacodynamic effect by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme complex (VKORC) which is responsible for recycling vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to vitamin K hydroquinone. Recently, the gene that encodes vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) has been identified. Point mutations in the gene encoding VKORC1 have been shown to lead to warfarin resistance and increased dose requirements.   Collectively, the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes have been shown to account for approximately 45% of the variability in warfarin dose requirements.     

The cumulative data obtained and available computer based clinical pharmacogenetic programs for warfarin dosing ignore implications for pediatric patients.  Because of the intrinsic developmental differences in the coagulation systems, adult guidelines for antithrombotic therapy cannot be extrapolated to pediatrics.  While several warfarin studies have been performed in children, there is a paucity of data regarding how developmental expression affects warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.   This is especially true for VKORC1 where the patterns of developmental expression are not known.  Studies have also shown that body weight normalized unbound oral clearance for S-warfarin is significantly greater than that for adults and that developmental alterations occur for other proteins that influence the anticoagulation effect of warfarin (e.g., Protein C).
II. Purpose & Objective
Warfarin remains the mainstay of pediatric chronic anticoagulation therapy.  As in adults, the management of warfarin therapy is difficult and adverse effects are common.  Two distinct pediatric patient populations receive warfarin frequently; one population is the young children with complex congenital heart disease who have surgery and abnormal blood flow, and the other are the adolescent patients who have valve replacement.  Only three pharmacologic studies of warfarin in children have been conducted, and they suggest that developmental and genetic factors contribute to pediatric patient variability in response.
The purpose and objectives of the study is to examine the relationship between warfarin dosing, CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms, and patient demographic factors in order to develop a warfarin dosing algorithm that can be validated for pediatric patients.
Hypothesis: DNA polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 are predictive of warfarin dose requirements in children once a stable INR has been achieved.
III. Purpose & Objective
Pediatric centers with anticoagulation clinics will be recruited for participation, and one PPRU will coordinate the clinical centers.  The study will take place in two phases; a data collection phase which will generate sufficient data for the construction of a dosing nomogram, and a prospective phase in which patients will be randomized to routine management versus nomogram-guided dosing.  All studies will be IRB-approved at their site in order for them to participate.

Independently, and not as an agent of the U.S. Federal Government, the Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, and otherwise do all things necessary for:

A.	 Study Design

Patients less than 18 years of age who are currently followed by the participating institutions and who have received warfarin treatment for greater than 7 days within the past one year will be eligible for the study.   Patients and/or parents/guardians will be fully informed about the study during clinic visits and informed consent will be obtained from patients parent/guardian during these regularly scheduled visits or during scheduled laboratory visits that are performed as part of standard care.  When appropriate (i.e., age > 6 years), patient assent will be obtained.  

Once consent/assent is obtained, each subject will be given a study identification number. A sample of 1 mL of  whole blood (for genomic DNA) and 5mL of plasma (for warfarin R/S ratios and future studies) will be obtained with the routine blood draw. The blood sample will only be identified by the ID number. In some cases, a venipuncture will be required for patients who are not previously scheduled to have a blood test for clinical care.  This will be fully explained during the consent process.  Blood and plasma samples will be batched at the investigative sites and will be maintained at -70C until they are shipped to the Childrens Mercy Hospital Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology laboratory where the leukocyte DNA will be extracted (from whole blood) and genotype analysis will be performed.  The plasma warfarin R/S concentration ratio will be determined by quantitation of each enantiomer from plasma using a validated HPLC/MS/MS technique.  

Retrospective longitudinal review of data will then be performed and will include age, weight, height, gender, warfarin dose, other medical illness or medications, adverse effects, PT(prothrombin time), and INR(international normalized ratio).  These will be obtained from the existing patient records and documented under the study ID number.  The data will be analyzed along with the testing for genetic polymorphisms for CYP2C9 and VKORC1, and warfarin R/S ratios.

B. Subject Selection Criteria: 

1.	Recruitment of Subjects: 
Patients will be recruited from 2 hospials and 1 to 2 additional sites from the NICHD supported Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit Network that are known to have a substantial number of pediatric patients who receive warfarin.  

2.	Expected Sample Size:  Total study:  100     

3.	Number expected per study site: 34

4.	Inclusion Criteria: 
Patients who are less than 18 years of age who have received warfarin treatment for more than 7 days.

5.Exclusion Criteria:
Patients who have been on warfarin for less than 7 days or whom have been deemed to be non-compliant with treatment by the treating team will be excluded.

C. Data collection phase:  

Centers will recruit current and past patients on which they can collect DNA and data on the patients clinical course and laboratory monitoring.  When it can be coordinated with a blood draw, plasma will be obtained for an s-warfarin concentration.  The number of patients will be guided by the previous experience of the Pharmacometrics Division of OCP with adult warfarin patients.

D. Prospective evaluation phase:
Pediatric patients requiring warfarin therapy will be randomized to receive the standard of care or will be genotyped and have their warfarin dosing determined by a pediatric dosing nomogram.  The primary outcome measure will be time to stable INR.

E. Methods/Observations/Measurements:
Information on previous warfarin dosing, INR, illnesses, adverse effects and other medication use will be collected and analyzed on each patient from the time of initiation of the drug until the time of enrollment into the study. A database that contains information for each subject will be created and maintained by the coordinating site (Childrens Mercy Hospitals and Clinics). 

Information will be analyzed in the Pharmacometrics Division, Office of Clinical Pharmacology, US Food and Drug Administration by NONMEM. The number of patients available (n=100) should be sufficient to develop a model of warfarin dosing that can account for greater than 50% of the variability in warfarin dosing, based upon adult studies.   It is anticipated that as in adults, a multiple regression model will be used to explore the relationships between measured covariates and warfarin dose to produce a desired INR (the response surrogate endpoint). Two working assumptions in developing a multivariable predictive model are that: (1) the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes will be included in all models developed, and (2) the magnitude of the genetic effects is a strong reason to assume that effects of other predictors will not be strictly additive, and interaction terms must be considered in the models.

F. Confidentiality of Subjects and Data
After enrollment in the study, each participant will be assigned a study ID number. This number will be used to identify the blood sample. The research nurse coordinator will enter all the data from the patient into the database using only the study ID number.  The blood samples will be analyzed without any personal identifiers and results given to the PI. The investigators involved in direct care to the patient will be unaware of the genetic test results produced as part of this research investigation and will provide routine care using clinical information (which may include CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype) performed by each study site.

1.	What subject identifiers are used in: 
a.	study documents to funding agency
Subjects will be identified only by a unique study number
b.	study documents retained at CMH 
Subjects will be identified only by a unique study number

2.	Where will data be stored and how will confidentiality be maintained? 
Data will be stored in a locked drawer and locked computer file in the PI's office.  Access to the key will be limited to the PI and a study nurse coordinator. The data that will be entered into the database the computer will be coded, and the link between the coded data and the subjects will be kept in the research files in the locked cabinet in the PIs office.

3.  Will tissue/blood samples be stored beyond the end of the study?   
	Data will be kept after completion of this study for 10 years. Identifiers will be destroyed after the completion of the study.  This will be clearly stated on the consent form. 

G. Metric for Evaluating impact:

The impact of these studies are to establish a new standard of care for pediatric patients who require warfarin therapy.  If we can establish a warfarin dosing nomogram that functions more efficiently than traditional fixed arbitrary dosing at rapidly achieving a stable INR in warfarin-treated children, then the outcome will be a major advance in drug therapy for pediatric patients.  The nomogram will be available to all clinicians via the Internet, and it will establish a new standard of care for warfarin dosing in pediatric patients.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the U.S. Forest Service to acquire any product or services. It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. The information requested will be used by the U.S. Forest Service to facilitate decision making.

In accordance with FAR 37.2, agencies may contract for advisory and assistance services, when essential to the agencys mission, to 

(1) Obtain outside points of view to avoid too limited judgment on critical issues;
(2) Obtain the opinions, special knowledge, or skills of noted experts;
(3) Enhance the understanding of, and develop alternative solutions to, complex issues;
(4) Support and improve the operation of organizations; or
(5) Ensure the more efficient or effective operation of managerial or hardware systems.

The US Forest Service is issuing this request for information as part of market research to obtain various strategic professional business advice and assistance services for recreation management on National Forest System lands at locations throughout the United States, and its territories.  The business advice and assistance services may include elements such as:  strategic planning and program management; financial analysis; market analysis; operations efficiency evaluations; partnership analysis; facility management planning; marketing; interpretation strategy; and, organizational change management.

In a continuing effort to meet the publics demands and expectations for recreation opportunities and to maximize the value of available funds, a need has been identified for professional business consulting services to assist with the development and implementation of a more business-based approach to U.S. Forest Service recreation management.  

The Forest Service anticipates requesting business consulting services on an as needed basis for a variety of tasks.  These tasks may vary from being national in scope to affecting only one Region or National Forest.  For example, at the national level the agency may be interested in exploring options for enhancing partnership capabilities and expanding contributed income funding opportunities.  Services may be requested to help identify strategies and the Agency may seek assistance in pursing implementation support for the strategies. 

If you are an interested large or small business, please complete the attached questionnaire and provide the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative the U.S. Forest Service may contact for additional information.  
Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the AFMS requirements. Individual capability briefs will not be accepted at this time. Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at www.fedbizopps.gov for future announcements regarding U.S. Forest Service needs.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a one base year plus two option years with the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD) to continue training and technical assistance to the 64 University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDDs). 

The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

 The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD), located within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the Federal agency responsible for implementation and administration of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act of 2000) (42 U.S.C. 15001, et seq.).  The DD Act authorizes the following national grant programs: State Councils on Developmental Disabilities; State Protection and Advocacy Systems for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities' Rights; National Network of University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, Education, Research, and Service; and Projects of National Significance. ADD is responsible for administering these grant programs that engage in four core functions: (1) interdisciplinary preservice preparation and continuing education, (2) community services and technical assistance, (3) research, and (4) information dissemination. The goal of this assistance is to improve program performance, statutory compliance, and program outcomes across the national network of UCEDDs.  This contract will enable training and technical assistance to the UCEDDs that provide preservice preparation, community service, and new knowledge to fields related to developmental disabilities.  

The training and technical assistance provided under this contract covers a wide array of activities, including training, consultation, information exchange and dissemination, promotion of best practices, and capacity building.  AUCD is the national membership organization for the UCEDD program. It is a 501(c) non-profit organization that promotes and supports a network of university centers on disabilities, which includes the UCEDDs, Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND) Programs, and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers (DDRC).  

As a membership organization, AUCD serves as a clearinghouse for the national network of UCEDDs and provides cohesiveness across the 67 UCEDDs.  The 67 UCEDDs view AUCD as a trusted source and resource for developing cutting edge, state of the art approaches to preservice preparation, community services, research, and information dissemination. For training and technical assistance to be relevant to the UCEDDs, it is necessary to have an entity with the in depth knowledge and understanding of the operations and needs of the UCEDDs.  Since AUCD is the membership organization for the UCEDDs, it has the unique insight and experience necessary for providing technical assistance to this national network. The 67 UCEDDs view AUCD as their hub for training and technical assistance thereby making AUCD distinctively qualified to provide such services across the UCEDD network. The 67 UCEDDs have invested time, money, and effort to develop this membership organization, which has created a level of trust the UCEDDs can depend on to provide the support needed to achieve the mission of the program. Due to its history and connections to the UCEDD program, AUCD is inimitably positioned to provide training and technical assistance under this contract. 

There is no other entity with the innate and exclusive ability to provide the appropriate training and technical assistance to the 67 UCEDDs across the United States and territories.  

Vendors who are interested in this acquisition should submit a statement of capabilities including detailed documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirements. The statement of capabilities must specifically demonstrate the following: 1. Experience in providing training and technical assistance to the national network of UCEDDs; 2. Experience in conducting workshops, conferences, and technical assistance site visits to UCEDDs; 3. Experience with the UCEDD data management system used for measuring outcomes and reporting annually to ADD; and 4. Ability to provide staff that has proven successful academic and professional work experiences in the field of developmental and other significant disabilities; proven ability to direct and mange projects of this magnitude including accounting/bookkeeping; proven experience in providing and coordinating training and technical assistance activities; and proven experience in managing contracts or programs for training and technical assistance as a project director.  

Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source award to AUCD.  Responses must be submitted within 20 days from the date of publication of this notice. No solicitation is available.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The Coast Guard will consider the information provided by qualified suppliers in the development of the avionics modernization plan for the H-65.

Additional Project Details and Requirements

1.0	Scope
The ELT system may be installed in all Coast Guard aircraft.  The requirement will include spares.  The system and associated support plans will be designed to minimize Coast Guard inventory requirements.   

2.0	Background
The Coast Guard currently operates (97) H-65 aircraft.  The fleet is being expanded to 102 aircraft.  The Coast Guard is seeking to simplify logistics and reduce engineering development costs by incorporating a common ELT in Coast Guard aircraft.   

The H-65 is a derivative of the Eurocopter Dauphin aircraft.  The current configuration is similar to the AS 365N3.  The aircraft was originally built to FAR part 29 standards.  Modifications to the aircraft are designed to current FAR 29 standards with exceptions approved for Coast Guard specific requirements.  

The international COSPAS-SARSAT Program will phase out 121.5 MHz satellite alerting on 1 February 2009.  The new standard is an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) that operates on 406 MHz.

3.0	Modernization Planning

Planned H-65 avionics systems improvements will replace existing equipment with current available commercial and government-supplied components.  The new system will include dual Honeywell HG764/GU Embedded GPS Inertial Navigation systems (EGI).

4.	Vendor Qualification
The supplier must be an original equipment manufacturer for Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) systems.  The supplier must have been approved by the US Department of Defense (DOD), GSA, or US Federal Aviation Administration (or equivalent as determined by the best value source selection team) as an aircraft ELT supplier.  The supplier must have experience working with civil and military airworthiness authorities.  

The supplier must have or establish a permanent presence in the United States staffed with English speaking technical support personnel.  All system documentation must be available in readily understandable English language format.

5.	Evaluation
After evaluation of the information received, the Coast Guard may issue a separate request for proposals.

Selection and contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer provides the best value to the Government determined by a balanced, performance based evaluation of system capabilities, acceptance of the government defined comprehensive support requirements, past performance, delivery and price.

The planned system evaluation criteria are: Technical Capability, Past Performance, Risk, Experience, Delivery and Price.  Proposals that exceed the basic requirements will be considered.

The evaluation and source selection process will consider each offeror's capability to provide a technical solution that best aligns with the requirements, is within the proposed schedule, and is affordably priced.  An integrated assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each offeror's proposal, together with the cost proposed, will be used to determine which proposal offers the best overall value to the Government.  

Technical Requirements

Compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation 87.199 and Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) document titled "Minimum Operational Performance Standards 406 MHz Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)" Document No. RTCA/DO-204.

<DESC><p>Title: Automatic Stainer/cytospin for Acid Fast Bacteria Smears
<p><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV, Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention (Global AIDS Program) intends to award a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition procedures to manufacturer Wescor, Inc. 459 South Main Street, Logan, Utah 84321-5207 for the purchase of three Aerospray Acid Fast Bacteria (AFB) Slide Stainer-Cytocentrifuge; three 30-slide vented carousel for Aerospray; 3 Cytopro Rotors; ten sample Chambers w/fast, white Cytopads, P4/8; and 3 AC-160 Accessories and Supplies to improve recovery of AFB in HIV positive persons. No other products are available that are appropriate to stain AFB smears. Other automatic stainers utilize a common tank or well filled with stain in which a rack of slides are submerged. Submerging AFB smears into a common tank poses a significant risk for cross contamination and smears read as a false positive, resulting in inaccurate reporting and lead to the treatment patients that do not have active TB disease.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to GE Healthcare BioScience, 800 Centennial Avenue, Piscataway, NJ, for purchase of all necessary components to an AKTA fplc chromatography system with fraction collector. The Influenza Division Molecular Virology and Vaccine Branch have been tasked with analysis of potentially pandemic viral proteins that will be produced in Vaculovirus and bacteria. These different types of protein will need to be separated from normal cellular constituent proteins and protein aggregates by their molecular weight and by their specific charge in order to obtain pure samples. MVVB personnel are producing such proteins continuously and a secondary system is needed to keep pace with current protein production levels and also, as these proteins have specific requirements as to atmospheric temperatures, it is also highly desirable to have a smaller system that can be utilized to process the proteins at a low temperature of 4 degrees Celsius which is compatible with the existing unit. The AKTA fplc is a smaller model with a corresponding footprint that has almost the same capabilities as the system currently in operation and has identical parts which are interchangeable. This particular unit will allow for maximization of limited refrigerated space by being able to fit into and take up as little space as possible in the laboratory refrigerator and will double current capacity of the Branch. System is fully bio-inert for bio-molecule protein separation. Its extendable gate rack saves bench space. Unit is compatible with NaOH concentration above 1M and Urea and GuHCI concentration above 7M. The AKTA fplc has a flow range of 0.05-20.0mL/min and is robust for high salt concentrations and viscous buffers, with transparent cylinders in which air bubbles can be detected. Pump heads do not need to be changed for different flow rates and pressure limits. It is also Unicorn-based, with the ability to generate reports with Method Wizard. Unicorn software is fully compliant with CFR 21 part 11 environment, has system validation GAMP (US equivalent), and electronic signature and electronic records. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19111, intends to procure on a sole source basis with Invivo Corporation to provide 1 SMS Sym 1.5T 7Ch Biopsy Breast Array for Fort Hood, TX configured as follows:
SMS SMS 1.5T 4Ch Breast Array, part number 800162, quantity 1
It has been determined that Invivo Corporation is the best manufacturer capable of meeting this requirement for the SMS System 1.5T 7Ch Biopsy Breast Array.  Fort Hood is obtaining this array for use with an existing Siemens Symphony 1.5T MRI machine.  Compatibility is a key issue when purchasing coils for RF imaging.  This coil has a certificate of compatibility for use with the Siemens Symphony MRI system.  Fort Hood has also purchased a DynaCAD workstation that aids with breast imaging analysis.  The DynaCAD system cannot be utilized without a breast biopsy coil.
The coil was specifically designed to be compatible with 8-channel MRI systems and for use with iPAT imaging techniques.  This allows for improved aperture volume and a high Signal to Noise Ration (SNR).  The coil also allows for unilateral and bilateral imaging modes as well as medial and lateral breast access.  The key feature of this unit is the fully integrated biopsy/immobilization device.  Other coils, such as the CP Breast Array Coil, require a separate purchase of the breast biopsy array.  The coil design also allows for use of other interventional procedures using true cut and vacuum assist instruments with both medical and lateral access.
The Statuatory authority for this sole source purchase is Title 10 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented in the FAR 6.302-1(a) (2).  This notice is for informational purposes only; NO FORMAL SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED as a result of this announcement.  Interested parties may identify their interest to the address listed below, no later than August 13, 2008 at 3:00PM EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is entirely in the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by August 13, 2008 at 3:00PM EST, a sole source contract with Invivo Corporation will be pursued.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to use the University of Idaho to procure a  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service requirement for digital spatial maps that include the distributions of native species, the nature and locations of barriers to migrations, and the known distribution of target invasive species and pathogens. Imposed on these data will be other relational databases that include locations of roads, irrigation canals, and recreational access that might increase the human interactions and possibilities of introduction, along with likely habitat changes from global climate change.  This database will allow resource managers in Idaho to prioritize projects based on risks and benefits to aquatic species, the number and types of barriers within drainages, and the ability to provide passage in a cost effective manner.   POC:  Lorrie J. Gleghorn 503-231-2392.
Objectives
1) Provide GIS derived maps and summaries of the range, migration barriers, and habitat characteristics of native fish species of concern in Idaho.
2) Prepare and summarize GIS derived maps of known information on aquatic invasive species and fish pathogens in proximity to the range of fish species of concern, as well as corridors or vectors or pathways of human activity that could increase the likelihood of introduction of invasive species or pathogens within the range. 
3) Using these spatially referenced data sets, and GIS tools, provide models that can be used to prioritize and select barriers to fish migrations that if removed will result in the greatest benefit to native fish populations.
4) Using GIS tools, identify and prioritize areas of risk and needs for further evaluation and monitoring.

<DESC>Statement of Work
For
Two Internet-Based Modules That Comprise Behaviors That USDA Recommends to Prevent Pregnant Women from Contracting Listeriosis and Behaviors Necessary to Keep Young Children Save from Foodborne Illness


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is a public health agency that protects consumers by ensuring that the nation's meat, poultry products, and processed eggs are safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged.   

Foodborne illness is a preventable public health challenge.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United States annually from foodborne illnesses. Science informs us that foodborne illness can be prevented by practicing the safe food handling principles, developed by the Partnership for Food Safety Education, i.e., Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill.   Through USDAs consumer education programs generated by its Food Safety Education Staff (FSES), which includes the Meat and Poultry Hotline, the public is educated on how to safely handle, prepare, and store meat, poultry, and egg products to reduce their risk of contracting a foodborne illness.  

Everyone is at risk for contracting a foodborne illness.  However, young children, older adults, pregnant women and their unborn, and those who have weakened immune systems caused by medication and/or disease are at greater risk for more serious illness or even death should they contract a foodborne illness.  USDA has historically developed science-based safe food handling educational materials to help inform general and at-risk consumers about safe food handling practices to reduce their risk of foodborne illness.  Among the leading foodborne pathogens in the United States that often result in the most severe health consequences are L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7. Pregnant women and their unborn or newborn are among the at-risk populations that are adversely affected by L. monocytogenes and young children are among the at-risk populations that are most often affected by E. coli O157:H7. To address the public health challenges of these two pathogens, national safe food handling educational campaigns and other groundbreaking initiatives have been developed and implemented to better reach these at-risk groups.  

Historically, USDA has collaborated with WIC programs to better reach this audience.  However, to broaden the effort, FSIS desires to contract with a company capable of developing interactive Internet-based educational modules that target WIC clients, specifically pregnant women and women with young children (children 5 years of age and under) for purpose of helping them to better understand how to adopt behaviors that help reduce their risk of contracting foodborne illnesses caused by L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7. 

DESCRIPTION OF WORK

The work completed will be:

1.	Two Internet-based modules that comprise behaviors that USDA recommends to prevent pregnant women from contracting listeriosis (Module 1) and behaviors necessary to prevent young children from consuming hamburger that has not been cooked to the safe USDA-recommended minimum internal temperature (Module 2). 
2.	Developed using cleared USDA/FSIS consumer-oriented food safety publications.  
3.	Inclusive of the following specific behaviors in Module 1:
a.	Keep refrigerator at 40 F or below
b.	Do not eat unpasteurized dairy products, including soft cheeses
c.	Do not eat refrigerated pat, meat spreads from the meat counter or smoked seafood from the refrigerated section
d.	Reheat hot dogs, bologna, and other deli/luncheon meats until steaming hot before eating.
4.	Inclusive of the following specific behavior in Module 2:
a.	To be sure hamburger is safe to eat, use a food thermometer to make sure its safe minimum internal temperature is 160 F.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to negotiate solely with Johnson Controls, Inc. 60 Loveton Circle, Sparks, Maryland for the purchase of materials and labor to upgrade the currently installed York Chillers.  The procurement request encompasses the system that controls and monitors the cooling for SSAs Altmeyer, East High Rise, East Low Rise, and Operation Buildings in the Main Complex.  Therefore, this system is critical to SSAs facility management.  It is necessary to match the new equipment to the existing building management control system in the main complex in order for the two systems to interface correctly.  Both systems are proprietary.  The requirement is for the purchase of Johnson Controls Optiview Control Panel.  Recently Johnson Controls, Inc. purchased York International, Inc.  York International, Inc. (now part of Johnson Controls, Inc.) was the manufacturer and distributor of the existing Chiller system in SSAs Main Complex buildings.  Johnson Controls is the company SSA must solicit to replace critical system parts and components that are proprietary.  Interested parties who feel they can provide this requirement may respond by submitting their capability statement via email to Deborah. R. Wilson@ssa.gov by COB August 15. 2008.  The information I receive I will consider solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If I receive no responses by the closing date (8/15/08), the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with Johnson Controls, Inc.  Vendors must submit all questions and/or submissions to this notice in writing to the email address referenced above.  I will not accept telephone calls regarding this notice, nor will I return any.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity intends to issue a sole source purchase order to RXHub, LLC, 380 St Peter Street Suite 530, St, Paul, MN 55102, for a 12-month contract to conduct a feasibility analysis to facilitate DOD's participation in the commercial eRx environment.  No solicitation document exists.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability is invited to submit written notifiction to the Contracting Officer within 7 calendar days from the date of this publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated capability.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at:  USAMRAA, ATTN:  JODI CARDOZA, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5014.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  If no responses are received; USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.<BR><BR>Justification and Approval<BR>For Other than Full and Open Competition<BR>Log Number 08-096<BR>           <BR>1.  Contracting Activity.  <BR>   U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA)<BR>   820 Chandler Street<BR>   Fort Detrick, MD<BR>   <BR>2.  Description of Action.  <BR>Request a sole source, firm fixed price new contract, with RxHub LLC, using FY08 O&M funds. <BR><BR>3.  Description of Supplies or Services.  <BR>DoD Pharmacy will engage RxHub, LLC to conduct a feasibility analysis to facilitate DoDs participation in the commercial eRx environment. <BR><BR>DoD Pharmacy requires a feasibility analysis to determine whether DoD can fully participate in a commercial eprescribing intermediaries Master Patient Index (MPI).  Based on extensive market research, DoD Pharmacy has concluded that one of the key MPI parameters used to identify patients, zip code, presents a unique problem.  Active duty members and their family members may have zip codes on file which do not accurately reflect their current assigned location.  This would affect the ability for a MPI to locate them correctly.  <BR><BR>This analysis would permit DoD to 1) confirm that zip code is not an appropriate search parameter, and through this effort, 2) explore alternative attributes that would be beneficial in matching persons if zip code information is determined to be unreliable.<BR><BR><BR>4.  The Statutory Authority For This Action Is.  <BR>10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<BR><BR>5.  Reason for Authority Cited.  <BR><BR>Based on DoDs research of the commercial ePrescribing arena, there exists two commercial eprescribing intermediaries, RxHub and SureScripts.  However, there exists a significant difference between the two intermediaries.  RxHub electronically routes prescriptions from the provider to the major mail order pharmacies and SureScripts electronically routes prescriptions to retail pharmacies.  Current DoD policy is to undertake programs and initiatives to shift the filling of prescriptions by DoD beneficiaries from the retail environment (CVS, Walgreens, etc.) to the mail order program (TMOP).  <BR>RxHub has proprietary algorithms within its MPI to facilitate the beneficiary search function.  RxHub is a privately held corporation and is under no obligation to provide 3rd Party access to its proprietary systems for this analysis.  If the POD released an RFP for this analysis, RxHub would be under no obligation to provide access to its systems, sites, or business proprietary data or search algorithms.  RxHub is not currently under any obligation to open its systems to DoD or any DoD contracted vendor.<BR>RxHub only engages 3rd Party vendors it deems necessary in the normal course of its commercial business operations.   (A comparable analogy would be for DoD to contract with a 3rd Party vendor to do an analysis of Googles internal search algorithms.  As these are business proprietary, Google would not allow a 3rd Party vendor the required access to conduct such an analysis.  Other comparable examples are available.)<BR>Therefore, there are no reasonable or viable alternatives to RxHub for this feasibility analysis.  <BR><BR>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition.  <BR>No efforts were undertaken to obtain competition. <BR>Based on our extensive and timely market research, no reasonable competition could be undertaken.  RxHub is a privately held corporation and is under no obligation to provide access to its proprietary systems unless it deems necessary in the normal course of its commercial business operations.  RxHub does not currently have any contractual obligations to the US Govt and is not required to provide access to its proprietary systems to any 3rd Party entity.  <BR><BR>7.  Actions to Increase Competition.  <BR>Upon completion of this feasibility analysis, DoD Pharmacy will assess the results of this feasibility analysis and determine what future contracting actions will be required.  <BR><BR>8.  Market Survey.  <BR>The POD has conducted extensive market research in the area of electronic prescribing.  Over the past several months, March-June 08, the POD has not identified any other vendors on the GSA IT schedule.  The POD also attended the (HIMSS) conference in Feb 08 which is the preeminent showcase for health IT vendors, products and services.  During the product expo, the POD reviewed what other technologies would meet the RxHub MPI analysis requirement.  POD has not identified any new vendors or capabilities that would provide the tools and products necessary to meet the requirement.  The POD has a robust understanding of the current commercial eRx industry and its market leaders.  DoD Pharmacy continues to closely follow industry trends and attends a variety of industry specific conferences and education sessions.  For the current effort, we have determined that RxHub is and remains the only candidate capable of conducting an analysis of the RxHub MPI consistent with DoD requirements.<BR> 9.  Interested Sources.  <BR>To date, no other sources have written to express an interest.  A notice will be posted in FedBizOpps describing the Governments requirement and intent to procure sole source.  Any potential offeror expressing an interest in this requirement will be given an opportunity to submit a proposal.  <BR><BR>10.  Other Factors.  <BR>a.  Procurement History.  N/A   <BR><BR>(1)  Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards:  This is a first time procurement of this nature.   <BR><BR>(2)  Competitive status of these actions:  N/A   <BR><BR>(3)  Authority for less than full and open competition previously used:  N/A   <BR>(4)  If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, provide a 	summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an 	explanation of the results.   N/A   <BR><BR>(5)  If any prior award was accomplished by full and open competition, provide a detailed 	explanation of the changed circumstances.  - N/A   <BR><BR>(6)  Provide an explanation of any unusual patterns which may be revealed by the history, e.g., 	several consecutive, urgent buys. - N/A   <BR><BR>(7)  If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly 	describe the circumstances justifying the buy and whether there have been any significant 	changes. -   N/A   <BR><BR>b. Acquisition Data Availability.  <BR>The purpose of this effort is solely to establish a framework intended to assess the opportunity for improvements in quality of patient care, reduction of medication management errors, and process and cost efficiencies.  Subsequent to the completion of the feasibility analysis, the Department of Defense will be able to accurately identify the most appropriate product/service that corresponds to a similar scope (if applicable).  Accordingly, the Department of Defense will then be able to properly craft technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, Statements of Work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition as deemed necessary for the intended effort.  However, due to the limited scope of this effort and limited sources available to complete this requirement, it is believed that the aforementioned documents suitable for competition cannot be produced at this time.       <BR><BR>c.  Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  N/A   <BR><BR>d.  Subcontracting Competition.  <BR>N/A<BR>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

SPECIFICATION LINE ITEM 0002
Sub-Surface Magnet
GENERAL
The sub-surface magnet assembly, also called a magnetic marker, is required by the government surveyor to be deposited and oriented at the base of the hole which has been excavated for the setting of a survey monument post.  The sub-surface magnet is a cylindrical ceramic magnet housed within a plastic container.  
Magnet
The magnet shall be 7/8 +/- 1/32 inches diam. and 1 +/- 1/8 inch long. 
The magnet shall be composed of strontium ferrite (chemically inert and anisotropic)

Container 
The magnet plastic container shall be 1 7/8 to 2 5/8 inches overall length, with 1 to 1 1/8 inches square end caps on a 1 to 1 1/8 in. diam. cylinder.  It is preferable that the magnet does not move about within the plastic container.
The magnet plastic container shall be composed of polyethylene or equivalent end caps with a polyethylene or cellulose acetate cylinder or equivalent.
The magnet plastic container shall have one end cap black in color, and marked ATHIS END DOWN@, ATHIS SIDE DOWN@, ABOTTOM@, or equivalent nomenclature.  The other end cap and cylinder will be white or translucent white.  
Upon final assembly, the case shall have no holes which would permit the intrusion of water.   
General
The total weight of the magnet and plastic container is approximately 2 ounces. 
The sub-surface magnet assembly, when deposited in the ground and oriented with the black colored end cap down, shall be detectable with a Schonstedt Instrument Company magnetic locator, model No. GA52C or equivalent at a minimum range of 8 feet below a typical ground surface.
Assembly
The sub-surface magnet assembly shall be shipped assembled with the magnet contained and properly oriented in the plastic container with both end caps attached.  If the plastic end cap(s) are of a friction fit on the plastic cylinder, they shall be of a tight enough friction fit to require a minimum of 2 hands to disassemble the plastic container.  The minimum tightness of the friction fit specification is to prevent the accidental disassembly of the sub-surface magnet assembly in shipping, handling, or carrying in a backpack by a surveyor.    
In the event that a hole exists in the case for an aid for air escape during assembly, it shall be plugged with silicone type material or equivalent upon assembly to prevent later water intrusion into the case. 
The magnet will be oriented in the plastic container in order that the maximum detectable magnetic range is obtained (on the ground surface from the sub-surface magnet) when the black colored plastic end cap is placed in a downward position when the magnet is assembled in the plastic container and vertically aligned.  Shipping
The assembled sub-surface magnet assemblies, in their containers and considering their magnetic fields, will be packed vertically in a neat and orderly fashion in horizontal rows columns and vertical columns, with no spaces (not loose), and will be contained in a minimum of a cardboard box container, designed for shipping, not exceeding 2 cubic feet.
Each shipping container shall be clearly marked with the address and destination, contract number, delivery order number if applicable, item nomenclature, contractor's name, address and date of shipment, number of items per container, number of containers, and weight of each container.  
Compliance with Chapter 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Department of Transportation, hazardous material transportation, regarding  magnetized material, is the contractor's responsibility.

Elephant Butte Power plant Cooling Water Strainer Replacement
Aufust 07, 2008
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
BACKGROUNDElephant Butte Power plant has a need for replacement of 4 duplex strainers to be used for the generator cooling water systems. The existing original strainers were manufactured by a company named Elliot. The current strainers are developing holes in the separating chamber and the walls of the two chambers are becoming very thin. Some repairs have been performed in the past, but due to the age and condition of these strainers more and more repairs are being required to keep them from leaking. completed on the strainers however these repairs are needing repair and new repairs are necessary. The replacement of the strainers would eliminate this time required for repairs and down time for the generators. Elliott model R strainers have been replaced with Tate Andale model R strainers. These units must drop into position with no modification to the existing piping. The base size and flange dimensions and elevations are critical. The Tate Andale strainers are a turn key installation, as they are exactly the same body dimensions, pipe flangeelevations and alignment as the Elliott's that are installed currently (See requirement for dimension restriction).Strainers are generally manufactured on an 'as ordered' basis, there for a spare parts list is required with the strainers.
SCOPEThese strainers are used to filter the generator cooling water before it enters the generator air coolers located inside the unit air housing. The 6" cooling water pipes that enter and exit the strainers are permanently set into the surrounding concrete walls and ceilings of the gallery in the plant. The only way to move or adjust the existing pipe locations would be to use a cutting torch and then re-weld them. Much of the piping is routed very close to the concrete walls and ceiling with little to no clearance available to weld between the pipe and the concrete walls and ceiling. If any dimension is off only a fraction of an inch the pipe flanges will, not bolt up to the strainer flanges. Modifying the piping would be very costly and time consuming and should only beconsidered as a last resort. Another reason for direct replacement is that the strainers are fastened to concrete pads. Therefore if there were any modifications needed it would require jack hammering out concrete and placing a new pad.
REQUIREMENTThe strainer shall be a gate valve twin basket type capable of handling water at a flow rate of 250 GPM with an approximate pressure drop of 2 psig. The strainer shall be model R Tate Andale and suitable to a working pressure of 150 psi and a working temperature of 75F. The strainer body shall be of cast iron construction with 6" flanged inlet and outlet connections and shall have multiple yoked access cover. The body shall be a low profile design with floating valve discs, wedge action seating with instant release before valve moves to eliminate scoring. The cover shall be hinged type with multiple yokes. The two strainer baskets shall be of 304Stainless Steel constructed with 118 inch diameter perforated openings. (See next page for requirements and dimension limitations)

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source firm fixed priced purchase order to Ibis Pharmaceuticals - Ibis Division, 1891 Rutherford Road, Carlsbad, California 92008.  The purpose of this procurement is to refine and use the custom technical protocol developed by Ibis Biosciences for its Universal Biosensor under a previous contract with CDC.  The existing technical protocol has been applied to DNA from attached ticks removed from STARI patients and provisionally developed for human samples. The Universal Biosensor protocol now will be refined and applied to analyze recently collected samples from patients with STARI.  Molecular data from this instrument will assist us in developing a hypothesis about the cause of STARI.  CDC may benefit from this procurement by acquiring data that may point to the cause of STARI.  Once a cause is known, laboratory tests may then be devised by CDC staff to evaluate patients who are suspected to have this illness.

The screen for the projected image is existing screen mounted in place.  The rear projector will be installed in the custom designed dual mirror system.  The dual mirror system will need to be specifically designed with the projector and the screen due to the limited distance in the room.  A sight survey to determine the exact dual system will be required.<BR>Front Display System:  One 7700 HD front displaying standard (2) NTSC video and (2) standard XGA (1024x768) computer sources will be installed in the rear of the auditorium.  The projector will be suspended from the ceiling.  The projector will need to be equipped with a long throw lens.  The long throw lens will need to be installed in the projector.  The lens will need to be determined by a sight survey to provide correct lens and distance to the screen.  One ceiling mounted electrically operated screen will be used in the front of the room.  This screen will be 108 x 194 inches.  The screen will be used for the front projection system.  The advantage of this screen is the ability to show one large side screen application or have the ability to show multiple windows on the screen at one time through an RGB Spectrum processor.  <BR>Display Inputs:  This system will have connectivity for up to three computers.  One computer connection will be installed at the lectern, and two computer connections will be installed in the equipment room.  One 17 preview monitor will be installed in the equipment room.  Additionally, the system will be equipped with two VHS and two DVD players.  One will be installed in the lectern on the stage.  One VHS and DVD player will be installed in the equipment room.  This system will also accept up to five additional inputs.  The five additional inputs can be used for (in place) cable or satellite or additional computer inputs.<BR>Control System:  One graphic wireless LCD control interface forms the center of this A/V presentation system.  It provides simple, automatic operation of the presentation environment.  A central presentation control system will be located in the equipment room.  The controller will be used to connect and select sources, power the projectors, control the VCR and DVD, select between front or rear projection, the front projection screen, and control the volume.  One additional LCD controller will be installed in the lectern on the stage.  The controls on the panel will have the same features as the equipment rack controller.  The Crestron controllers will need to be designed with the Utah National Guard requirements before the completion of the project.<BR>Multi Function Processor:  One RGB Spectrum multi format switcher and multi window processor will be installed for this project.  The processor will allow for up to six separate windows to be displayed on the front projection screen only.  The sources will be selected from presets on the control panel.<BR>Lectern:  One custom lectern will be provided by Marshall Furniture Company for the stage.  The lectern will house the DVD and VHS players.  One Smart symposium will be installed on the lectern.  The Smart symposium will allow for the instructor to annotate on the computer presentation when in rear projection mode only.  One microphone will be installed on the lectern.<BR>Lighting Control:  The auditorium has eight rows of lighting currently.  The lighting will need to be updated to be able to provide control by the control system.  The lighting will need to be verified it can work with the Crestron control system.<BR>Ethernet Interface:  This system has been IP enabled to be interfaced, monitored and controlled through the network.  This allows the system to be easily upgraded for the ability to be interfaced with other rooms for feature such as remote administration and monitoring.<BR>Audio System:  This system utilized four (in place) JBL ceiling speakers.  The speakers, Biamp Audio system and amplified which are controlled separately from the Crestron control system.  Four (in place) Shure wireless microphone systems will be connected to the system.<BR>Stage Lighting:  There are two (2) lights in the existing lighting system referred to as spot lights.  They are to be replaced with two focused spot lights.  The stage lighting would be 6 to 8 lights each at a rating of 750 to 1000 watt variable focus spots to flood lights placed on either side of the auditorium on the wall or vicinity of the steel support columns.  The stage would then be lighted in three to four controlled sections lit across the entire stage.<BR>Stage Drapery:  Stage drapery is requested for the front of the stage.  The stage drapes could be manual or controlled by the Crestron controller system (the final decision will be made at the walk through) opened when the rear projection system is in use.  The drapery color requested is grey and would need to cover 70 wide and 8 high.<BR>System Implementation:  Selected Vendor will provide a turnkey multimedia system to include equipment, implementation and warranty.  Installation includes engineering, coordination and labor for display, video, audio, smart control systems and related equipment to include required plates, connectors and cables.<BR>System Engineering, to include:  <BR>1.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2008-206-DDC and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334519 and the business size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the services from PI (Physik Instrument)L.P.,16 Albert Street, Auburn, MA., 01501, the following:

1. Part Number: XYZ Piezo Nanopositioning/Scanning Stage, 200x200x20m, Parallel Direct Metrology, quantity one (1) each
2. Part Number: E-710.3CL, Digital Piezo Controller, 3 Channels, Sub-D Connector, quantity one (1) each.

The sole source determination is based on the fact the xyz piezo stage and associated digital controller are needed to construct a high-resolution single-molecule confocal fluorescence microscope in the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics.  This single-molecule confocal microscope will be used to measure the activity of single proteins or protein complexes interacting with DNA.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September, 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 97-27. This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541219 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million. 
It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mr. John Mahoney, Brinklow, Maryland, to provide expert management and budgetary services to the NIH Business System (NBS) project. NIH recently completed a comprehensive management and systems analysis to define the requirements for a new administrative computing system and evaluated potential systems to satisfy these requirements. This analysis has determined that the NIH must replace its current system with an off-the-shelf software product. As part of this implementation, NIH has engaged the services of numerous functional specialists to help design and configure the software to suit NIH needs. NIH is seeking the assistance from an individual with a detailed understanding of NIH management, budget along with related administrative systems experience and expertise in these issues. NIH requires the detailed technical services to support the NBS project for a period of two years and six months. Specifically, the contractor shall support the NBS Project Manager in the following areas: 1) Developing and maintaining the balanced scorecard evaluation approach, with specific attention to the project monitoring level, for the NBRSS implementation phase. 2) Developing and implementing a monitoring and review methodology specifically checking the System Integrators adherence to the Project Plan, the proposed budget, and overall schedule. This methodology will incorporate earned value calculations. 3) Maintaining and monitoring tracking chart that follows the schedule of NBS activities to be accomplished prior to the start of activities of the functional work teams. 4) Performing policy and issue analyses for the NBRSS project on a myriad of topics as assigned by the Project Manager. Following these analyses, develops appropriate policy documents/memoranda/reports/presentations for NBRSS review. Mr. Mahoney will also support NIH management and administration in the following areas: 1) Assisting the Chair, Funding Advisory Review Board in administering a process that analyzes competing corporate funding proposals, provides priority funding recommendations to NIH senior management and ensures that out-years costs for proposed projects have been identified  and set forth as part of a 3-year planning process; 2) Coordinating the staff analysis of proposals submitted to the Board to assure that members have sufficient information upon which to make prioritized funding recommendations ; and 3) Providing advice to the Board on overall funding strategies considering the overall resources required to fund the competing proposals, and the likely resources that will be available to NIH for these proposals. Mr. Mahoney has provided expert management services to the Office of the Director, Office of Management for the last three years, under several purchase orders. Mr. Mahoneys previous experience with the NIH uniquely qualifies him as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary services. This requirement represents a continuation of the services he is currently providing to the NBS project. He therefore will require no orientation to NIH management and related administrative issues. He has an extensive knowledge of NIH management and administrative issues. He has vast management knowledge of the type required by the NBS project. NIH has determined that Mr. Mahoney is the source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience that can successfully complete the requirements listed above. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all proposals received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NIH. Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.

The University of Maryland-Baltimore Health Sciences and Human Services Library originated in 1813.  With an eye toward mastering the accelerated demands of the information future, the newly constructed Health Sciences and Human Services Library opened in 1998 in an unprecedented, multi-functional, comprehensive library/information services facility. It also serves as the Regional Medical Library for the Southeastern/Atlantic Region, one example of its close administrative ties to the NLM. The new Health Sciences and Human Services Library at the University of Maryland is one of the most sophisticated library/information technology centers in the countryit is also the largest medical library on the East Coast. The 190,000-square-foot building serves the University's health and human services professional campus, a specialized training ground for physicians, dentists, pharmacists, lawyers, and nurses.  A heavily computer-driven building, the new facility merges the traditional library with the Computer Science Department of the University.  Other components of the building include administrative offices, classrooms, computer laboratories, and demonstration rooms, as well as display and storage space for the University's collection of rare and historical medical books, and a large meeting and special events room.

The library currently stores over 7,300 cubic feet of NLM archival collections.  It offers secure underground storage space with archival quality compact shelving.  The space is climate controlled and access is limited to 3 full-time library staffers.  An environmental survey was conducted by NLM archives and modern manuscripts and preservation section staff and the facilities met or exceeded our specifications.  The library offers processing workspace within the storage area itself and a second fully equipped workstation within its general administrative office space.  The facility is managed by a full time library staffer who will be the main point of contact for the project officer.

<p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Service<br />Southeast Regional Office</p>
<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p>Network Operations Center (NOC) Air Conditioning System Purchase and Installation</p>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>This Statement of Work (SOW) is for the purchase and installation of a supplementary air conditioning system in the Network Operations Center (NOC) in the Southeast Regional Office (SERO) building of the NOAA Fisheries Service located at 263 13th Avenue South, Saint Petersburg, Florida 33701. This new system will be used to increase the air cooling capacity within the room as a supplement to existing air conditioning systems.</p>
<p>2. Problem Statement</p>
<p>The Network Operations Center (NOC) houses the network and computer servers used by the Southeast Regional Office. The NOC is currently cooled by two ceiling-mounted self-contained package system air conditioning (AC) units. The units are mounted above a drop ceiling in the NOC, and the heat from the units is dissipated with cool air that flows into the area above the drop ceiling from the main building AC. Although the total cooling capacity would probably be sufficient for the room, the current method of heat exchange (i.e., using the main building AC to cool the heat generated from the ceiling units) is inefficient. This method does not appear to provide adequate cooling of the exhaust heat due to the confined space within which the AC units are located, so the units are not able to adequately cool the room.</p>
<p>Due to this problem, the SERO wants to add a split-system precision air conditioning system into the room. The total cooling capacity of the new system should be 5 tons. Heating capability is not required. The air handler/evaporator will be installed above the drop ceiling in the NOC, in a suitable location to be determined in consultation between the contractor and the SERO project manager. The outdoor condensing unit will be located on the roof of the building. Note that the NOC is located in the middle of the second floor of the three-story building. The contractor will be responsible for determining the appropriate positioning for all equipment and the routing of all piping and wiring. The contractor will be responsible for installing all piping necessary between the indoor and outdoor portions of the system. The contractor will also be responsible for any and all roof sealing or repair associated with installing the system.</p>
<p>Note that the SERO office building is a leased facility, so the contractor will need to coordinate all work with the building management company. The details of all work outside of the NOC itself will be reviewed and approved in advance by the management company before the work can proceed. All completed work will be reviewed and approved by both the management company and the SERO project manager before the project will be accepted.</p>
<p>Bidders for this project must fully evaluate all information specified in this SOW and confirm to their satisfaction that the new AC system will function and perform as specified once installed. If bidders believe that any specifications are incorrect and that the system will not function or perform properly according to the specifications provided, these problems should be identified and submitted as questions during the Request For Quote (RFQ) solicitation process. Bidders should also submit questions during the solicitation process if they believe any designs are incomplete. The contractor for this RFQ will be fully and solely responsible for the proper functioning and performance of the AC system.</p>
<p><br />3. Task Elements</p>

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) through the Department of Health and Human Serivces, Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Sourcing, Division Acquisition Management intends to award a sole source cost reimbursable contract to Arlington County Fire Department(ACFD), Arlington, Virginia, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. ACFD unique in their capabilities to perform the required preparedness and readiness and is the only source that can satisfy the needs of the government. 

I.   Purpose

On January 1, 2007, The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) was transferred from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Office of Preparedness and Emergency Operations (OPEO). The services of the National Medical Response Team  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) team for the National Capital Region (NMRT-NCR) have been provided to the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) via a readiness cooperative agreement in past years. The services of this vital asset are requested through a new contract. The initial performance period of the contract will be 9 months, beginning on the date of award, and will include four 1-year option periods. 

Due to the location of the center of government in Washington, DC, NDMS, working with several Washington DC metropolitan area fire departments and the Council of Governments (COG), has developed a specialized medical response team specifically for use in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. NDMS designated this specialized team as the NMRT-NCR and assisted in developing this team as a WMD response unit to support the Federal response to a terrorism incident within the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Washington Metropolitan area is defined by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments as the National Capital Region, which is in turn defined as the following jurisdictions: The City of Alexandria, Arlington County, The District of Columbia, Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Montgomery County, Prince Georges County, Prince William County, and all included municipalities. The National Capital Region was created pursuant to the National Capital Planning Act of 1952 (Title 40, U.S.C., Sec. 71).

The mission of the NMRT-NCR, when activated, is to respond by providing mass or individual decontamination of victims within the National Capital Region contaminated by chemical, biological, or radiological agents; provide medical care and/or stabilization for these victims; assist in triage and treatment before and after decontamination; provide technical assistance to local EMS officials; and, pre-deploy when directed, as a result of a credible or potential terrorist threat.

OPEO/NDMS seeks to enter into a contract with the Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD), Arlington, VA.  The resulting contract will be for the readiness and preparedness of the NMRT-NCR.  This Statement of Work sets forth the requirements for the readiness and preparedness of team personnel, the storage of equipment and supplies, and the quality control, maintenance, exercise, and contingent deployment of supplies and specialized response equipment consistent with the mission of the NMRT-NCR. The NMRT-NCR shall be ready to deploy personnel and material for immediate use in responding to a WMD or mass casualty incident within the NCR.  The vehicles, products and other specialized materials and stored and maintained under this contract shall be known as the NMRT-NCR cache.  The exact location of this storage site shall be FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY and shall be referred to as the NMRT-NCR cache site.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>The wet well will not be replaced, and it hasn't been decided whether or not to re-coat it. Therefore, please submit a complete bid without inclusion of the re-coating, as well as a separate breakout of the additional work and costs associated with providing the re-coating.</p>

<DESC>NOTE:

BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:  This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations.  However, cost/price will contribute substantially to the selection decision.  

By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors.

The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:  

A.  Technical Acceptability.  Initially, the government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable.  Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically Unacceptable.  All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and past performance history.
  
The proposals shall be evaluated against the following subfactors:

1. Vendor Technically Acceptable
2. Past Performance
3. Best value to the government
4. Lowest Price

Limit proposal to 50 pages.  Direct all questions and submit proposal to marcelo.buckley@randolph.af.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6  STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Compact Manipulator and Cartesian Motion System (Linear Rail) to be used in the Intelligent Systems Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. ***

BACKGROUND
The Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) in the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL) has need for a compact, lightweight manipulator with at least six axes, a high payload, and the capability to move through about a 1 .5 cubic meter workspace. The Division also requires a Cartesian motion system (linear rail) that will be used to dynamically position the manipulator. The manipulator and rail must independently and simultaneously control arm and rail dynamic motions. The manipulator must be able to be mounted on the floor and the ceiling and on the linear rail. It must be able to move rapidly and must be able to repeatedly reach a position with 0.1 mm accuracy or better. The robot controller must be able to report accurate position information to an outside computer at a rate of at least 20 Hz. It must be able to interface with other devices using at least the Ethernet protocol and accept joint angles and Cartesian tool point input from external sources at a rate of at least 20 Hz. For the measurement project in which these devices will be used, it is necessary to be able to view the end of the robot arm (tool tip) with continuous line-of-sight from a highly accurate laser tracker.


***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s): 

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Lot, 
Compact Manipulator and Cartesian Motion System (Linear Rail)

Contractor shall meet or exceed the following minimum required technical specifications:

Specifications for Compact Manipulator
At least 6 axes of motion
Maximum Reach: Not less than 1.5 m
Payload: greater than or equal to 20 kg nominal
Repeatability: less than or equal to 0.1 mm
Speed: Maximum Cartesian speed of the tool point should be no less than 1.5 m/s (3.0 m/s preferable)
 over at least 80% of the work volume.
Weight: Low enough for the linear rail to be able to move the manipulator accurately at 3 ms/s or better.

Specifications for the Linear Rail
The rail system must include:
 At least 3.5 m stroke
 At least 4 m rail length
 Approx. 3m/s or higher maximum linear speed
 Repeatability of plus/minus 0.15 mm or better
 Rail height with the robot base plate mounted approximately 3 m above the floor on support stands that are bolted to the concrete floor. 

Combined Specifications:

 The robot arm must be mounted either 1) upside down (underslung) on the rail carriage or 2) mounted with the manipulator on top of the rail where in case 2, the rail must be mounted approximately 1 m above the floor.  In either configuration (underslung or floor mount), the manipulator must include a base-rotation joint (i.e., 6 manipulator axes plus 1 linear rail axis of motion).
 The linear rail and the manipulator must be able to operate independently. That is, the manipulator must be able to move without the linear rail motion and the linear rail must be able to move without manipulator motion. Also, the manipulator must be easily removed from the rail (e.g., unbolted and electrically disconnected) and the rail must still be able to be controlled (e.g., move the rail table (robot base mount) along the rail). The rail table should support mounting of other devices or fixtures (e.g., brackets) as well as the manipulator.
 The linear rail and the manipulator must also be able to operate as an integrated system where both rail and manipulator are controlled simultaneously and time synchronized. 
 All service and installation manuals for both systems must be provided.
 Electrical: both systems must support 480Vac w/wall plug, drive amplifier, controller


***The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, a twelve (12) month warranty for the instrumentation. The warranty must cover parts and travel/labor for on-site repairs under the warranty period*** 

***Delivery shall be completed not later than 90 days after receipt of an order and shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. ***

*** Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

1. Visual and Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
2. Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications. The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor. At a minimum, NIST will test to ensure the maximum specified speed and accuracy requirements are met and the required manipulator and rail motions are reached while carrying the rated maximum load and at the manipulator's greatest rated extension.


****The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, 3) Previous Experience, and 4) Price. Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Previous Experience, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to Price. 

****Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quotations shall include the make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature, which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product(s) meet or exceed the specifications stated above. 

****Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service, provided by the Contractor. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/ or information provided by NIST or its affiliates. Quoters shall provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar products have been sold. The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed. 

***Past Experience shall be evaluated to determine the extent of the Contractor's experience of at least five (5) years in and knowledge in providing similar instrumentation. System shall have previously demonstrated long term ruggedness, durability and consistency. Evaluation of past experience may be based on contacts used for past performance; however, the vendor should provide additional references relating to its past experience information, if necessary. To allow assessment, each quote must include appropriate documentation. 


***The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

THIS NOTICE IS AMENDED TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:
A design that is scalable, reconfigurable and provides an open architecture. An open architecture is characterized as utilizing well-established, non-proprietary standards for interfaces, services, software, and supporting formats. Kindly provide more detailed information as to your definition of open architecture. Are you saying that you can plug any device or instrument into our system and expect it to function. What are these well-established, non-proprietary standards ?
The government does not want a system that can not grow as technology changes or parts need replacing, nor do they want to be locked into vendor proprietary software. For example, if a component/card fails, the government wants to be able to replace this part without having to go back to the vendor for maintenance support. It is expected that a standard interface like USB would be able to be plugged into your system and it will be recognized.

(2) A modular connector and multibus switching architecture, covering at least 100 channels, that supports the use of one-to-one universal adapter cables which do not need to be dedicated to a specific assembly or system, this would require applying the multibus signals without having to breakout parallel lines from the universal adapter cables. We require more details with regard to the  universal adapter , Who defines that adapter ? What is the definition of this adapter as well as its operating environment ?
A universal adapter is an interface cable / module which adapts the tester connector to the UUT connector with one (contact)-to-one (contact) connectivity.  When using an automatic wiring tester, the tester feature which makes this adapter truly universal is multibus switching.  When both test and excitation connections can be made to each or predetermined set of contact(s) in the adapter, then it can truly be called universal.  That is because ALL cables / relay boxes / switch panels utilizing that connector can be tested without modification to the adapter (i.e. without breakout or Y-off). 

(3) Generating and viewing real time schematics diagrams of the harness under test; If schematics are to begenerated real time ( during the test process ), who generates the layers for the .dxf file ?
Government is not sure what is meant by layers of .dxf file. The harness under test can be learned first by the tester and then the schematic can be generated. 

(4) Where ONE power supply, is programmed with ONE output level, then that ONE output is available and selectable by any or all 100 test channels?  OR Is there a different operating scenario?
There needs to be only one power supply.  A voltage will be selected and the sequential stepping will start and that voltage applied whenever the test program call for it.  An additional scenario should be accommodated where different voltages are needed during the course of the program.  Here, the stepping can be paused while the new voltage is called for, and then continue stepping.  Only one voltage will be required at any one time.  

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS ADDED TO PARAGRAPH (7) IN THE STATEMENT OF WORK:

(7) Programmable power supply (0-30VDC, 5 Amp minimum) available to multibus switching for stimulus power for test article components. There needs to be only one power supply.  A voltage will be selected and the sequential stepping will start and that voltage applied whenever the test program call for it.  An additional scenario should be accommodated where different voltages are needed during the course of the program.  Here, the stepping can be paused while the new voltage is called for, and then continue stepping.  Only one voltage will be required at any one time. 


THIS SOLICITATION/SYNOPSIS CLOSING DATE IS HEREBY EXTENDED INDEFINITELY.

<DESC>Mission and Installation Contracting Command, MICC/ITEC4 intends to negotiate a sole source, firm fixed price contract with Interindustry Economic Research Funds (IERF), Inc. College Park, Maryland.  This acquisition is a follow on to W91QUZ-07-P-0041.

The purpose of this requirement will be to take the defense demands allocated by industry and location, and to incorporate these into a macroeconomic input-output model that allocates direct expenditures, indirect expenditures, and employment by state, industry, and occupation resulting in an economic report for Congress.  The following requirements apply:  Government retains all data rights. Results must be in a non-proprietary format, provide ability to run desktop simulations/variations for policy analysis, ability to handle data in NAICS classification, US Macroeconomic forecast must be consistent with those available commercially, Input-Output matrix underlying macro forecast must contain enough resolution to allocate defense demands across all relevant industrial sectors, provide data that are filtered, screened, and virus free, and data must be ODBC complaint.

This contractor is uniquely qualified because of its economic forecasting models previously developed, implemented and currently used. This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. It is PA&E/OSD 's belief that IERF Inc. is the only source qualified to meet this need, in that other sources could not provide comparable historical data pr expertise specifically tailored to PA&E/OSDs needs without substantially increased costs to the Government to replace and supplement software models that IERF Inc. currently provides to PA&E/OSD. MICC/ITEC4 will not issue a solicitation. MICC/ITEC4 will not respond to requests for solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement. Responses must provide sufficient information for PA&E/OSD to determine that a firm other than IERF Inc. can provide the Economic forecasting publication as described above. If MICC/ITEC4 does not receive an acceptable response to this announcement within 15 days of its publication, it will proceed as stated herein. See Numbered Note #22, substituting (per FAR 5.203(a) and 12.204(b)) a response time of 15 days for this acquisition of a commercial item for the forty-five day response time appearing in the note. The Government will consider all responses but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely at the discretion of the Government. This requirement will be procured utilizing procedures in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items. This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, but merely notification of the Government's intent to award this economic forecasting report to IERF Inc . Requests for copies of a solicitation in response hereto will not be honored or acknowledged. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purposes of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this publication. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. If no affirmative, responses are received within 15 business days, negotiations will be conducted with IERF, Inc. as the only source and an award will be issued without any additional notices being posted. Capability Statements should be submitted NLT 12:00 noon on 22 August 2008.<BR>

The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract with an estimated award date of October 1, 2008.

We are soliciting for (24) copy machines on a leasing agreement.  Please provide us with a flat rate of a cost per copy for the maintenance agreement for each machine.  This costs should also include any leasing costs we will be required to pay.  Also, please confirm the agreement will include all repairs, supplies, such as toner, etc. and what other items are included.  The standard contract is inclusive with the exception of staples and paper.  Please confirm this in your bid.

If there is an allowance of copies per month, please provide us with this figure.  If this figure is reached for all (24) copiers per month, please provide the overage cost per copy even if it is the same amount of the original cost per copy.

If your company does receive the award of the contract, you will receive a listing of each location with a contact name and extension number in order for meter readings to be obtained.

As for repair calls, there will be a requirement of a (48) hour turn around after the repair call has been made.  THERE IS ALSO A REQUIREMENT OF TWO (2) TECHNICIANS, AT A MINIMUM, TO REPAIR MACHINES; THEREFORE, NO DOWN TIME SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED WHEN PLACING REPAIR CALLS.  The names of the technicians must be provided at the time of the submission of your bid.  Only one (1) repairman is needed per repair.

You will be required to state any involved cost should a decision be made to use this option in the future.

<DESC>The FDA is issuing the subject Request for Proposals (RFP) to provide non-clinical and clinical studies to assess the effects of anesthetics and sedatives on the developing human brain, including long-term studies in neonates and young children, as well as overarching coordination and program management activities, in furtherance of the Safety of Key Inhaled and Intravenous Drugs in Pediatrics (SAFEKIDS) Initiative.

FDAs mission is to protect the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nations food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation.  FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by fostering innovations that make medical products more safe, effective, and affordable.  As part of its goal of fostering innovation, FDA seeks to identify and address those scientific and technical obstacles to the optimum development of safe and therapeutically important medical products.  A key aspect of the Agencys mission is to identify, and help address, potential safety concerns associated with all products under its jurisdiction and this includes the use of anesthetics and sedatives in pediatric patients.

Non-clinical studies in juvenile animal models have shown that exposure to some anesthetics and sedatives is associated with neurodegenerative changes in the central nervous system, as well as memory and learning deficits.  Anesthetic agents that have been specifically implicated are NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, and GABA agonists, such as sevoflurane.  The anesthesia community and the FDA acknowledge that there are insufficient human data to either support or refute the clinical relevance of these findings for pediatric patients.  Therefore, additional non-clinical and clinical studies will be needed to assess the effect of anesthetics and sedatives on the developing human brain, including long-term studies in neonates and young children.

The SAFEKIDS Initiative is a new requirement and will be a multi-phased, multi-year effort; however, the subject synopsis is expected to encompass only the initial phase of the overall initiative.  FDA is soliciting proposals from entities capable of completing one or more of the following tasks/studies:

(1)  Assessment of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in pediatric patients administered regional or general anesthesia as neonates or infants;

(2)  Assessment of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and short- and long-term neurotoxic effects of an anesthetic in infants undergoing various surgical procedures;

(3)  Assessment of the effects of anesthetic exposure on neurocognitive, emotional and behavioral outcomes;

(4)  Assessment of long-term cognitive development following general anesthesia as an infant;

(5)  Evaluation of mechanisms of and potential prevention of neurotoxicity after administration of an inhalation anesthetic in an animal model; and

(6)  Development of an administrative and scientific infrastructure to support the creation and execution of a series of projects under the SAFEKIDS Initiative

The period of performance for each individual task order listed above will be approximately 26 months from date of award.  Planning and performing studies to address the aforementioned issues will involve enormous challenges in terms of design, assurance of validity and reliability of the outcome measures, and ethical considerations.  The services will be provided under a  Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Contract.  There is no predetermined number of awardees:  More than one individual project may be awarded to a single deserving entity.

This is a Full and Open competitive requirement:  Not as a set-aside for any specific class of business concern and (2) utilizing the procurement methods proscribed in FAR Part 15  Contracting by Negotiation.  The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor will be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.


The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is:  541690  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services (Small Business Size:  $6.5M).  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).


This announcement is an active RFP.  The proposal due date is September 8, 2008, at 1:00PM, Eastern Time.  The anticipated award date for this effort is expected to be on or around September 19, 2008.

<DESC>This Modification is a clarification of specs due to several vendor questions:
The deck height is not 60" it is 25 1/4" (60x120 trailer). 8 pneumatic tires on the 60" x 144" would not give us a 10K lbs. rating so we are requesting 4 "solid pneumatics". Vendors would be correct in assuming to make two 72" racks on the 144" trailer. Both trailer types will have two removable racks on which span the full length of each side of the trailer.
The trailers have no suspension, axles are mounted solid. The parking brake is mechanical. The solid pneumatic tire is an extra thick rubber, air filled tire.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) to award a contract for the Long Branch Beach renourishment project. This project will include the dredging of sand from the designated Sea Bright Borrow Area, located off Sandy Hook, NJ. The Sea Bright Borrow Area is located approximately five miles off shore at a mean water depth of 75 feet. The material (beach fill) will be placed north of Lake Takanassee. There will be 500,000 CY to 1,000,000 CY taken from the Sea Bright Borrow Area for Long Branch Beach renourishment project.<br /><br />The Contractor will be required to prepare and submit a site-specific unexplored ordnance (UXO) operational work plan to the government for approval prior to dredging operations. The Contractors proposed methodology of performing a magnetometer search and ordnance removal will be required as part of the work plan.<br /><br />The Contractor will also be required to conduct Sea Turtle and Whale monitoring during the period of June 15th through November 15th. The Contractor cannot place beach fill material during the period of March 15th through September 15th due to Piper Plovers nesting on the beach. There are additional restrictions to beach fill placement during the period of May 1st to November 1st. These restrictions are to avoid disturbance to bird nesting from Sea Beach Amaranth and Terns.<br /><br />This procurement is being solicited as UNRESTRICTED, full and open competition to all business concerns. The applicable NAICS CODE is 237990. The small business size is $18,500,000. The SIC Code is 1629, Heavy Construction, not elsewhere classified. The estimated construction cost is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. Small Business Goals: If a large business, the prime contractor shall provide its small business subcontracting plan conforming to the requirements of FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.7. The small business goals are as follows: Small Business 70.0%, Small Disadvantaged Business 6.5%, HUBzone Small Business 9.8%, Women-Owned Small Business 7.5%, Veteran-Owned Small Business 4.0%, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 2.0%. A subcontracting plan reflecting goals less than indicated shall provide, as part of the subcontracting plan submission, those extenuating circumstances of why the goal can not be met. You may contact the District, the deputy Small Business advocate, or your local SBA for assistance. A contract will not be awarded until the Contracting Officer has determined that the subcontracting plan provides maximum practicable opportunities for Small, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, and Women-Owned Small Business program concerns to participate in contract performance. The selected contractor will be required to commence work within 5 calendar days after the date the Contractor receives the Notice to Proceed, prosecute the work diligently, and complete the work no later than 730 calendar days for the entire project, after the date the Contractor receives the Notice to Proceed. The time stated for completion shall include final cleanup of the premises. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires that Past Performance Information (PPI) be collected on Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. The Government has now implemented a web-enabled application that collects and manages contractor past performance data. Effective 1 April 2007, the system, CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (CPARS), requires both the contractor and the Government to submit their portion of the CPARS report via the internet for Construction contracts in excess of $100,000.00. More definitive guidance and instructions will be incorporated in the solicitation and resultant contract. In the meantime, to become familiar with the system, the CPARS website has a computer-based training module and a practice session for your use at https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/ct/I/home.asp by following the links to the Training. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 11 July 2008 with bid opening on/about 11 August 2008.
