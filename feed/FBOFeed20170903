Please see Specifications, JOFOC and Trade-in form further information. This equipment will greatly facilitate many ongoing projects and also provide a wealth of collaboration opportunities both within NIDCD. The Leica EM ICE is the state of the art high-pressure freezer, providing better freezing parameters than previous high pressure freezers, including our current Leica HPM 100 while also incorporating timed light and electrical stimulation to capture important biological events. Our previous high-pressure freezer, a Leica HPM 100 was not capable of freezing auditory tissue without ice crystal artifacts, the improved freezing in the EM ICE is expected to greatly improve these preparations. <br /><br />Responses

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD201700032 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541380 and the business size standard is 1000 employees. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to contract on a sole source basis with University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware Street, SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, for the services of Kidney Biopsy Processing, Imaging, and Morphometric Measurements.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tasks to be performed</strong></span><br />1. Processing<br />A. Embed kidney tissue in paraffin and EPON according to protocol.<br />2. Light microscopy<br />a. Cut and stain an adequate number of semi-thin (0.5-1.0 micron) sections to provide the light microscopic images described below and the electron microscopic images described in #2.<br />b. Imaging:<br />40X: 2 randomly chosen fields/section (on at least 6 sections) for detennination of fractional interstitial area<br />5X: photo montage of each thick section in its entirety to provide images (profiles) of 15-20 glomeruli per patient for detennination of glomerular area<br />3. Transmission electron microscopy<br />A. From 0.5-1micron sections stained with toluidine blue, randomly choose 3 glomeruli that are intact, not distorted and not globally sclerotic. Choose among the center-most glomeruli, or the ones least affected by mechanical artifact. Trim the block for transmission electron microscopy, cut (gold to silver, 60-90 nm) and stain (lead citrate, uranyl acetate) ultra-thin sections to be imaged as below.<br />B. Digital Imaging:<br />3000X: photomontage of3 complete glomerular profiles (25-30 fields/glomerulus)<br />12000X: 20 systematically uniformly sampled images of the glomerular capillary<br />wall per glomerulus (total of 60 images)- e.g. every 7111 "frame" from topto-<br />bottom, left-to-right (moving one frame further, if the 7111 frame does not<br />contain capillary wall)<br />4. Measurements by light microscopy<br />A. Cortical fractional volume of interstitial [Vv(int/cortex)] and atrophic tubules/total<br />tubules. (Vv(AT/TT)].<br />B. Glomerular volume by Weibel Gomez method and arteriolar hyalinosis index (IAH).<br />C. Percent global glomerular sclerosis.<br />5. Measurements by electron microscopy<br />A. Classical Diabetic Glomerulopathy Parameters: GBM width, mesangial fractional<br />volume [Vv(Mes/glom)], mesangial matrix fractional volume [Vv(MM/glom)],<br />mesangial cell fractional volume [Vv(MC/glom)], and filtration surface density<br />[Sv(PGBM/glom)], will be obtained using unbiased and validated methods used for<br />all other biopsies in this protocol.<br />B. Foot Process Width (FPW): Mean FPW will be estimated on peripheral GBM as the reciprocal of filtration slit length density [Ls(SP/GBM)] on peripheral GBM on<br />35,000 X images.<br />C. Podocyte Detachment from GBM and endothelial fenestration on the peripheral<br />capillary luminal surface will be estimated using a line intercept counting method.  <br />D. Podocyte number: MPSI, a modification of the original point-sampled intercept (OPSI) method, is an unbiased, efficient, shape-independent method for estimating particle size. We changed the Sampling strategy to reduce the volume-weighted property ofOPSI. Now all nuclear profiles (as opposed to only those sampled by a point grid in OPSI) are included and each nucleus receives only one set of intercept measurements through a random point (as opposed to multiple measurements if a nucleus is hit by multiple points in OPSI). Montage images of complete glomerular profiles will be prepared. Podocyte nuclei will be identified and numbered. A point/lattice grid with points 21 &mu;m apart will be super-imposed on the images. This grid has enough point density to have at least one-point fall on every podocyte nucleus. On each podocyte nucleus, one point will be randomly selected using a random number generator. An intercept line will be passed through this sampling point in two perpendicular directions. Nuclear diameter along the intercept lines will be measured according to OPSI using the Adobe Photoshop measuring tool.<br /><br />To ensure valid comparisons across biopsies, all need to be processed and measured by the same method and in the same laboratories by the same personnel.<br /><br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition.

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.
