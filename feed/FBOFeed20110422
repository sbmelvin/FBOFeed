<DESC>Apr 2011<br />MEMORANDUM FOR: ALL RENEWABLE ENERGY CONTRACTORS AND INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS<br />FROM: Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency<br />SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) for Air Force Renewable Energy Programs involving proven Small Solar (750kW) Energy Technologies<br />Description<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes. The Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency is seeking cost and capability information from interested parties concerning the matters described below for application at bases across the Air Force. The Air Force has taken steps to access potential available Solar (1 MW) resources for PV electricity generation at or about Air Force military installations for a small number of sites. That data was assembled from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) database and RETScreen&reg; International, a project analysis software package developed by Natural Resources Canada.<br />A cursory look at previous Air Force Solar PV studies data for 1 MW indicates that there may be opportunities for capturing small Renewable Solar PV energy (&lt;750 kW). These may yield business developments attractive for meeting Air Force Energy Goals. For 1 MW electrical energy generation, a number sites appear to be located near: Creech AFB, NV, Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ, Nellis AFB, NV, Tonopah Auxillary Airfield Annex, NV, Luke AFB, NV, Kirtland AFB, NM, Cannon AFB, NM, and, Los Angeles AFB, CA. <br />PV Module and System Specifications<br />Parameter PV System<br />Module Mounting Latitude-Tilted, Ground-Mounted Single-axis Tracking, Ground-Mounted Roof-Mounted Roof-Mounted<br />Module Material Monocrystalline Silicone Monocrystalline Silicone Monocrystalline Silicone Cadmium Telluride<br />System Size 1 MW 1 MW 1 MW 0.6 MW<br />Module Efficiency 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 10.8%<br />Temperature Coefficient 0.40%/oC 0.40%/oC 0.40%/oC 0.24%/oC<br />Inverter Efficiency 90% 90% 90% 90%
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this Small Solar (750kW) RFI is twofold: first to identify market viable partnership concepts, from strategies to specific projects, to create and grow long-term public-private partnerships to develop renewable energy projects on Air Force installations in the continental United States, Hawaii and Alaska; and second, to identify qualified private sector developers, utilities, and/or like development entities with an interest in developing renewable energy projects on Air Force land. The objectives of this RFI are derived from a broad set of Air Force energy goals and operational cost savings mandates. They include, but are not limited to:<br />&#61607; Reduce Demand: The Air Force is committed to reducing installation energy demand. <br />&#61607; Increase Supply: The Air Force is committed to increasing energy supplies, utilizing renewable and alternative energy where possible, to enhance energy security and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Air Force goal is that 25% of all facility energy be from renewable sources by Fiscal Year 2025.<br />&#61607; Cost Avoidance: The Air Force is mandated to reduce or eliminate operations costs for the repair, replacement, and/or investment in energy generation infrastructure.<br />&#61607; Revenue Generation: Air Force asset management strategy seeks to optimize non-excess assets through the development of renewable energy projects, where mutually beneficial to the Air Force, external installation community, and private developers.<br />The mechanisms to implement public-private partnerships utilized by the Air Force to achieve these objectives can take many forms. Development concepts can include, but are not limited to:<br />&#61607; Renewable Energy Power Purchase Agreement (REPPA). Under the authority of 10 USC 2304 and 40 USC 113(e)(3), the Air Force purchases power from on-base renewable energy generation projects. Project size is determined by installation demand. The Air Force is the power offtaker. Solicitation is accomplished via a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>&#61607; Enhanced Use Lease (EUL). Under the authority of 10 USC &sect; 2667, the Air Force leases land to a developer, utility, or other entity to develop a renewable energy project on an installation for which the market is the power offtaker. Project size is determined by market demand and installation renewable resources, possibly augmented by surrounding community resources. Solicitation is accomplished via a Request for Qualifications (RFQ).</p>
<p>&#61607; EUL/PPA Combination. This project type is in a concept development phase at this time. An EUL/PPA maximizes the market potential of an EUL with the benefit of the Air Force being a limited offtaker of the power produced via a power purchase agreement. Each vehicle is mandated under separate authority as listed above under EUL and PPA respectively. Solicitation process to be determined.<br />&#61607; Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC). Under the authority of 10 CFR 436 Subpart B, the Air Force may enter into shared-energy savings contracts with private-sector energy service companies (ESCOs) to increase the energy efficiency at a facility. The ESCO designs and constructs a project that meets the agency's needs and arranges the necessary financing. The ESCO guarantees that the improvements will generate energy cost savings sufficient to pay for the project over the term of the contract. ESCO funded improvements are paid through a share of the savings resulting from the energy efficiency. Solicitation is accomplished via a RFP.</p>
<p>&#61607; Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESC). Under the authority of 10 USC Section 2913, the Air Force participates in utility energy efficiency programs. In a UESC, a utility arranges financing to cover the capital costs of the project, which are repaid over the contract term from cost savings generated by the energy efficiency measures. Solicitation is accomplished via a RFP.</p>
<p>&#61607; Other. The Air Force is open to any new and innovative strategies and project concepts which can help the Air Force to meet its energy goals and operational cost savings mandates. <br />Based on the Air Force's energy goals and objectives, and its unique non-excess asset portfolio in or adjacent to markets with significant renewable energy development and or potential, we believe there is a unique opportunity for market makers to partner with the Air Force to create value for all--a win-win business proposition.<br />Industry Engagement <br />This interaction with Industry organizations has been initiated following the AF Renewable Energy Industry Day held in Irving, TX on 8 December 2010. A series of RFIs to gain additional specific input will be focused on separate areas of the renewable energy spectrum. This RFI is focused on Small Solar (750kW). With distributed generation, the energy produced would first be used in the host building or area. Responses on these topics may be presented in combination or in separate concepts. <br />Future RFIs, covering different focus areas, will be posted to FedBizOps.gov in approximately two week intervals to allow control of the RFI review and evaluation workload. General planning is to move through Focus Areas in the following order, subject to adjustment and change. <br />Large Wind (&gt;500 kW)<br />Woody Biomass<br />Large Solar (&gt;750 kW)<br />WTE with Municipal Solid Waste<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Responses</span><br />Please include in your response to this Request for Information, detailed responses to the following areas:<br /><br />a.

<DESC>Self-decontaminating membranes for chemical protective garment applications are required for technology demonstration efforts at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC).  Based upon prior work conducted by industry and by the NSRDEC in 2009-2010, new reactive membranes are sought for a limited production run to provide 50 yards of self-detoxifying membrane for use in a new garment concept by the NSRDEC.   There are a limited number of companies with this technology and production capability, and the purpose of this RFI is to determine the extent of the capabilities that expert industry in the field of chemical protective fabric production can offer.<br><br>The Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), and more specifically Warfighter Science Technology and Applied Research Directorate (WARSTAR) has an acquisition requirement of 50 yards of 50 inch wide coated expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) or ePTFE membrane.  The coating is specified to be a polymer capable of reacting with chemical warfare agents at a humidity of at least 80% r.h., and coated onto the ePTFE substrate within a thickness of 50-100 microns.  Additionally, the Government expects that specialized additives in the coating could be proposed to enhance softness, polymer humidification and reaction rates.  These additional features will be determined by the Government after testing samples of membrane provided by the performer prior to a final full scale process run.  For purposes of this RFI, sources must be able to:  (1) demonstrate destruction of chemical warfare agent simulants with proposed membrane compositions (2) demonstrate that a thin, uniform and flexible membrane will result from the proposed material coating process, (3) demonstrate adherence to contract schedule, milestone, and delivery requirements, and (4) provide efficient and effective cost control.  The contractor's primary focus shall be to manufacture 50 yards of coated ePTFE membrane according to the Government's specified composition, including adequate thickness and uniformity.  <br><br>This RFI is solely for information purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any information submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such information.<br><br>Any information/samples submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such samples.  Responses to this notice are to be sent to Dr. Heidi Schreuder-Gibson , ATTN: RDNS-WSC-C, 15 Kansas St., Natick, MA 01760-5020.  This notice is for market survey only.

The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, transportation, lodging, equipment, and other items required to conduct UXO safety escorts at Fort Bragg, NC.

The UXO safety escort ensures safety during the transit of persons being escorted by detecting unexploded ordnance in the immediate path of the escorted party, and redirecting the party as necessary to avoid unexploded ordnance and other hazards. The escort function involves hazard recognition and avoidance not the execution of UXO search or clearance actions. <br>	Award will be made to the contractor who meets the skill and educational requirements as provided in the Statement of Work and whose past performance and price represent best overall value to the government. Acceptable past performance will be based on evidence that the contractor has satisfactorily completed the same work or similar as described on work statement. Estimates for this contract will be for the maximum quantity of work but payment will be based on services provided on a per escort per day basis. <br>	The period of performance of any contract resulting from this solicitation utilizing safety escorts, shall begin on or about 10 May 2011 and end 30 August 2011. NAICS code is 541620 and size standard is $7.0 million.

<DESC>Recent advances in SiGe/BiCMOS integrated circuit technology have shown promise for executing limited phased array capabilities at frequencies up to 94 GHz. Noise Figures (NF) and Power Amplifier (PA) efficiencies have been demonstrated that are suitable for low power applications when antenna gains are low. Numerous military sensor concepts require high antenna gain but only moderate radiated power in addition to an ability to rapidly scan in two dimensions. This requirement results in a need for circuits which have significant control capability per channel, yet small radiated power per element. The goal of this effort would be the demonstration of a silicon-based tile array that would form a building block for Extremely High Frequency (EHF) electronically scanned arrays with large numbers of elements. A particular challenge may be executing the phased array RF control functions while maintaining acceptable tile level power added efficiency for low transmitter powers.<br />

<CONTACT>BAA Coordinator, Email DARPA-BAA-11-53@darpa.mil
<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to develop flexible / robust energy storage systems<br />for forward operating bases (FOBs) that can utilize energy from a variety of traditional and renewable<br />energy generation systems to provide the FOB an uninterrupted power supply with millisecond to<br />multiple day power interruptions or during extended periods of limited availability of primary energy<br />supplies. The goal of the Deployed Energy Storage (DES) program is to develop a deployable system to<br />enable maximum use of renewable energy sources in order to minimize the fuel required at FOBs for<br />power generation. As renewable energy sources exhibit intermittencies that span from milliseconds to<br />days, achieving the DES vision is anticipated to require significant technology developments that<br />include the following: 1) advances in the specific energy of short-term energy storage devices; 2) scale<br />up of short-term energy devices to MWh scale; 3) specific energy and round trip efficiency advances in<br />long-term energy storage devices; and 4) improvements in intelligent system control and power<br />distribution. DARPA intends to leverage existing investments in intelligent microgrid technology.<br />Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in<br />science, devices, or systems. Specially excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary<br />improvements to the existing state of practice. See attached DARPA-BAA-11-53 for full solicitation.</p>

<DESC>***ESTIMATED ISSUE DATE OF SOLICITATION electronically in FBO is May 6, 2011***<br />The intent of this solicitation is to provide services, equipment, and labor necessary for maintaining or restoring animal populations that need meadow habitat on the Central Coast Ranger District - Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. The primary focus of treatments is controlling unwanted vegetation in or adjacent to meadows. Unwanted vegetation includes but is not limited to non-native grasses, fern, blackberry, shrubs, and small trees. Portions of some meadows are steep and will require good traction to complete treatments.<br />Treatment methods vary depending on type of vegetation to be removed and the ability to access sites with machinery. Treatment methods can include machine mowing, machine mulching, and hand work. Machine mowing is generally used where machinery has access and the unwanted vegetation can be treated with a mower (grass and small shrubs, blackberry, trees, etc.).

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)-Cellular Neurophysiology Unit intends to negotiate, on a non-competitive basis and award to Technical Manufacturing Corporation, 15 Centennial Drive, Peabody, MA, 01960-7993 for a STACIS iX laser table vibration isolation system.   The STACIS iX active vibration isolation system will be critical for constructing an imaging/electrophysiology system that is free of mechanical vibrations. The Cellular Neurophysiology Unit at NINDS conducts research focused on the ionic mechanism of action potential firing and the excitability of neurons in the reward system.  The STACIS iX laser table-base system will enhance the researchers ability to perform sensitive imaging experiments by dramatically reducing mechanical vibrations, which can blur optical images.  In addition, this table will provide stable recording conditions that are necessary for electrophysiological recordings from fine processes or long-term recordings.  A number of these experiments will examine the contribution of ion channels located in axons and dendrites to neuronal excitability.  In order to perform these experiments, NINDS is constructing a two-photon laser scanning system that will allow imaging of neuronal processes in deep-tissue.  These imaging experiments require maximal isolation from mechanical vibrations that may be transmitted mainly through the floor of the building. The STACIS iX system is needed to conduct sensitive electrophysiology and two-photon imaging experiments.  The table is designed especially for active vibration isolation which will be used to dampen substantially low-frequency vibrations.

Technical Manufacturing Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the STACIS iX laser table vibration isolation system.  This system is a two-stage isolation system designed especially for active vibration isolation at both high and low-frequencies.  It is the most advanced active vibration cancellation system for optical tables that is commercially available.  Since vibrations, especially low frequency vibrations, can interface with image collection and limit the duration of healthy recordings, it is imperative to use this table.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR Part 12 procedures and exempt from the requirement of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 2054545, may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2080 and Attention: Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist or email to Snoddyj@mail.nih.gov .

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVICP Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.
  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps or by calling the NAVICP PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>HOBO Remote Monitoring SystemThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to award a brand name sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)), Simplified Acquisition Procedures for a HOBO Remote Monitoring System. We have a requirement for a number of different components that encompass the HOBO Remote Monitoring System. The HOBO Remote Monitoring System is a remote data logging and monitoring device with built in cellular communications that can be easily reconfigured and adapted to measure a wide variety of applications to measure climate. Up to 15 channels of data can be recorded and monitored remotely via Onset's web-enabled software platform, HOBOlink. All of the additional components listed provide the ability to measure specific parameters such as soil moisture, relative humidity, solar radiation, rainfall, temperature, barometric pressure, etc. The HOBO Remote Monitoring System unit has the capabilities, data logging storage capacity, and remote data upload to perform at the level desired for this field work. Due to the nature of the study, it is extremely important that there be consistency in the method in which our data is collected. We currently have about 30 other weather stations made by the same manufacturer out in the field. The use of a system made by the same manufacturer is imperative for data integrity and comparison. Using different brand weather stations would make the data collected inconsistent with each other, jeopardizing the entire project.We need multiple weather stations that have the capacity to measure and record soil moisture, relative humidity, solar radiation, rainfall, barometric pressure, as well as multiple temperatures, including air and soil temperature at various heights above and below the ground. In addition, each weather station must have USB connectivity for downloading data to handheld storage devices, and must have local data storage memory of at least 512 K bytes. Each system should be able to log data on at least 15 channels at five-second intervals. Each system must be easily reconfigurable with plug and play style sensors so that any sensor can be swapped out for a different parameter without any reprogramming needed. We also require some of the weather stations to have built in wireless communications through GSM cellular networks to online servers that are maintained by the weather station vendor. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USGS requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency (FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii)). All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Zachary Buss, at zbuss@usgs.gov. This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-51, Effective 15 April 2011.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334519 (Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing). SBA Size Standard in employees: 500The requirement will be unrestricted to business size.

<DESC>Request for Information/Notice to Sole Source VA-701-11-RI- 0148

Online Subscription - APIC

 Introduction:
The Department of Veterans Affairs - PCAC intends to issue a sole source contract to APIC Text On-line for site licenses to APIC Online Text of Infection Control and Epidemiology.  

Justfication: 
 That VHA National Infectious Diseases Program Office has identified this resource as an authoritative, uptodate, and relevant to the needs of ensuring infection control information made available for patient care.

At this time there is no solicitation. If your company feels it can provide the requirements of the online subscription please review the requirements and provide a capability statement.  

 Background: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires an existing commercial off the shelf web based, APIC Text of Infection Control and Epidemiology Product that will be made available throughout the VHA healthcare system.  
For the purpose of this solicitation, these products may also be referred to as bedside information tools because they have been designed to provide information at the patient's bedside or point of care.  They tend to provide information that will directly affect patient care. They can be a good source for background information. What distinguishes these products from sources such as electronic textbooks or bibliographic citations databases that may link to full text is this emphasis on point-of-care, patient-oriented information. These products are distinctly different from text-based, point-of-care sources such as printed guidelines: these electronic resources are updated much more frequently than print resources and provide tools for easily searching and sharing information.
Currently most VA Medical Centers and/or VISNs (Veterans Integrated Services Networks) license at least one Online APIC Text of Infection Control and Epidemiology product, but there is no one product available to all VHA staff on an enterprise basis.  VHA's goal is to insure uniform availability of a high quality, clinical, knowledge based resource across the VHA system to improve clinical decision making at the point of care.

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)<br />The United States Air Force, ASC/PKOB, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking potential sources to provide one (1) 2D Tomography System for delivery to AFIT/ENY (Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio). Lacking technically acceptable, competitive sources of supply, the Government currently intends to solicit only one source. Firms responding should specify their products which meet the technical specifications provided below and provide detailed product information to show clear technical compliance. Additionally, sales history including recent commercial companies sold to should be included to determine commerciality. The requirement specifications are as follows:
<p>The requested system includes the construction of a 2D grid system for tomographic reconstruction of the flow field of a combustor using 18 diode laser sensors. The sensor system will make temperature and H2O concentration measurements at 81 grid points. A tomographic reconstruction software will be provided. The 2-D grid system will be constructed by arranging the 18 Time Division Multiplexor sensors covering the flow field. The measurements will be performed at a rate of 30 kHz so temporal evolution of the 2-D temperature-field can be captured on a real-time basis. This hyper spectral sensor system along with the tomographic reconstruction model will allow capturing the dominant spatial and temporal instability modes in the combustors along with their interaction and spatio-temporal evolution providing both a research capability as well as a real-time diagnostic for deployed systems. The vendor is responsible for shipment, installation and calibration of one unit to AFIT/ENY (Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio). <br />Firms responding should indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, and what type of small business (i.e. women owned, hub zone, etc). The general definition of a small business is one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is proposing on Air Force contracts and with its affiliates. NAICS Code to be used for this acquisition is 541330 with a size standard of $4,500,000. The Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent acquisition. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.<br />Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONBACKGROUNDIt is important that qualified NASA personnel and NASA contractor personnel have readyaccess to Technical Standards Products and other NASA-developed documents provided by theNASA Technical Standards Project Office to the contractor, including Lessons Learned/BestPractices/Application Notes, and standards update notification system in order toaccomplish their assigned tasks through a single access point via their individualcomputer workstationsNASA intends to award a contract for the NASA Integrated Technical Standards System(ITSS). Currently there are two separate contracts: NNM06AA02C for ElectronicSubscription Delivery of Standards Products (ESDSP) and NNM06AA03C for ITSS.  The currentcontracts are held by Information Handling Services (IHS) and have a period ofperformance through 06/29/2011. However, NASA intends to combine the two into onecontract for this award. The anticipated contract will consist of a one (1) year base andtwo (2) 1-year options. NASA Integrated Technical Standards System is to providequalified Agency wide NASA users and NASA contractors with effective access to technicalstandards from Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) through a fully integrated andseamless system.  NASA INTEGRATED TECHNICAL STANDARDS SYSTEM (ITSS) The current capabilities of the NASA Integrated Technical Standards System componentsare: 1.	The ITSS provides electronic subscription delivery of standards products plusnecessary document metadata and access to standards documents integrated into the NASAIntegrated Technical Standards System.	The current Agency-wide Full-Text TechnicalStandards System, accessible at http://standards.nasa.gov , has as its principalobjective the retrieval and dissemination of standards documents and related informationto NASA personnel and NASA Contractor users in an expeditious manner.  The systemprovides one-stop access to Technical Standards Products (i.e., standards,specifications, handbooks, guidelines, recommended practices, etc.) developed by NASA andother government and non-government Standards Developing Organizations (SDO), as well asto other NASA-developed documents (e.g., NASA Directives).  This ITSS provides access toStandards Products via the web to individual user workstations.  The user is providedon-demand access to the standard or other document if it is electronically available, orthe capability to order the hard copy or electronic document.2.	Notification of changes to technical standards are provided by the ITSS. Changesto technical standards can have major impacts on the safety, performance, reliability,and cost of NASAs programs and projects.  The ITSS allows users to register NASA, othergovernment, and non-government developed standards documents to receive automaticnotifications when the document is revised, superseded, cancelled, etc.  A capability isprovided in the ITSS for maintaining the notification and tracking system to ensureupdates to standards are accurate and current. 3.	The capability is provided within the ITSS to integrate any technical standardwith the Agencys lessons learned (LL) data, best practices (BP)  data and applicationnotes (AN). This capability for communicating and sharing past scientific and technicalexperience is crucial to the Agencys continued success in maintaining scientific andtechnical excellence and in mission accomplishments in the future.  By providinghyperlinks to all NASA LL/BPs/ANs and identifying those that have applicability to theuse of individual Technical Standards products, this the ITSS enhances the users abilityto apply the best and most current technical knowledge to the task being addressed.  4.	The ITSS provides a strategic and cost effective licensing approach for standardsand related documents accessed by NASA.5.	The ITSS provides access or links to Engineering tools (e.g. components and partsdatabases, material databases, logistic databases, etc.) NASA User Community.  The contractor selected shall provide access via the ITSS to theNASA user community comprised of NASA personnel and NASA contractor personnel residing ateach of the 16 NASA Facilities and their ancillary facilities located outside the NASAFacilities physical boundaries, whose identity and authenticity have been verified bythe NTSP Office.

<p><strong><br />Program Summary</strong></p>
<p>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) seeks to launch a Science and Engineering Fellowship Program that selects and places scientists, medical doctors, and engineers in MCC's Washington Headquarters and overseas Missions. The Fellowship Program will help MCC obtain technical expertise to contribute to the more effective application of science and technology in the international development and foreign affairs activities of the U.S. government. For Fellows, the program is an opportunity to engage in international science policy and to contribute to addressing important societal problems.</p>
<p>The MCC seeks to pattern Science and Engineering Fellowship Program along the lines of the Science, Engineering and Diplomacy, Security &amp; Development Fellowship program that was initiated at USAID in 1982. In the 28 year history of that program, nearly 400 fellows have been placed at USAID, in Washington or field missions. The Fellows Program has been a very successful mechanism for USAID offices to access scientists and engineers with up-to-date and diverse technical expertise to meet the Agency's strategic objectives in areas such as climate change, biotechnology, infectious diseases, and energy. In addition, the Fellows bring with them connections to a broad scientific community, expanding MCC's collaborations and partnerships. This program is currently administered under a cooperative agreement with the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<p><strong>Program Components </strong></p>
<p>The design of this activity is based on the USAID's past experience with science and engineering fellowships. The recipient organization needs to have the capacity to select outstanding postdoctoral-level to senior level scientists, medical doctors, political scientists, and engineers to serve for one to two years in MCC/Washington or an overseas MCC Mission. The placement of Fellows at MCC will mirror our operational requirements; currently these include but are not limited to: agriculture, engineering, education, environment, social science (including gender), health, land programs, economic analysis and monitoring and evaluation. The Fellowship Program will help MCC obtain technical expertise to contribute to the more effective application of science and technology in the international development and foreign affairs activities of the U.S. government. For Fellows, the program is an opportunity to engage in international science policy and to contribute to addressing important societal problems.</p>
<p>The recipient organization will be responsible for the recruitment, primary selection and placement, and administration of Fellows in MCC/Washington offices and overseas MCC Missions through an open and competitive process. The recipient organization should have the capacity to place and provide oversight of approximately two (2) Fellows, annually, to include new incoming fellows, renewing second year fellows and overseas fellows, during the life of the award, which is expected to be 5 years. Fellowships will last up to 4 years.</p>
<p>The recipient will be responsible for advertising and soliciting candidates from a broad range of scientific, social science, and engineering backgrounds that match the areas in which MCC works and therefore should have expertise in working with the scientific, technical, and engineering communities. The recruitment should also emphasize diversity in geographic location, types of technical institutions (e.g., universities, industry, nongovernmental organizations, etc.), gender, and cultural perspectives. Candidates should be highly competitive in their technical areas and bring to the Fellowship Program an understanding of the latest developments in their technical field and the ability to leverage the broader scientific community in their field in support of MCC's Mission.</p>
<p>Other capabilities that the recipient organization should be able to demonstrate include the ability to organize an orientation program for new Fellows to MCC, provide mentoring opportunities to ensure a productive relationship, offer formal and structured networking and professional career development building opportunities that provide Fellows with exposure to a broad range of national and international issues, especially as they relate to science and technology, implement an effective evaluation program to strengthen the program in out years, and collaborate with MCC to support Fellows. Additionally, the recipient organization will be required to maintain or obtain a valid facility security clearance and to facilitate the federal security clearance process for each potential candidate.</p>
<p>The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualification of various organizations, institutions and businesses. Therefore, the notice is being posted on both grants.gov and FedBizOpps in order to reach the broadest number of interested concerns. The applicable NAICS Code is 561110, Management Services.</p>
<p>It is MCC's intention to find qualified sources that possess the capability to perform this type of requirement.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES/PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: The NIA provides funding in support of aging-related research in an effort to uncover the mechanisms behind "healthy" and "unhealthy" aging in order to promote good health throughout life. Atherosclerosis has been linked to a broad range of cardiovascular diseases and affects nearly all people at some point in their lives. There is a potential association between the rate of aging-associated vascular change and atherosclerosis with a mediating role for the effects of regional adipose tissue distribution. The VALIDATE contract ("Vascular Aging: The Link that Bridges Age to Atherosclerosis") was awarded in 2003 to investigate this hypothesis and was largely completed in March, 2011. It is a two-visit study in which physiologic vascular properties and Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT)-defined extent of coronary atherosclerotic change as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-defined body composition and vascular change are measured in different volunteer and patient populations. The NIA is conducting a one-year extension study to complete a second MDCT scan on study participants. <br />This contract will continue the Validate study and will provide MDCT for the "second visits" of all remaining VALIDATE participants, in order to investigate the determinants of "healthy" vs. "unhealthy" vascular aging. While much of the study was completed in March 2011, there are a number of participants (~237) who have not completed their second visits and will therefore require a repeat MDCT. In addition, body composition will be assessed in a small number of participants at the Clinical Research Branch.<br />The Contractor shall coordinate and provide MDCT for the "second visits" of all remaining VALIDATE participants. As the first visit for each participant has been completed already, the Contractor shall provide imaging equipment directly comparable to that used previously. The CT scan equipment used in the first visit is the Toshiba Aquilion One, 320 Slice Scanner. The Contractor must provide a MDCT facility in close proximity to the NIA Clinical Research Branch (CRB) because participants are required to come to the Clinical Research Branch (CRB) on the same day as their MDCT for further testing. The contractor shall provide a Clinical reading of all MDCT scans completed which will include vessel anatomy, degree of atherosclerosis, and relevant extra-cardiac findings. These reports will be provided regularly with a summary of all studies and findings to be provided after 6 months and after 12 months.<br /><br />REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: Semi-Annual Progress Report and Final Report. <br /><br />ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is one (1) year (12/01/2011-11/30/2012).<br /><br />OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees is being contemplated.<br /><br />CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT: Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work as specified in paragraph "Background/Purpose and Objectives/Project Requirements" above; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and, (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (f) access to the same cohort of subjects (2) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUB Zone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; and, (4) any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the OPDIV's acquisition requirement.<br /><br />INFORMATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Respondents should provide responses accordingly: (1) submit information both electronically and by mail. No telephone or facsimile responses will be accepted; (2) format capability statements using Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF including attachments, resumes, charts, etc. Use single space, 12 font minimum and 8 &frac12; x 11 size paper; (3) organize material in such a manner that clearly identifies and address capability requirements and provide an executive summary; (4) capability statement should not exceed ten (10) single sided pages including references; (5) respondents must send two original copies via mail and one electronic copy via email; (6) responses should be received no later than May 10, 2011 at 2:00 PM Local Time; (7) include respondents' technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses; and (8) send responses to this notice via email to mclaurinsm@nida.nih.gov.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND NIA funded research programs using rodents to model aging processes and age-related diseases in humans require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status. Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain animal models suitable for the study of biological and behavioral processes in aging. Caloric restriction, in which the calories are restricted to maintain a stable adult body weight but all other nutritional needs are met, is a proven intervention to extend lifespan and improve health. Calorically restricted rodents are used to investigate the cellular and physiological biology of normal aging. A colony of aged, calorically restricted laboratory rodents, of defined genetic backgrounds and health status, is an integral part of the NIA's program of research on aging. In 2004, NIA awarded a 9-year contract for the development and maintenance of a colony of caloric restricted rodents.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES The objective is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined, calorically restricted rodents for use by investigators in studies of aging.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS This colony shall be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity. The expected duration of this colony is nine (9) years; the colony population at the end of each year of the nine year period should be approximately as follows:</p>
<p>YEAR 1 400 YEAR 4 2800 YEAR 7 2800<br />YEAR 2 1600 YEAR 5 2800 YEAR 8 1600<br />YEAR 3 2800 YEAR 6 2800 YEAR 9 Near 0</p>
<p>This animal colony shall be divided into two, approximately equal, separate segments. Each segment shall be maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period. Both segments shall specifically be helicobacter-negative.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire foundation stock for two inbred strains of mice from a stock center identified by the COTR and shall re-derive the stock by caesarian section or embryo transfer under barrier conditions. After re-derivation, testing to confirm genetic purity and SPF health status shall be performed on the foundation colony, and breeding colonies will be established for the two inbred strains and one derivative hybrid strain. Animals will be entered into the aging colony at levels defined in the contract Statement of Work (SOW), currently a total of 1260 animal per year.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment. Since this is an aging colony, the Contractor must be prepared to house the animals for up to 3-4 years.</p>
<p>Current ILAR (http://www.nap.edu/books/0309053773/html/index.html) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) for breeding, care and maintenance of laboratory rats shall apply where specifications have not been detailed.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: (1) Post re-derivation Health and Genetic Monitoring Report; (2) Semi-Annual Progress Report; (3) Weekly Inventory Report; (4) Quarterly Health Monitoring Reports; (5) Genetic Monitoring Reports; (6) Individual Postmortem Reports - (7) Final Report</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. The anticipated period of performance is nine years.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 112990 with a size standard of $.75 Million is being contemplated.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT: Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding the respondents' (a) capability to perform the work as described above; (b) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (c) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (d) prior completed projects of similar nature; (e) corporate experience and management capability; and, (f) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code.</p>
<p>INFORMATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Respondents should provide responses accordingly: (1) submit information both electronically and by mail. No telephone or facsimile responses will be accepted; (2) format capability statements using Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF including attachments, resumes, charts, etc. Use single space, 12 font minimum and 8 &frac12; x 11 size paper; (3) organize material in such a manner that clearly identifies and address capability requirements and provide an executive summary; (4) capability statement should not exceed ten (10) single sided pages including references; (5) respondents must send two original copies via mail and one electronic copy via email; (6) responses should be received no later than May 5, 2011 at 2:00 PM Local Time; (7) include respondents' technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses; and (8) send responses to this notice via email to dl294p@nih.gov.

<p>YEAR 1 400&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YEAR 4 2800&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YEAR 7 2800<br />YEAR 2 1600&nbsp;&nbsp; YEAR 5 2800&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YEAR 8 1600<br />YEAR 3 2800&nbsp;&nbsp; YEAR 6 2800&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YEAR 9 Near 0</p>
<p>This animal colony shall be divided into two, approximately equal, separate segments. Each segment shall be maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period. Both segments shall specifically be helicobacter-negative.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire foundation stock for two inbred strains of mice from a stock center identified by the COTR and shall re-derive the stock by caesarian section or embryo transfer under barrier conditions. After re-derivation, testing to confirm genetic purity and SPF health status shall be performed on the foundation colony, and breeding colonies will be established for the two inbred strains and one derivative hybrid strain. Animals will be entered into the aging colony at levels defined in the contract Statement of Work (SOW), currently a total of 1260 animal per year.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment. Since this is an aging colony, the Contractor must be prepared to house the animals for up to 3-4 years.</p>

Siemens a dedicated reporting system is installed in various buildings to provide customized reports to the users. The report includes space temperature, humidity, air change per hour, alarm conditions, time and length when the alarm was in effect, hardware, bios software, graphical software, programming software, digital and analog inputs, digital and analog outputs, workstations, modems, interface modules, actuators, sensors, transducers, Switch (es), Relay(s), Contact(s), etc.
 to allow for complete monitoring, alarming, commanding and reporting from the existing control and monitoring system. The heart of the system is Siemens proprietary software, which is part of the System. This reporting system has and can, with some modification, be installed in other systems to provide a record of all system condition in various buildings. 

The primary function of this system is to centrally monitor and control the following: 1) HVAC and Mechanical Systems; 2) temperatures, humidity, lighting and air flow to medical facilities, industrial facilities, office buildings, class rooms, laboratories, computer rooms, and large assembly areas. The Siemens System 600 is found in all Buildings located on NAS Pensacola, Corry Station, Corry Hospital, and Saufley Field.
 Unlike current conventional controls this state-of-the-art system provides many features to allow for extensive data collection and data distribution through existing communication networks.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
Acquisition of Software Tools to Support Quality Assurance Testing of Lidar Point Cloud and Associated Data Deliveries

I.  AREA OF INTEREST
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is requesting product, cost, and delivery information for software applications to support automatic and manual Quality Assurance (QA) of lidar point cloud and associated derived data products.  In addition, the USGS is also soliciting information to determine the availability of capable contractors that can provide these tools, provide training, and perform software maintenance support.
II. RESPONSES
Respondents should submit the RFI deliverables specified below for Software Tools to support QA of lidar point cloud and associated data deliveries.
Although information gained from this Request for Information (RFI) may be used to secure funding and initiate mapping contracts, the government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI.  It is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.
III. BACKGROUND
Continued development of lidar technology and the industry over the past decade has demonstrated the broad range of applications of lidar point cloud data, beyond simple derived DEMs.  Many of these non-DEM applications are of significant interest to the USGS. With the implementation of the USGS-NGP Lidar Guidelines and Base Specifications-Draft v13 (the Spec), the USGS has expanded its technical interest in lidar beyond the delivery of derived DEMs to include the source lidar point cloud data, intensity image, and perhaps waveform data.  This shift is particularly important as lidar coverage continues to expand, potentially spawning a national lidar layer, and the need for consistency in point cloud data structure becomes more urgent.The v13 Spec includes a number of new technical requirements on lidar point cloud deliverables for which efficient means of validation are currently unavailable. These include, but are not limited to, validation of: LAS compliance; presence of all requisite deliverables; conformance to the Spec and project-specific requirements; content; and accuracy of metadata and reports. Many of these requirements can be validated automatically by configurable software.  Other requirements will require a framework for visualization and manipulation in which QA task-driven manual inspection can occur.  The USGS seeks detailed technical information on existing software tools, the potential for modification of existing applications, or the development of new software tools to allow efficient, accurate, and detailed QA of lidar point cloud and associate data products.

IV. PROPOSED MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS 
It is assumed that any application will require some initial user input/configuration to establish the location and identification of key files, a folder containing deliverable files, and project specific parameters that may differ from the base requirements of the v13 Spec.
The v13 Spec requires full compliance with the LAS Specification. Some of the LAS requirements may be noted in this RFI. The exclusion of specific LAS requirements in this document DOES NOT mean that these requirements do not need to be checked. Respondents should thoroughly review the LAS v1.2/v1.3 specifications.
The following list may not be exhaustive. Recommendations from respondents on additional or alternative functions are welcome and should be included in the response. 
The Automatic and Manual checks can be addressed by separate software modules, provided there is integration between the modules to remove the necessity for manual transfer of initial configuration or derived information between modules.
AUTOMATIC CHECKS
1.  Verify that all LAS files are fully compliant with either LAS v1.2 or v1.3 (this covers a very large number of checks which will not be detailed in this RFI. A thorough review of the LAS Specification by respondents will be required).2.  Verify that any LAS v1.3 files use external wave packet files, and that each v1.3 .las file has a corresponding .wpd file.3.  Verify that LAS files have not been trimmed (presence of Edge Of Scan flags)4.  Verify that all LAS files use Point Record Format 1, 3, 4, or 55.  Verify that all LAS files are =< 2GB6.  Verify that all LAS files do not use Class=127.  Verify that all points have been classified (no Class=0)8.  Verify that the Withheld Bit has been used9.  Verify that all LAS files use the correct GPS Time format and that recorded times are logical.10.  Verify (identify) the collection time windows.11.  Verify that all LAS files use the same CRS and contain complete and correct projection information.12.  Verify the NPS of the LAS data (single swath, 1st returns) 13.  Verify the non-clustering of the LAS data (single swath, 1st returns)14.  Verify the overlap of the LAS data (swath)15.  Verify the maximum scan angle (swath)16.  Verify that all Classification values conform to the project Specs (tiles)17.  Verify that LAS data (swaths) are free of data voids  identify void areas18.  Verify the relative accuracy between swaths19.  Verify the relative accuracy within swaths20.  Verify absolute accuracy calculations using provided check-points:a.  Against Lidar Points (FVA only)b.  Against DEMs (FVA, SVA(s), CVA)21.  Verify that the collection completely covers the buffered project area22.  Verify that each swath contains a unique File Source ID23.  Verify that each point contains a Point Source ID consistent with its File Source ID (swaths)24.  Verify that Point Source IDs have been carried-over into LAS tiles25.  Verify (identify) the range of Intensity values in all LAS files.26.  Verify that all points in all LAS files contain Intensity Values27.  Verify the validity of the XML Metadata files28.  Verify consistency between metadata information and LAS header information29.  Verify that units of Foot or Feet specify US Survey or International.30.  Verify that the number of tiled deliverables (LAS, DEM, Intensity, etc.) is consistent with the number of tiles in the Project Tile Index31.  Verify that the naming of tiled deliverables is consistent with the tile names in the Project Tile Index32.  Verify that within tiled deliveries, tiles do not contain overlap33.  Verify that all tiled deliverables contain correct and complete CRS information34.  Verify that breaklines are PolylineZ or PolygonZ (3D geometry)35.  Verify that Intensity Images (if delivered) are rescaled to 8-bit grayscale.36.  Verify that breakline elevations are at or below the coincident DEM elevations37.  Verify that coincident vertices/nodes (same X-Y) within the breaklines have the same Z.
MANUAL CHECKS
A basic visualization framework is needed to perform the following inspections. May be a separate module from the automatic check module, and may utilize another visualization environment such as ArcGIS.
1.  Inspection of all delivered products (LAS, DEM, Breaklines, Images) with display of embedded CRS information, and compared to known CRS geo-spatial reference data (i.e., ESRI data)2.  Inspection of identified VOID areas, comparing imagery, lidar points, and breaklines3.  Inspection of swath overlap, comparing full swaths.4.  Inspection of data coverage, comparing LAS swaths/tiles, DEMs, images against shapefiles5.  Inspection of entire projects for systematic errors, viewing and/or filtering all LAS points by Elevation, Classification, Return Type, File, Point Source ID, etc. Visualization of entire project DEM surfaces in grayscale or color ramp, with or without hill-shading.6.  Visualization of LAS points over Point TIN and/or DEM surfaces. Points must be symbolized independently from surface (i.e., Points colors by Classification with surface colored by hill-shaded elevation).7.  Inspection of hydro-flattening, comparing DEM surface, breaklines, and imagery8.  Measurement tools (length and area)9.  Identification tools (elevation values from DEMs, intensity values from imagery, lidar point attributes)10.  XML metadata reader/editor

<DESC>UNCLASSIFIED//UNCLASSIFIED
<p><br />1. (U) INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>(U) The Virginia Contracting Activity (VaCA) is requesting information from industry to identify candidates to fill a potential need for a small, reconfigurable data link radio.</p>
<p><br />2. (U) PURPOSE</p>
<p>(U) This document serves as the RFI of the VACA contractor community pursuant to FAR 15.201(e) "Exchange with industry before receipt of proposals". Responses to this RFI will be assessed to identify sources that are considered best qualified to meet future requirements. Best qualified sources are those sources which demonstrate the greatest depth and breadth of skills, experiences and knowledge relevant to the mission, goals, and objectives of the VACA.</p>
<p><br />3. (U) BACKGROUND<br />(U) The VaCA is seeking information on the potential application of current technology to flexible radio field set operation in areas where system retrieval is impractical. The devices of interest must exhibit remote reconfigurability that enables fundamental operational changes without any on-site user intervention.<br />(U) The primary system requirement is a size, weight and power profile that enables unattended, embedded sensor operations. The focus is on the core radio functionality, not on particular antenna or power amplifier solutions optimized for an application. Respondents are encouraged to provide relevant information on compelling system performance tradeoffs, even if these result in one or a few unmet requirements. Responses should address off-the-shelf capabilities that are currently available. For off-the-shelf items information on catalogue prices may be submitted.<br />(U/FOUO) Depending on the responses to this RFI, VaCA may decide to move forward with a Request for Proposal in FY12 for a program to develop and acquire flexible field equipment for DoD use in both attended and unattended operations.</p>
<p><br />4. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>(U) Information on equipment that provides the following capabilities is requested:<br />&bull; (U) Support one half-duplex transmit / receive channel.<br />&bull; (U) As a threshold, support operation in at least two of the following RF bands: UHF band (225 - 400 MHz), L band, S band. As an objective, support operation in the frequency range 225 - 2500 MHz.<br />&bull; (U) As a threshold, support information rates of 50 bps to 100 kbps. As an objective, support information rates of 10 bps to 1 Mbps.

<DESC>WHAT THIS IS
This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the IRS.
THE PURPOSE
The IRS would like to coordinate with the furniture industry to figure out ways to reduce the environmental "footprint" of IRS furniture purchases.
ATTACHMENTS
There are (3) documents attached 
-"RFI v.1" is geared toward assessing the feasibility and means to increase the purchase of "green" furniture as well as assess the potential costs involved.
-"RFI-Survey for Remanu Serv" is geared toward evaluating opportunities for recycling and refurbishing existing IRS furniture inventory.
-"B.64.1 NWS-030107pg128" is a typical IRS workstation for vendor use in determining costs and feasibility of potential improvements.
NEXT STEPS
We understand some vendors will be more interested in certain aspects of this RFI and do not expect a vendor / manufacturer to respond to all portions. Likewise, if your company has other ways to reduce the environmental "footprint" that are not mentioned in any of these documents, please respond with those ideas as well. We would like to request more specific information to the IRS, rather than simply "sales" information regarding your specific company.

As a result of this RFI there may be vendor tele-conferences set-up with multiple vendors in the industry and/or one-on-one meetings / conference calls as needed.

This RFI is not connected with a specific up-coming IRS project and there is no promise of contracts to specific vendors in relation to this RFI.

Please contact Zach Rich electronically (zach.rich@irs.gov - no phone calls or faxes will be responded to) for further information, and/or to coordinate the sharing of your companies capabilities and ideas in regards to this RFI.

<DESC>E11PS00712 - Special Announcement Text:
The National Park Service, Hawaii Volcanoes National, intends to award on a sole source basis with the Research Corporation of the University of Hawaii, Inc., dba RCUH, for the procurement to conduct chemical analysis of water quality samples.  Water quality sampling is conducted at all Pacific Island Network parks (HAVO, PUHO, KAHO, PUHE, ALKA, HALE, KALA, NPSA, WAPA, and AMME).  The PACN is utilizing the facility to conduct laboratory analysis for a full set of water quality samples to be analyzed for the three given parameters:  total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and nitrate (NO3).  In accordance with FAR 6.302 and 5.2, this notice advertises the government's intent to award a non-competitive contract for one base year at a firm-fixed price.  This notice of intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest, Proposals or Quotations.  A determination by the Park Service not to open this requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Park Service in consideration of what is in the best interest of the Government.  The NAICS Code is 541380.  This announcement is for informational purposes only.
Comments and questions regarding this announcement may be directed to Claudette M. Moreno, Contracting Specialist, at claudette_moreno@nps.gov.  All comments received by May 6, 2011 will be considered.  

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):_____________________________________________________________________________________The Natural Resource Challenge (NRC), initiated in 1999 under the auspices of the Omnibus Act (1998), is an action plan for preserving natural resources throughout the National Park Service (NPS). To meet the goals of the NRC, the NPS established 32 Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) networks, including 270 National Parks, to better economize their funding. Each network is comprised of NPS units that share geographical and natural resource characteristics, allowing these parks to share financial resources and expertise. Because program funding is limited and not everything within park ecosystems can be monitored, monitoring programs were built around measuring critical parameters (Vital Signs) within each network in order to gauge ecosystem health. The information gained by monitoring will be used for natural resource management decision-making.As defined by the NPS, Vital Signs are a subset of physical, chemical, and biological elements and processes of park ecosystems that are selected to represent the overall health or condition of park resources, known or hypothesized effects of stressors, or elements that have important human values. This subset of monitored resources and processes is part of the total suite of natural resources that park managers are directed to preserve "unimpaired for future generations" (National Park Service Organic Act of 1916), including water, air, geological resources, plants and animals, and the various ecological, biological, and physical processes that act on those resources." Major challenges addressed in the NRC pertinent to aquatic environments include native and endangered species, non-native species, environmental stewardship, and water quality.  Pursuant to accomplishing the above mentioned goals, the Pacific Island Inventory and Monitoring Network (PACN) is implementing its water quality monitoring program. Water quality sampling is conducted at all PACN parks (HAVO, PUHO, KAHO, PUHE, ALKA, HALE, KALA, NPSA, WAPA, and AMME). The PACN is seeking approval to extend a service contract to procure laboratory analyses in the amount not to exceed $33,833 for the full set of water quality samples to be analyzed for the three given parameters: total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and nitrate (NO3).Currently, samples are being collected, filtered, frozen, and stored awaiting lab analysis which is being done by the University of Hawaii at Hilo Marine Analytical Laboratory. This sampling will continue with no identified termination date. Samples are collected on a quarterly basis and it is best to get the samples analyzed as quickly as possible. Sampling effort is expected to be approximately 471 triplicate samples per year totaling approximately 354 water samples per quarter. Each sampling effort requires a least 1 blank and 2 standards per 25 samples, bringing the total laboratory sample numbers to 1471 per year. Sampling occurs monthly across the Pacific, so samples are sent in batch as monthly sampling occurs. Parameters to be analyzed include total phosphorous, total nitrogen, and nitrate content of all water samples provided.  
This laboratory analysis acquisition will specifically benefit NPS natural resource programs and national initiatives including the Inventory and Monitoring Program, in addition to enabling parks within the PACN to monitor compliance with national, state, territorial, and commonwealth clean water regulations.
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale  (Check one and explain below):
___X__	Only one responsible source. ______	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. ______ Other   _____________________________________________________ 
Explain:  While there are many laboratories that conduct a variety of water chemistry analysis, the University of Hawaii at Hilo Analytical Laboratory is the only viable Water Chemistry Analytical Laboratory for this contracting effort. According to the standard water chemistry analysis protocols utilized in the Pacific Island Network's Water Quality Monitoring Protocol, water samples have a maximum holding time of 48 hours from collection to laboratory analysis. This follows standard NEMI (National Environmental Methods Index) analysis protocols for Nitrate, Total Nitrogen, and Total Phosphate measurements.
The University of Hawaii Analytical Laboratory is uniquely geographically located within minutes of the Hilo International Airport on the Big Island of Hawaii (Hawaii, Hawaii). This geography is crucial to the success of this water chemistry analysis contract. PACN (Pacific Islands Network) I&M (Inventory and Monitoring) staff are based in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, utilizing the services of the Hilo International Airport for travel. As such, the Hilo International Airport is the terminating terminal for water sampling activities conducted within the PACN National Parks, which include parks in Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, and Hawaii. As it takes approximately 1 full day to collect all water samples, that leaves only 24 hours to get the samples from the field to the laboratory. Express Packages from American Samoa, Guam, and Saipan are not guaranteed 24 hour delivery. This means that the only viable option is for technicians to carry samples with them when returning from the field, to Hilo. Return travel from these remote places takes approximately 16- hours, leaving only about 8 hours to get the samples to the lab and get them processed in the best of circumstances. The unique location of the University of Hawaii Analytical Laboratory relative to the Hilo International Airport, ideally situates this laboratory to receive samples with enough time to process them before reaching the 48 hour maximum. No other qualified laboratories are viable options for sample processing, making the University of Hawaii Analytical Laboratory the sole source capable of carrying out this contract in a viable way.
 3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:No additional market research was conducted prior to this extension request because the  University of Hawaii-Hilo Analytical Lab is the only reasonable and responsible entity with which to contract.  Their prices have not changed and when initially researched were among the cheapest in the nation.4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<ARCHDATE>04252011
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Fleet Industrial Supply Center (FISC), Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division intends to procure appointment clerk services at Captain James Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC).   Centralized appointing services are required in support of daily operations at FHCC. The services include verifying registration information in the appointment system, correcting and registering beneficiaries prior to making the appointment, making and cancelling of patient appointments, making urgent appointments with non-Military Treatment Facility providers (network/non-network) and providing performance management reports on the appointing process for Military Health system eligible beneficiaries.
  FISCs intent is to issue a firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR 12 (Commercial Items) and FAR 13.5 (Test Program for Certain Commercial Items) procedures.  The Period of Performance is from 01 April 2011 through 31 August 2011, plus one one-month option ending 30 September 2011, if exercised.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2), Unusual and Compelling Urgency, as implemented by FAR 6.302-2.   The need for this effort is to mitigate a break in service on the existing Appointment Clerk Services contract W81K04-05-D-7001 DO 0002 which expires 31 March 2011, while a new contract is put in place.  There are no options available to extend the current contract.
    A new contract was placed on 01 March 2011 with a 01 April 2011 start date.  However, the contractor is not able to start performance by 01 April 2011 because of the time that is required to obtain proper security clearances for new employees.  These services are necessary to ensure that military members and their beneficiaries are able to access necessary medical care.  This effort is to prevent a break in service while the original proposers submit quotes that will include a management plan technical factor, a transition plan, and also to allow for a three month start-up period to ensure all security requirements, including a change from SF85 to SF86, are fulfilled before the start date.
    The change in the security requirements was caused by a renewed focus and emphasis by BUMED HQ Security to bring BUMED in compliance with the DoD Security Instruction issued in 2006.

<RESPDATE>051611
<CONTACT>Madeline Y. Baumgartner, Email madeline.baumgartner@socom.mil
<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION:
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to gain information leading to Government/Industry collaboration for development of U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) technology capabilities and to assist in accelerating the delivery of these capabilities to the warfighter.</p>
<p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) invites industry, academia, individuals and labs to submit technology experimentation papers addressing innovative technology capabilities used in austere environments: specifically, commercial wireless technologies to augment existing network infrastructure with a mobile Command, Control, and Communication (C3) capability comprising a Special Operations Wireless Connectivity Capability (SOWCC) experimentation project. As part of this project, a tactical cellular wireless network, using commercial 3G/4G standards, will provide C3 and situational awareness (SA) capabilities down to the Company level and below.</p>
<p>After review of the technology experimentation paper submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to demonstrate their capabilities in USSOCOM sponsored experiments, to be held quarterly at Camp Roberts, CA. These experiments will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities.</p>
<p>Technology Experimentation papers shall be submitted electronically to: madeline.baumgartner@socom.mil SUBJECT: 3G/4G for SOF. Technology Experimentation papers may be submitted at any time during the effective period. <br /><br />B. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>(1) Background : The USSOCOM conducts quarterly experiments in cooperation with the Naval Postgraduate School at Camp Roberts, CA. These experiments are conducted with representatives from Government Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, academia and private industry. The experiments provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel and determine how their efforts might support special operations capabilities. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between academia, government, and industry and supports identification, assessment, and dissemination of emerging and mature technology information and the acceleration of delivery of capabilities to the Special Operations warfighter and those they support.</p>
<p>(2) Experiment Focus: Experiments will be conducted from 15-18 August 2011 at Camp Roberts, CA to explore the application of emerging technology solutions providing SOF 3G/4G cellular wireless capabilities. The following areas are of particular focus/interest:</p>
<p>a. Use of commercial 3G/4G cellular standards.<br />b. Support 50 simultaneous users and 300 registered users per cell.<br />c. Provide a minimum of 5 Mbps downlink and 1 Mbps uplink to each active connection.<br />d. Achieve a range of 1.5 km per cell.<br />e. Execute handover of user equipment between cells.<br />f. Provide a remote command and control capability over the wireless network and connected devices.<br />g. Allow IP traffic exchange between mobile handsets and Enterprise services.<br />h. The ability to secure handsets with industry standard encryption<br />Candidate cellular wireless networks should also approach satisfying the following objective capabilities:<br />a. Regional spectrum flexibility: enable network to operate in different commercial standard spectrums with minimum hardware modification or replacement.<br />b. Quality of Service: enable rules-based connection control and bandwidth modification to support quality of service rules.<br />c. Low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP).<br />d. Integration with Enterprise Voice over IP (VoIP) infrastructure: enable mobile devices and fixed devices in the Enterprise network to initiative and execute voice communication with the other.<br />e. Integration, co-existence or masked operations with local commercial cellular networks.</p>
<p>Technology to be demonstrated shall be at a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6. Detailed information on TRLs can be found at http://www.dod.mil/ddre/doc/May2005_TRA_2005_DoD.pdf</p>
<p>(3) Security Requirements: The submittal process under this RFI is intended to be as streamlined as possible in order to allow the government to leverage technology solutions that are capable of meeting urgent warfighter needs. Vendors should not submit classified information in the technology experimentation papers.</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ) and is being issued as full and open and the request is for one (1 ea) fully operational, stand-alone, compact, high performance inertially stabilized long range Day/Night (EO/IR) camera system especially configured for use on aerostats. The solicitation document, incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38, Effective 31 Jan 2011.</p>
<p>The government requires the following items, SEE DESCRIPTION/SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS BELOW. All responsible sources for this equipment may submit a quotation which shall be considered. Prospective offerors must be CCR registered and must complete the ORCA on-line representation or provide a copy of their representation and certification as required by FAR Clause 52.212-3. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334511 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.</p>
<p>1. Description/Salient Characteristics:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: This requirement is for the purchase of one (1 ea) fully operational, stand-alone, compact, high performance inertially stabilized long range Day/Night (EO/IR) camera system especially configured for use on aerostats. System must be capable of being mounted, installed, and integrated on to a USAF Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) 420K balloon platform.</p>
<p>System must be able to operate off of available on-board power. TARS uses an on-board 400Hz 120V AC 3 phase power generator system.</p>
<p>Required to operate from 0' to 15,000' MSL.<br />Power consumption for airborne equipment items should not exceed 300 Watts<br />Total weight for airborne equipment items should not exceed 175 lbs</p>
<p>Video Output: NTSC/PAL<br />Full motion video<br />Turret mechanical movement: 360 degrees continuous in Azimuth; +20 to -100 degrees in elevation<br />Cameras, turret, and all electronics (except for remote control/display equipment) will be airborne. All airborne equipment must be environmentally enclosed/protected. When eventually installed on a TARS, the airborne equipment will be exposed to the environment. System must include available documentation, i.e., user manuals (install/maint/ops/etc.).</p>
<p>Camera system operational capabilities both EO and IR:<br />Detect and classify a human target @ 10km or greater<br />Detect and classify a SUV style vehicle @ 20km or greater</p>
<p>CLIN 0002: Requirement is for one (1 ea) commercial, FCC approved wireless communications system to remote control the camera system and to bring video down from the balloon and display it. Required operational distance for the wireless comm. system is 0km (balloon moored to TARS site) up to 35km (balloon aloft to closest BP Station).

<p style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text">(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. </span></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Blood Collection Vacuum Tubes. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<br />This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is July 2011</strong>. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Ms. Toni Massenburg, MMESO North, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil and 202-782-3663.<br /></strong><br />B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Blood Collection Vacuum Tubes. Within MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $2,538,490.25. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top sixteen (16) line items of the total one hundred and thirty one (131) line items purchased, account for 79.7% ($2,024,927.35) of the total volume in sales ($2,538,490.25) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 15 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ms. Toni Massenburg, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial response will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that their initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO North via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>A vendor that does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO North reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendor and determine whether vendor meets the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)-Completely unacceptable, two (2)-overwhelmingly unacceptable, three (3)-partially unacceptable, four (4)-acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable. The MMESO TPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.<br />A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor that has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO North, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. Each requirement for Blood Collection Tubes will be evaluated by four (4) trials (each clinical trial site will have three (3) clinical evaluators who will each evaluate all samples), in a clinical/ patient care setting.</p>
<p>There will be approximately fourteen (14) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below.<br />1.

<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs.<strong> Pricing must be received at the MMESO North by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

Sydnor - Contract Specialist, 301-713-0838 ext 203 The quote should not exceed 10 pages and should be submitted in hard copy (6 copies) and electronically. Background-The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) is a Congressionally-mandated interagency task force made up of the heads of the 20 U.S. Government agencies with oversight of, or responsibility for, trade and is chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. The TPCC was created by the Export Enhancement Act of 1992 to coordinate the export promotion and export finance activities of the U.S. Government. One of the chief duties of the TPCC is to ensure better delivery of services to U.S. businesses. The mission of the U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (ITA), is to strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promote trade and investment, and ensure fair trade and compliance with trade laws and agreements. Because of the broader responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce beyond trade, the Under Secretary for ITA serves as the de facto Deputy Chair of the TPCC. For this reason, the TPCC Secretariat is located within ITA. One of the mandates of the legislation which created the TPCC is a yearly report due to Congress detailing the National Export Strategy. The 2002 National Export Strategy Report called on the trade promotion agencies to develop a training program to improve customer service by strengthening interagency cooperation and client management. Prior research indicated that customer service would improve if trade promotion staff in each agency had a more sophisticated understanding of the programs of other Federal agencies in addition to their own, and how they all interrelate, in order to best serve the needs of their clients. Based on these identified needs and priorities, the TPCC created the TPCC Interagency Trade Officer Training Program in 2003, conducting three four-day sessions that year with the support of temporarily assigned staff and a contractor. In 2004, the TPCC retained a full-service contractor to continue developing the curriculum and to organize and facilitate three training sessions. In 2005, the program was extended through 2007 with an award and subsequent exercise of two option year renewals. In 2008, the Program was again extended through 2010 with an award and subsequent exercise of two option year renewals. The TPCC plans not only to continue this training but to intensify the level of it, given the strong support from TPCC member agencies, strong participant feedback, and especially, the strong underpinning it provides for the Presidential National Export Initiative recommendations calling for training programs to strengthen federal support of small business exporters (this is the directive created by Presidential Executive Order 13534 this past year).Objective-The intent of implementing a dynamic training program for Government trade assistance staff is not only to increase their knowledge and understanding of the array of Government assistance programs available to businesses, but also to improve the communication between the trade promotion agencies and the working relationships between Government trade assistance staff. All of this is directed toward improving the coordination of and collaboration by the programs and the leveraging of resources toward cross-governmental trade promotion priorities-with the ultimate goal of better equipping the Government trade officer (no matter which agency he/she works for) to be able to direct the business client to that part of the Government which can best serve him in his desire to either begin exporting or to increase how much he exports. This obviously becomes an all-around win-win-win situation for the business-person, the people to whom the business-person subsequently provides jobs, and for the country's economy as a whole. Scope of Work-The contractor shall train government business assistance representatives (both managers and staff), to accurately and holistically gauge their customers' needs. This addresses at a specific level; the full array of Federal export promotion, finance, advocacy, market access, and regulatory compliance programs and services that are available, as well as at a broader level; issues surrounding the changing global marketplace. Requirement-The contractor shall provide: 4.1Organization and facilitation of three each year, after extensive consultation with and guidance from the TPCC Training Director4.1.1The duration of each session shall be four days unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). 4.2Scheduling and arrangement for expert presenters from across the Federal Government and private sector 4.3Ongoing development of curriculum topics in response to feedback 4.4Curriculum content and materials reflecting current Government trade promotion and policy priorities 4.5Course content and materials shall give participants a clear understanding of:4.5.1Competitive pressures in the global economy and their impact on the customer service expectations of U.S. companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises4.5.2Best practices Government can employ to create customer value and seamless service delivery across agencies4.5.3Export counseling, marketing, and matchmaking programs throughout Government4.5.4Federal information resources and IT tools for exporters4.5.5Trade financing challenges and Federal financing and risk management solutions4.5.6Federal trade advocacy, foreign market access, and trade agreements compliance services, including resources for addressing standards and intellectual property issues 4.5.7Leveraging interagency resources in pursuit of Administration priorities 4.5.8Other Government programs and policies that U.S. exporters must consider and/or comply with, e.g., export regulations and customs procedures Deliverables-In order to achieve the desired level of interagency staff expertise and understanding, the requirement shall have the following deliverables: 5.1Developing a curriculum of three four-day sessions based on the course content noted above in Sect. 4.5 and extensive consultation with and guidance from the TPCC Training Director 5.2Recruiting and scheduling qualified presenters for each course content topic from throughout the Government and the private sector 5.3Coaching all presenters to address TPCC themes (e.g., interagency client referrals, information sharing, National Export Initiative (NEI), program coordination) 5.4Preparing and producing briefing books and course material CDs for each participant (35-45 per session, 105-135 per year)5.5Developing multiple interactive exercises, including at least two real-world case studies that bring in prominent U.S. company or trade association representatives to work with break-out groups (6 private sector experts made available for each session to present case studies) 5.6Facilitating each four-day session in its entirety, with demonstrated acumen across all Federal agencies and course content areas 5.7Comprehensive evaluation/review of the program with the participants, including providing copies of the feedback forms to the TPCC (and discussion with the TPCC of same) upon conclusion of each session 5.8 Ongoing development of the curriculum with the TPCC to ensure that the Program reflects changes in Government priorities, the business environment, and exporting tools and technologies 5.9 As per subparagraph 4.1 above, in 2011 the three sessions will be conducted in the April/May (first session), June/July (second session), and September (third session) timeframes. Specific dates shall be coordinated with and agreed upon by the COTR. Option year dates shall be established and agreed upon by the COTR at Option renewal timeframe. Period of Performance-The term of the contract will be a base year with two option years to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. Place of Performance-After the extensive preliminary planning and wide-ranging consultation with the TPCC Director of the Training Program, the contractor will then conduct the extensive preparatory work for the program in their own offices. The training program itself will be held in the Main Conference Room of the U.S. Trade Development Agency at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Ste. 1600, Arlington, Virginia 22209. The TPCC Director of the Training Program is in attendance and observes most of the sessions and keeps COTR apprised of status of delivery of services as the training progresses. Government Provided Resources-The Government (the TPCC) will be responsible for recruiting participants for each training session. The Government will also be responsible for reserving the training venue (see "Place of Performance" above). The Government stays in close communication with the contractor and therefore will be available to the contractor for approving final decisions on any last minute curriculum changes, identification of alternative presenters, or other ad hoc course development issues that might arise. The contractor will be responsible for all other resources required Administration-There will be ongoing joint review by the Government (the TPCC Training Director) and the contractor as each session progresses since the Training Director will be on site most of the time. There will also be a joint review with the contractor at the conclusion of each of the training sessions (which includes discussing the participants' evaluation sheets of each individual presenter and of the course; copies of the evaluation sheets are provided to the TPCC, as well as the contractor's summary of them). These reviews will give the TPCC the opportunity to redirect the contractor to make any changes or adjustments deemed necessary as the Program progresses. There will then be a review after the final session each year during which there will be an evaluation of the contractor's overall performance. The Training Director will keep the COTR fully apprised of all developments. Security Requirements-The Government reserves the right to perform any background or security investigations required with current policy.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>The following clarifications are provided by the Government on 28 Feb 11.&nbsp; Also attached in word format for ease of reading.</p>
<p>CLARIFICATIONS for SOLICITATION FA4890-11-T-0002</p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you know if there is a required/preferred band for the wireless system to operate? C, L, S, or Ku band. Since this system is to be operated/delivered in El Paso, TX, I wanted to ensure that the wireless system that we utilize is suitable for your operating environment?</p>
<p>ANSWER: For the communications link, there is no preferred band; however the contractor should avoid bands/freqs the TARS system is currently using due to the potential for interference. For example, the air surveillance radar operates in the S-band. Other freqs currently in use at the Eagle Pass TX TARS site are shown in the attached Clarifications for TARS Camera Purchase document</p>
<p>QUESTION: Is there a requirement for a High Definition (HD) EO/IR system, and wanted to know if this was intentional, or is it assumed that the system would be HD since this is the standard in today's sensors.</p>
<p>ANSWER: The Government assumes that a system meeting today's commercial industry standard regarding Definition would be proposed.</p>

<DESC><p>The following clarifications are provided by the Government on 21 Mar 11 in response to questions from multiple vendors.&nbsp; Also attached in word format for ease of reading.<br /><br />Question #1<br />Is the government requiring (or is it merely requesting) a system that is ultra low latency, less than (&lt;) 1 sec, in order to overcome this difficulty?" <br />Government Response: In addition-"latency" in the command/control of the hardware and monitoring of the video shall not exceed 100ms".</p>
<p>Question #2<br />Will AES 256 be a requirement added to the current performance specifications?<br />Government Response: 256 bit AES encryption is required.</p>
<p>Question #3</p>
<p>Are there any compliance requirements in relation to EMI with a co-located payload on the TARS aerostat?</p>
<p>Government Response: Camera system and comm. link must be able to operate, i.e., be interoperable with all TARS equipment and systems. This includes the L-Band L-88A air surveillance radar. TARS should not affect the camera/comm system and the camera/comm system should not affect TARS. It is the Gov't's intent to not have the camera/comm. systems installed in direct line of sight of the transmitting radar antenna; however, they will be within close proximity (only so much real estate on an 420K aerostat).</p>
<p><br />Question #4:</p>
<p>Is there a requirement for the transmitter to have an FCC Type ID, or is this going to operate in the military frequency band?</p>
<p><br />Is the equipment going to be operated by military, or is there a requirement for FCC licensing/coordination?</p>
<p>Government Response: We are looking for a commercial off the shelf type system that is already FCC approved (there are several 802.11 approved systems out there as well as 802.16 WiMax systems that have been approved). High gain directional antenna for BP station with a high gain omni antenna on the aerostat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Question #5:</p>
<p>Please verify the link distance from the Aerostat to the ground station is up to 35km?</p>
<p>Government Response: The distance between EGP and the EGP-South BP station is actually 36.2 km.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
As a result of this modification/amendment the solicitation closing date has hereby been&nbsp;extended to 28 Mar 11; 4pm Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp; Quotes will be accepted via email only.&nbsp;&nbsp; Submit&nbsp;via email to Karin Walls; ACC AMIC/PKA, <a href="mailto:karin.walls@langley.af.mil">karin.walls@langley.af.mil</a>.&nbsp; Fax responses will not be accepted.&nbsp; It is recommended you call to verify your submission has been received by the deadline.<br />

<p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has a requirement for watch officer support for the Joint Intelligence Operations Center (JIOC) in Washington DC in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). The current estimated period of performance is for a 12 month base year and a 12 month option year period. The government intends to transition these positions to federal employees through insourcing and will notify contractor in writing prior to occurrence.</p>
<p>Provisions<br />The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors in descending order of importance shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Technical Capability<br />(2) Past Performance;<br />(3) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Instructions<br />The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition with the following ADDENDUM:</p>
<p>All responses shall include two separate volumes:<br />Volume 1 - Technical Quotation<br />Volume 2 - Price Quotation</p>
<p>Volume 1 Page Limitation:<br />Excluding cover pages, the key personnel resume, any certificates and quality recognitions/awards; the technical quote is limited to __30__ one-sided pages with a maximum of three pages of tables included. A front and back side of a page will count as two pages. Quotation contents that exceed the stated page limitation will be removed from the quote by the Contracting Officer prior to turning the quote over to the Government evaluation team and will not be considered in the evaluation. Volume 2 does not have a page limitation.</p>
<p>Volume 1<br />Technical Capability<br />Offerors are required to describe their approach or plan to accomplish the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The plan should describe existing capability to meet the PWS task requirements and describe how the offeror will manage and implement effectively the tasks required to accomplish the PWS. Include an overview of the corporate organizational structure in the description and describe roles/responsibilities if any team members or subcontractors are included. Describe the corporate quality control plan and performance measurement approach to cover how performance standards will be monitored, evaluated, and reported. A draft QASP is provided with the solicitation recognizing that the successful Offeror's quality control plan may impact the Government's QASP. The QASP will be finalized within 30 days after award.</p>
<p>Provide a staffing plan describing how the staffing required under the PWS will be filled. The staffing plan should include the timeline from receipt of order to the fill of all positions. The contractor shall describe the education and experience qualifications on the proposed personnel in relation to the personnel requirements in the PWS. Include a resume for the On-site Contract Project Manager (CPM), which is considered a key personnel position. The resume should reflect the ability to perform the complexity of the work required in the PWS. The personnel will be evaluated according to the relevant work experience and qualifications to accomplish the PWS.</p>
<p>The offered capability must present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the PWS with minimal risk to the Government. Lack of specificity or a general offer to perform the PWS may result in a quote being considered unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration for award. Offers are evaluated on the feasibility and completeness of the technical capability to integrate tasking and achieve the PWS with minimal risk to the Government.</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />Offeror's quote shall provide a summary of at least three current or past contracts for the same or similar services, within the last three years. This information should demonstrate how the Offeror has successfully performed work similar to what is described in the PWS. This summary shall also contain sufficient information for the Government to verify contractor past performance and customer satisfaction as follows. <br /><br />1. project title and contract number <br />2. start and end dates <br />3. contract value <br />4. any awards or quality demonstrators of performance achieved<br />5. respective primary Point of Contact for the customer (name, agency or firm affiliation, city and state, phone number and e-mail)</p>
<p>Successful completion of work activities similar in terms of size, complexity, type of work, as well as receipt of awards/recognition and lack of adverse contractual actions, will result in a higher rating than more narrow experience. If an Offeror has no record of relevant past performance or information on performance is not available, the Offeror will receive a "Neutral" rating, which is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has past performance that will enhance its technical capability to perform and whether the offeror consistently delivers quality services in a timely manner. In evaluating past performance, the Government may supplement the information Offerors provide with performance information it may obtain from any source including its own experience with the Offeror and government agency databases.<br /><br />The contractor shall, as part of its proposal, present a high-level transition plan (no more than two pages long) including major milestones for adding resources and transitioning support responsibilities.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis /solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCEMD-11-Q-00002 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) under FAR 13.5. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-49. This procurement is a Total SBA certified-HUBZone Small-Business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690. The size standard is _7 million.</p>
<p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has a requirement for watch officer support for the Joint Intelligence Operations Center (JIOC) in Washington DC in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). The current estimated period of performance is for a 12 month base year and a 12 month option year period. The government intends to transition these positions to federal employees through insourcing and will notify contractor in writing prior to occurrence.</p>
<p>Provisions<br />The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors in descending order of importance shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Technical Capability<br />(2) Past Performance;<br />(3) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Instructions<br />The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition with the following ADDENDUM:</p>
<p>All responses shall include two separate volumes:<br />Volume 1 - Technical Quotation<br />Volume 2 - Price Quotation</p>
<p>Volume 1 Page Limitation:<br />Excluding cover pages, the key personnel resume, any certificates and quality recognitions/awards; the technical quote is limited to __30__ one-sided pages with a maximum of three pages of tables included. A front and back side of a page will count as two pages. Quotation contents that exceed the stated page limitation will be removed from the quote by the Contracting Officer prior to turning the quote over to the Government evaluation team and will not be considered in the evaluation. Volume 2 does not have a page limitation.</p>
<p>Volume 1<br />Technical Capability<br />Offerors are required to describe their approach or plan to accomplish the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The plan should describe existing capability to meet the PWS task requirements and describe how the offeror will manage and implement effectively the tasks required to accomplish the PWS. Include an overview of the corporate organizational structure in the description and describe roles/responsibilities if any team members or subcontractors are included. Describe the corporate quality control plan and performance measurement approach to cover how performance standards will be monitored, evaluated, and reported. A draft QASP is provided with the solicitation recognizing that the successful Offeror's quality control plan may impact the Government's QASP. The QASP will be finalized within 30 days after award.</p>
<p>Provide a staffing plan describing how the staffing required under the PWS will be filled. The staffing plan should include the timeline from receipt of order to the fill of all positions. The contractor shall describe the education and experience qualifications on the proposed personnel in relation to the personnel requirements in the PWS. Include a resume for the On-site Contract Project Manager (CPM), which is considered a key personnel position. The resume should reflect the ability to perform the complexity of the work required in the PWS. The personnel will be evaluated according to the relevant work experience and qualifications to accomplish the PWS.</p>
<p>The offered capability must present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the PWS with minimal risk to the Government. Lack of specificity or a general offer to perform the PWS may result in a quote being considered unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration for award. Offers are evaluated on the feasibility and completeness of the technical capability to integrate tasking and achieve the PWS with minimal risk to the Government.</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />Offeror's quote shall provide a summary of at least three current or past contracts for the same or similar services, within the last three years. This information should demonstrate how the Offeror has successfully performed work similar to what is described in the PWS. This summary shall also contain sufficient information for the Government to verify contractor past performance and customer satisfaction as follows. <br /><br />1. project title and contract number <br />2. start and end dates <br />3. contract value <br />4. any awards or quality demonstrators of performance achieved<br />5. respective primary Point of Contact for the customer (name, agency or firm affiliation, city and state, phone number and e-mail)</p>
<p>Successful completion of work activities similar in terms of size, complexity, type of work, as well as receipt of awards/recognition and lack of adverse contractual actions, will result in a higher rating than more narrow experience. If an Offeror has no record of relevant past performance or information on performance is not available, the Offeror will receive a "Neutral" rating, which is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has past performance that will enhance its technical capability to perform and whether the offeror consistently delivers quality services in a timely manner. In evaluating past performance, the Government may supplement the information Offerors provide with performance information it may obtain from any source including its own experience with the Offeror and government agency databases.<br /><br />The contractor shall, as part of its proposal, present a high-level transition plan (no more than two pages long) including major milestones for adding resources and transitioning support responsibilities.</p>
<p>Volume 2<br />Price<br />Offerors shall quote a Time and Materials (T&amp;M) or labor hour type of pricing structure. The offer must be priced by year and include a summary for the base period and the option period. For evaluation purposes, the following anticipated distribution of labor hours by labor categories shall be used by offerors in preparing their price quote.</p>

Price quotations shall remain valid for a period of 90 days from the date quotations are due.<br />2) Technical Quotation: The offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the technical quotation. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The technical quotation shall address the following: <br /><br />Technical Capability: The offeror shall submit a technical description or product literature for the equipment it is proposing, which clearly identifies the manufacturer, make and model. The offeror must demonstrate that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the technical specifications by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description or product literature. If applicable, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation should be included.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions: This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>

<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p><strong>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS </strong>- United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>On March 31, 2011, SMC/SY posted this announcement (11-46)&nbsp;notifying industry of its intent to issue a 3 month, sole source extension contract to the incumbent, Mantech. The purpose of the extension was to provide SMC additional time to complete the competitive acquisition for the follow-on contract for this effort.<br /><br />After review with SMC staff, the decision was made to revise the extension to no more than 6 months. The assessment at SMC was that 3 months might not be adequate time to complete the competition. The&nbsp; 6 month extension will begin on May 17, 2011 and will go no longer than November 16, 2011.<br /><br />As mentioned in this posting before, SMC/SY is actively working toward issuing the RFP for the follow-on contract under announcement SMC09-41. There was a draft RFP issued on 28 Jan 2011 for industry comment. A second draft RFP is planned to be released the week of April 25, 2011. Please monitor announcement SMC09-41 for information on the release of the second draft RFP.<br /><br />If you have any questions or comments regarding this&nbsp;revised announcement,&nbsp;please notify the points of contact identified in this notice.

Interested offerors should detail their experience and capability in regards to paving public parking areas.  Also, capabilities in regards to supplying and installing Vault Toilets and Shade Shelters should be addressed in your response.   Bonding capability required will be $3.4 million.
Lower Portal RoadsThis is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns that may be interested in performing the proposed project may submit capability statements for consideration.  Based on the response received to this announcement,  the Government may determine to set this acquisition aside, proceed with an unrestricted solicitation or decide on an alternate procurement strategy.  Proposed Project is as follows:Construction services for repaving approximately 1.4 miles of the Lower Portal Road beginning at the security entry gate (Station 0+00) and ending at the hair pin curve (Station 75+35).  Additional work includes placement of four drainage culverts, drainage ditches and collection basins to collect storm runoff, placement of guardrail for safety, a pullout lane to check brakes at the midpoint, excavation and slope stabilization at blind curves to improve visibility and safety, and a helicopter landing pad at the Overlook (approximately Station 64+50). The principal components of the work are as follows:Pulverize existing bituminous surfacing from the Lower Portal Road (approx 18,500 square yards) and recycle as sub-base material.  Remove and dispose of approximately 900 linear feet of wooden guardrail and replace with galvanized steel guardrail (triple corrugation).  Remove approximately 275 linear feet of existing steel W-beam guardrail.  Salvage and/or recycle removed materials.  Shape, form, and line drainage ditches as required adjacent to the roadway to collect normal run-off from heavy rainstorms.  Install 24-inch corrugated metal pipe drainage culverts with appropriate sized metal flared inlet sections and riprap splash pads.  Upstream area shall include grating to prevent large debris from entering into the storm drain/culvert.  To minimize erosion, downstream end of culvert shall discharge onto a riprap splash pad or an area protected with large native rock.  Import aggregate base course (ABC) in accordance with Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) standard specifications.  Earthwork and excavation to remove rock, reshape embankment, and improve line of sight at blind curves.Interested sources should submit statements showing ability as a prime-level contractor.  The contractor must have sufficient financial and management capability to assure bonding up to $3.4 million. Should you be interested in this requirement, please submit a capability package to Liz Bailey at the email address listed below.

Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type (HUBZone or Service-Disabled veteran small business, etc), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.   Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.  Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.  This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, including whether a HUBzone or Service-Disabled Veteran Small Business set-aside is warranted or if another socio-economic set-aside strategy is more appropriate.  The applicable NAICS Code for this announcement is 237310 - Highway, Street and Bridge Construction.  The Small Business Size Standard is 33.5 Million.
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Liz Bailey LC-10116, Contract Specialist, P. O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail eebailey@usbr.gov.

This Amendment serves to correct the type of action for this announcement.  Solicitation Q1450110014 was erroneously announced as a "Presolicitation Notice/Procurement."  The announcement action should read "Combined Synopsis/Solicitation" as stated in paragraph one "DESCRIPTION" in Solicitation Q1450110014, and constitutes the only solicitation isssued.
All other terms remain in full force and effect.

<DESC>****This is a modification to the previous notice, which originally only included requirements for submarine preservation.  This notice incorporates both HM&E and submarine preservation repairs.****

Norfolk Ship Support Activity, PO Box 215, Portsmouth, VA, 23705-0215, is seeking to identify sources to provide the necessary management, technical services, labor, material, support services and equipment to accomplish a full range of depot level repairs and alterations, troubleshooting, maintenance, installation, and removal of main and auxiliary, hull, mechanical and electrical (HM&E) equipment and systems onboard U.S. Navy and other military ships, submarines, boats and service craft.
  The work will be accomplished on behalf of Norfolk Ship Support Activity (NSSA) onboard U.S. Navy vessels located primarily within a 50-mile radius of Norfolk, Virginia, but may be accomplished worldwide. 
 
Contractors may also be required to perform depot level preservation on USS Naval SSN, SSBN & SSGN Class submarines located at repair depots identified below.  Typical work performed during Depot Maintenance Period (DMP)/Engineered Refueling Overhaul (ERO) availabilities may include Main Ballast Tank blasting, Internal Tank blasting and painting with one hundred percent high solids and non high solids coatings of the bow tank, external and internal sail, free floods, bow dome, areas above the boot top, exterior hull and non-skid removal and installation.
  Typical work to be performed in Selected Restricted Availability (SRA)/Interim Drydocking (IDD) availabilities may include blasting, painting and surface preparations for complete or touch-up preservation of the Main Ballast Tanks, bow tank, internal tank, exterior hull, exterior and internal sail, bow dome and free floods.  Many of the spaces in the ballast tanks require special blasting and painting equipment because of the configuration of the structure and equipment in the tanks.  

Additional work that may be included is handling of sound dampening/Special Hull Treatment (SHT) tiles, the cleaning of sanitary and other tanks, external staging in specifically designated areas to support submarine preservation, general shipboard cleaning, zinc replacement, and lead ballast removal and installation.
  .

NAICS code 336611 applies, with a size standard of 1,000 employees.
 
Potential sources are notified that the Limitations on Subcontracting clause (FAR 52.219-14) will be included in any RFP set aside for small business concerns. 
Interested parties must submit a written expression of interest to the address stated below not later than April 29, 2011.  Specifically address your qualifications or abilities to handle Special Hull Treatment (SHT) tiles.
Sources are also requested to identify any on-going Government contract vehicles they may have for the same or similar work.  Please include the name and number of the on-going contract, contract scope, contract type, period of performance, contract deliverables, dollar thresholds and limitations, the issuing Government agency, and the name and telephone number of the Contracting Officer.
  This contract information should be concise. 

This request is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. 

Forward requested documentation to Mrs. Cynthia Anderson. She may be reached by telephone at (757) 396-5041 ext. 462 or via email at nssa_nrfk_410@navy.mil

<DESC>Introduction:
The United States Postal Service is requesting information to pre-qualify parties interested in providing software engineering services for the Flats Sequencing System (FSS) for the Technology Acquisition Management (TAM) organization at United States Postal Service (USPS) Engineering.  

The FSS is designed to sort flat mail into Delivery Point Sequence (DPS) for the letter carriers of one or more zones through a two-pass sequencing operation.  The USPS has identified the need to be able to maintain, modify and enhance the software. 


General requirements:
The USPS TAM organization seeks to secure a dedicated contract with an organization experienced in the type of engineering support required to maintain the FSS.
The USPS will retain title to all intellectual property developed under contract.  
Sources sought for this effort are those suppliers who have a minimum of four-years experience in the following:
  Experience in FSS system/subsystem software
  Experience in software development languages, including C++, C, and C#
  Experience in Oracle and SQL database development
  Experience in Web Application development
  Experience in PLC development

The main purpose of this effort is to:
  Enhance FSS functionality, maintainability and usability
  Provide adaptive support
  Provide extended system field support
  Provide support in improving current FSS SRS, RTM, SDD and STD
  Provide training and documentation to enhance USPS maintenance capabilities and to support USPS personnel
  Provide knowledge transfer from Vendor to USPS
The ideal supplier will have resources with prior FSS software engineering experience.


Facility Requirements:
Work under the terms of the contract will be performed at the suppliers place of business.


Contract Requirements:
This software maintenance support contract calls for a period of performance (POP) of 2 years, with two one-year options.
The contract will be a time-and-materials contract.  


Submission Requirements:
Interested parties are requested to submit the following information:
  Organization Name

  Contact Email
  Facility Information
  Brief Narrative of Past Performance (With at least two references).  Please include:

     - Status of supplier as prime contractor or subcontractor.

     - Period of performance.
     - Role in the project.
     - Overall scope and complexity of the project, and the relevancy between the supplier's proposal and the referenced contract.  Relevant projects are projects that required similar skills and services.  The projects selected for description should represent the best examples of the supplier's performance experience.
     - Detailed description of the work performed.
     - Discussion of problems encountered and how those problems were resolved.
      - Describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the supplier possesses a high quality process for providing the product or service required.
  Brief Narrative of key personnels experience related to FSS or other relevant equipment maintenance.

A competitive solicitation is planned.  Responses to this notice will be pre-qualified based on the following factors:

Once sources are pre-qualified, a formal solicitation will be issued.
Information must be submitted to Mathew Da Silva at mathew.j.dasilva@usps.gov no later than close of business on April 7, 2011.  Incomplete submissions may be discarded.  Questions prior to the deadline can be addressed to Mathew Da Silva at mathew.j.dasilva@usps.gov or (703)280-7820.


Provisions:
A-2: Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes (March 2006 - Modified)
The Postal Service does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to pay for the information solicited.
This solicitation is issued for the purpose of:
Obtaining market information regarding the availability of software maintenance support services, and to prequalify suppliers in the event a formal solicitation is issued.


Clauses:
4-8: Key Personnel (March 2006) 
To the extent that the statement of work provides for services to be performed by key personnel, those services must be performed by the personnel identified in the suppliers proposal to perform them unless substitutes have been approved in writing by the contracting officer.  Use of junior personnel, even under key personnel supervision (for example, associates or student workers), is not authorized unless they are identified in the suppliers proposal by name or position, with a description of their duties. 
This agreement may be terminated if the key personnel named in the suppliers proposal become unavailable for any reason.  If the unavailability of key personnel is not the fault of the supplier, the contracting officer may terminate by giving notice of termination.  The supplier will be paid for service performed up to the date of termination.  If the contracting officer finds that the supplier is at fault for the unavailability of key personnel, the agreement may be terminated for default.

1.	Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The Department of Veterans Affairs Network VISN 22 Contracting Activity (NCA), 5901 East Seventh Street, Long Beach, CA 90822, has received a requirement to modify VA262-BP-0332, an existing blanket purchase agreement based upon an FSS contract by adding open market line items from the same contractor.

2.	Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  Negotiation shall be conducted to procure a lease with Olympus American Incorporated for these open market items.  Circumstances require that this be done without the benefit of full and open competition.  The proposed contract vehicle shall be a modification to the above mentioned BPA based on Olympus American's current mandatory FSS schedule with a period of up to 3 years.  Total Cost: $480,146.95

3.	Description of Requirement:  This is a supply BPA that currently provides Leased Medical Scopes and Related Equipment for use within VISN 22.  This modification shall add open market incidental items that are necessary for the continued function of new medical scopes added from FSS schedules for the VA Loma Linda and VA San Diego Healthcare Systems.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  This request is pursuant to the authority of FAR Part 8.402(f), and FAR Part 6.302-1(a).

5.	The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:
A.	Under 8.402(f), an ordering activity for convenience, may add items not on the Federal Supply Schedule to a BPA based off of an FSS contract under certain conditions.  1) The add-on must comply with all publicizing and competition requirements of the FAR, including FAR part 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15; 2) the price of these items have been deemed fair and reasonable; 3) the items are clearly labeled as open market items; 4) all clauses applicable to items not on the Federal Supply Schedule are included in the order.  The items as attached addenda are all support items for actual medical scopes which are the primary items within the BPA.  These support/incidental items have been negotiated with the contractor to obtain significant discounts.  In addition, when these items are compared to FSS schedule items of similar quality, they are within the same price range but command a slight premium due to their new features.  Most of these incidental items are new items that have not yet been added to Olympus America's FSS schedule.  Further, these items shall be clearly marked as open market items within the current BPA and all clauses applicable to these items shall be added into the modification.  In the interest of convenience these items should be added to this BPA pursuant to 8.402(f) as they satisfy the above requirements.
B.	FAR Part 6.302-1(a) allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition; applicable when the agency's minimum needs may only be satisfied by a supply or service that is unique and available from only one responsible source.  The equipment being added to this BPA under this modification is required for the proper use and function of these medical scopes.  The medical scopes within this BPA have many proprietary features which require the use of these open market items.  However some companies are able to provide a small portion of these open market items with universal alternatives, though due to standardization requirements outlined within VHA Directive 2009-004 and VHA Handbook 1761.1 it is in the best interest to purchase these items from one manufacturer.   Under VHA Directive 2009-004 and VHA Handbook 1761.1, VHA authority has mandated that standardization of equipment, processes and procedures be implemented immediately to ensure patient safety and health.  In addition, the April 19, 2010 Deputy Undersecretary for Health Operations and Management (DUSHOM)(10N) memo outlines guidance for VHA standardization of Endoscopes (WebCIMS No. 451818).  Purchasing universal alternatives would cause issues with standardization which would also cause issues with cleaning and decontamination of these instruments.  This could cause serious bodily damage and harm as it did in viral outbreak incidents in Tennessee, Georgia and Florida which prompted the creation of the standardization procedures above.  Thus Olympus is the only contractor that can provide the necessary items to meet the needs of VISN 22.

6.	A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  A Notice shall be publicized and synopsized under requirements stated in FAR Part 5.

7.	Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost of this procurement presented by Olympus American, Inc is fair and reasonable to the Government based on using service estimates and previous purchasing history of prices.  In addition, when compared to items of previous generations and like quality that have been deemed fair and reasonable by GSA, these items only command a small price premium of about 10-15% due to their cutting edge technology.

8.	Results of Market Survey: In accordance with FAR Part 10 Market Research, various VA and Federal Supply Contracts were reviewed.  Olympus America is the appropriate distributor of these items to Government Accounts.  Other contractors were found with universal alternatives of some of the items attached, but only Olympus America could provide all of the necessary items needed to fulfill the needs of the VISN.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Items 5 above.

10.	Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that have expressed an interest to date.


11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: This agency will attempt to remove barriers to competition at the expiration of this BPA to promote stronger pricing.  Though, due to the nature of the current BPA and standardization requirements; the addition of these items is necessary to continue services to our veterans.

12.	Requirements Certification: See attached.

13.	Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304
A. I hereby certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (OTFAOC)<br />LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION<br />JA11-029</p>
<p>Justification for OTFAOC Number: (Assigned by the Procurement Activity Competition Advocate (PACA))<br />Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Procurement Activity Competition Advocate, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304c(b)(2), Task and Delivery Order Contracts Multiple Award Contracts, and FAR Part 16.505(b)(2) ii, Exception to the Fair Opportunity Process.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE:</p>
<p>a. Defense Video and Imagery Distribution System (DVIDS)<br />Third US Army, US Army Forces Central Command (ARCENT)<br />3845 Pleasantdale Road<br />Atlanta, GA 30340</p>
<p>b. Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)<br />DISA/DITCO/PL8222<br />2300 East Drive<br />Bldg 3600<br />Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406</p>
<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S): The contracting action is to solicit a proposal through the FCSA (Future Commercial SATCOM Acquisition) strategy which mandated the use of the GSA IT Schedule 70 to provide best value/pricing. This action will be competed among the current GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54 vendors (ARTEL, INC., AMERICOM GOVERNMENT SERVICES, INC., HUGHES NETWORK SYSTEMS, LLC, INTELSAT GENERAL CORPORATION, SEGOVIA, INC. and CAPROCK GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS, INC.). The technical requirement for the acquisition of satellite bandwidth is limited to New Skies (NSS) - 7 (Deleted Text); and Galaxy 17, EchoStar IX, and the AM-22 (SESAT-2) (Deleted Text). The use of the cited satellites and specific transponders are the only technically acceptable solution and proposals must reflect their use.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:</p>
<p>a. This service requirement is needed to maintain the necessary satellite bandwidth for the DVIDS platform. DVIDS is the primary strategic communication platform for Operations Iraqi New Dawn and Enduring Freedom (OND/OEF) and is a critical communications tool for the Overseas Contingency Operations. DVIDS supports OND/OEF by providing the capability to transmit live, manage, coordinate, market, distribute and deliver visual information from Public Affairs, Armed Forces Radio Television Service (AFRTS) and Joint Combat Camera to US and international media outlets. <br />b. Space segment is required for DVIDS to transport broadcast-quality video,<br />2-way data, stories, stills, video, audio and data, from various DVIDS satellite communication (SATCOM) terminal systems (transmitters) worldwide to the DVIDS Operations Hub, currently in Atlanta, GA and subsequently distributed by satellite, fiber, Internet Protocol (IP) or Tape/Digital Video Disk (DVD).</p>
<p>c. (Deleted Text)</p>
<p>d. The resulting task order will be firm-fixed price with a 12 month base period with four 12 month option periods. (Deleted Text)</p>
<p><br />4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY: <br />10 U.S.C. 2304c(b), Task and Delivery Order Contracts-Fair Opportunity Exceptions, FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii), Exception to the Fair Opportunity Process.<br /><br />5. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>a. The Future Commercial SATCOM Acquisition Strategy mandates use of the GSA IT Schedule 70, SIN 132-54. Currently there are six contractors on the SIN; all of which are listed as interested parties and they have the unique qualifications, capabilities to render requested service and performance. (Deleted Text) Therefore, only the NSS-7, Galaxy 17, EchoStar IX, and the AM-22 (SESAT-2) satellites can provide the space segment needed to support this requirement. Any other technical solution would generate unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>(Deleted Text)</p>
<p>6. BEST VALUE DETERMINATION: <br /><br />When using GSA, a price evaluation will be completed by the Contracting Officer and a determination will be made that the order represents the best value to the government. For orders place IAW GSA; GSA has already determined prices of supplies and fixed price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates under their schedules are fair and reasonable therefore no fair and reasonable determination is required when using these schedules.</p>
<p>7. MARKET RESEARCH:</p>
<p>Market research to estimate the costs of using alternate technical solutions included: Internet research, reviewing GSA advantages and comparing existing contract cost information. Other solutions were considered, but the NSS-7, Galaxy 11, EchoStar IX, and the AM-22 (SESAT-2) satellites are the only solutions that can provide the space segment needed to support this requirement. <br /><br />8. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>9. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION:</p>
<p>a. Procurement History.</p>
<p>(1) DISN Satellite Transmission Services - Global (DSTS-G) task order (TO) 410 was awarded previously for this requirement to CapRock Government Solutions.</p>
<p>(2) It was competed among the three DSTS-G vendors (ARTEL, DRS-TSI and CapRock Government Solutions). Fair opportunity was provided to all three vendors.</p>
<p>b. A justification was prepared to support the prior procurement. Market research was done every 12 months to identify alternate technical solutions, but none were found that would not cause an interruption in service.</p>
<p>c. Competition will be obtained since this action will be competed among the current GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54 vendors (ARTEL, INC., AMERICOM GOVERNMENT SERVICES, INC., HUGHES NETWORK SYSTEMS, LLC, INTELSAT GENERAL CORPORATION, SEGOVIA, INC. and CAPROCK GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS, INC.).<br /><br />10. REFERENCE TO THE APPROVED ACQUISITION PLAN (AP) PROGRAM PLAN (PP):</p>
<p>IAW DARS 7.103 (S-90) through 7.104 (S-90) Exceptions: The following acquisitions do not require a Streamlined AP if the total value of the acquisition, including options, is at or below the DFARS AP thresholds. However, these acquisitions do require a Standard AP if the total value of the acquisition, including options, is at or above the DFARS AP thresholds. The total value of this acquisition is below the DFARS AP thresholds.</p>

<DESC>The Nashville District USACE has a requirement for highly specialized services to update the existing finite element analysis model of Chickamauga Lock for the effects of concrete expansion due to alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR), combined with other applicable loads (dead load, post-tensioning, hydrostatic, thermal, etc.). The work will require the Contractor to calibrate the existing model to measured deflections and stresses from existing data survey points, inverted pendulums, growth meters, crack meters, joint meters, slot movement measurements and tendon strain meters and an initial analysis of present structure behavior.  Using the calibrated model, the Contractor shall conduct an analysis with the current lock configuration that evaluates an additional 10 years of AAR effects.
