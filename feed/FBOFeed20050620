<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation announcement.  This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement.  

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement a program described below.  Under a new Strategic Objective Agreement (SOAG) being negotiated between USAID/Bolivia and the Government of Bolivia, USAID will support a triad of partners to strengthen capacity of the decentralized public sector health care system to provide clinical and community-based services in 131 municipalities.  The three partners include the Ministry of Health (through the PROSIN Project), and institutional contractor to strengthen clinical services, and PROCOSI, a Bolivian NGO Network, to provide community-based health.  

In order to ensure that PROCOSI develops the in-house capacities to fully participate within the triad of partners, USAID seeks to put in place a technical assistance contract with the following objectives: 

Objective One: Strengthen the technical capacity of PROCOSI and its members to deliver a standardized package of community-based health interventions:

-	Strengthened technical capacity within PROCOSI to design and implement quality community-based health activities based on best practices, national and international standards
-	Development and implementation of an institutionalized approach for (a) continuous quality improvement (CQI) and (b) program monitoring and evaluation within the PROCOSI network

Objective Two: Strengthen management capacity within the PROCOSI network to improve health program administration and institutional sustainability:

Development and implementation of an institutionalized approach for assessing and strengthening health program management capacity among NGO members of the PROCOSI network

VISION OF SUCCESS - The Mission holds firmly to the principle that local capacity-building is a key development goal and helps promote national ownership and long-term sustainability.  The technical assistance role of the contractor in assisting PROCOSI is viewed as limited and transitional until such time as local capacity is adequate to meet development program needs.  Promoting the transfer and institutionalization of capacity-building and technical assistance skills within PROCOSI will be the measure of success for the contractor’s performance.

RELATIONSHIP WITH PROCOSI – Although the contractor will ultimately be responsible to the USAID Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and Regional Contracting Officer for technical and administrative performance, the short and long-term technical advisers will be located within the PROCOSI central offices in La Paz.  They will serve under the general oversight of PROCOSI’s NGO Umbrella Project Director and will function as integrated team members in support of the technical staff responsible for implementing the Cooperative Agreement.  The contractor’s activity will not be publicly identified as a separate project.

It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), completion type contract will be awarded for implementation of the two priority components specified above.  Implementation will occur over a 3 year period.  USAID/Bolivia encourages qualified Offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  The Mission anticipates issuing the RFP o/a April 29, 2005.  Proposal due date will be May 31, 2005.

<DESC>AmeriCorps&#61611;NCCC SE Region Campus
Charleston, South Carolina
Statement of Work
For
PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS

AmeriCorps*NCCC is a residential national service program operated by the Corporation for National and Community Service.  The AmeriCorps*NCCC mission is to strengthen communities and develop leaders through team-based national and community service.  Built on the legacy of the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, AmeriCorps*NCCC is premised on the belief that civic responsibility is an inherent duty of all citizens and that national service can effectively solve local problems while providing opportunities to learn practical skills and engender a life-long commitment of service to others.  Based on five campuses in Sacramento, CA; Denver, CO; Charleston, SC; Perry Point, MD; and Washington, D.C.; the AmeriCorps*NCCC engages young people ages 18 – 24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.  The Southeast Region Campus is located at 2231 South Hobson Avenue, Charleston, SC 29405 and serves local community projects, as well as projects in 10 states in the southeast region.  In case of disaster relief, members may be sent to other state locations. 

During August and September 2005 approximately 286 members (male and female) will arrive at the Southeast Region Campus with the understanding that each will have to take a physical examination similar to a pre-employment screening upon program entry.  Our program is rigorous with several essential work functions that make it imperative to assess each member’s fitness to perform safely in the program. Therefore, a health care provider is needed to conduct a physical examination on each member.

The physical exams will be conducted during two phases and includes several component parts in addition to a 10 panel drug test and “PPD testing” for tuberculosis. 
 
•	Phase I

On August 3, 2005, 33 team leaders arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination for these members at the provider’s facility on Saturday, August 6, 2005.

•	Phase II

On September 7, 2005, we will have 253 additional members arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination for these members at the provider’s facility on Saturday, September 10, 2005.  We are requesting sufficient medical personnel be provided to insure the adequate, timely processing of approximately 253 members within a 12 hour day.  If some of the examination requirements cannot be provided on-site, the provider may submit alternatives for completing all requirements.

•	In addition, we require the results of the drug testing within 24 hours of the last test. TB PPD skin tests are to be read within 48-72 hours following the application. Medically trained personnel will read and evaluate the members TB skin results.

If Corps Members have medical conditions considered dangerous to their health if left untreated (e.g. previously unknown glucosuria or proteinuria, hypertension, possibility of malignancy, or any other defect that may jeopardize the Corps Member’s health), physicians will inform them orally of the problem and advise them to seek medical attention. The physician will document the findings and notify the NCCC staff liaison.

The requirements of the provider to perform the physical examination process are as follows:

All medical providers (Doctors (M.D.s, D.O.s); Physician Assistants; Nurse Practitioners) performing or overseeing the performance of the physical examinations must have current, appropriate professional licenses to practice medicine.

If Certified Physician Assistants and/or Certified Nurse Practitioners are utilized, an Internal Medicine Physician and/or Family Practitioner must also be on the premises performing or overseeing the performance of the medical examinations.

When the examining physician is of the opposite sex or when a member requests it, same-sex chaperones must be provided (there are significantly more female members than males – it is important that a sufficient number of female chaperones be made available).
 
 
A.	THE SCOPE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS: 
    
•	A medical provider in a private one-on-one session will examine the mouth, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, breasts (females only), abdomen, and/or inguinal hernia/testicular exam (males only) of each member.

•	Dental review  (determine acceptability only)

•	Urine-albumin and sugar (reagent strips)

•	Urine pregnancy tests (all females)

•	Ortho/Neuro (excluding a duck-walk) exam.  Omit Ortho/Neuro exams for pregnant females.

•	Height and weight recording

•	Hair and eye color recording

•	Blood pressure and pulse recording

•	Vision, color vision and depth perception reading and recording

•	Hearing/audiometer (visualize tympanic membrane)

•	Tuberculosis testing (PPD)

•	10 panel drug screening, with GCMS confirmation testing for positive results and a Medical Review Officer (MRO). The drugs to be screened for are:
  
-   Opiate Metabolites
               	            -   Cocaine Metabolites
               	            -   Amphetamines 
               	            -   PCP (Phencyclidine)
               	            -   Cannabis/THC
			-   Benzodiazepines
			-   Barbiturates
			-   Methadone
			-   Methaqualone
			-   Prophyphene 

•	Physician recommendations for follow-up, as needed.


B.  DOCUMENTATION OF FINDINGS:

•	Agency physicians and technicians will document all findings on an agreed upon medical form that will be in the members medical chart to address the component parts of the physical examinations.

•	The physician will document if the examined member has any abnormalities that may preclude him/her from participating in rigorous physical activity and/or performing in the AmeriCorps*NCCC program.   

•	The provider will give the documented charts to AmeriCorps*NCCC Personnel, identified as the AmeriCorps*NCCC Liaison.  

C.	OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PROVIDER  

•	To review the AmeriCorps Medical/Mental Health Information Form on all members prior to the examination. 

•	To come to the campus on Thursday, August 4, 2005 for Phase 1 and Thursday September 8, 2005 for Phase 2 to complete members medical forms and Red Cross medical questionnaires prior to conducting physicals.

•	To follow the prescribed Physical Examination for AmeriCorps*NCCC members.  The physical exam elements will not exceed those mentioned in the scope of work and be consistent for both the team leaders and members.  

•	To ensure injured or acutely ill members receive emergency medical treatment in the event of such emergency during their course of stay at the vendor’s facility, if the exams are not conducted on campus.  After applying measures necessary to sustain life and to reduce the possibility of further injury, the providers’ staff will, if necessary, call an ambulance.  All such cases will be reported immediately to the AmeriCorps*NCCC Liaison. 
 
D.	EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES AND FACILITIES:   

•	The provider will provide all equipment and supplies necessary to perform all services (including patient gowns and drapes).  Regardless of where the physical exam is held, member privacy must be maintained and adequate space must be provided in the performance of all services.

E.	THIRD PARTIES:  

•	It is recognized that some services such as laboratory testing for drug screens may be sub-contracted out by the contractor.  All sub-contracted facilities must be properly credentialed to provide the service. The contractor must include all costs associated with third party examination requirements. 
 
F.	RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES:

There will be two parties to carry out the terms of this procurement.  The parties are:  The medical provider and AmeriCorps*NCCC.

1. The medical provider will ensure the completion of the following components: the examination, the assessment, and all documentation.

The bid must include the bidders Tax/Employer Identification Number (TIN/EIN), DUNN (Dun and Bradstreet) number and proof they are registered in the Business Partner Network Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. You can register in the CCR at the following web site: http:/www.bpn.gov. FAILURE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WILL AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFY YOU.

Register in the Central Contract Registry (CCR)

In order to help centralize information about grant recipients and provide a central location for grant recipients to change organizational information, the government will be using the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) for grant applicants and recipients.  Use of the CCR is to provide one location for applicants and recipients to change information about their organization and enter information on where government payments should be made.  The registry will enable recipients to make a change in one place and one time for all Federal agencies to use.
  
General Information
Organizations should register on how they want to do business.

A separate registration in the CCR may be required if an organization wants to have a single unit conduct business and it has a direct payment flow to that organization, it would require a separate DUNS number specified for that unit (if a different address from the parent organization). If the same address, the organization could use the DUNS + 4 found in the CCR.    For example, a university that wants to have its payment information flow through one central point for grants should register as the entity doing business with the government. This registration would require a specific DUNS number for that business. 

Instructions for Registering
Information for registering in the CCR and online documents can be found at www.ccr.gov.  Before registering applicants and recipients should review the Central Contractor Registration Handbook (March 2003).  In the handbook is a Registration Worksheet.  It is recommended that registrants print this worksheet and gather the needed information prior to starting the online registration process.   The fastest and easiest method to register is by computer.  To register via the computer, click on “Start New Registration.”  Registering in the CCR should be first preparation step in the submission for a grant.  Allow a minimum of 5 days to complete the CCR registration.    Organizations can register independently of submitting a grant application.

Statement of Work
For
PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS

AmeriCorps*NCCC is a residential national service program operated by the Corporation for National and Community Service.  The AmeriCorps*NCCC mission is to strengthen communities and develop leaders through team-based national and community service.  Built on the legacy of the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, AmeriCorps*NCCC is premised on the belief that civic responsibility is an inherent duty of all citizens and that national service can effectively solve local problems while providing opportunities to learn practical skills and engender a life-long commitment of service to others.  Based on five campuses in Sacramento, CA; Denver, CO; Charleston, SC; Perry Point, MD; and Washington, D.C.; the AmeriCorps*NCCC engages young people ages 18 – 24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.  The Southeast Region Campus is located at 2231 South Hobson Avenue, Charleston, SC 29405 and serves local community projects, as well as projects in 10 states in the southeast region.  In case of disaster relief, members may be sent to other state locations. 

During August and September 2005 approximately 286 members (male and female) will arrive at the Southeast Region Campus with the understanding that each will have to take a physical examination similar to a pre-employment screening upon program entry.  Our program is rigorous with several essential work functions that make it imperative to assess each member’s fitness to perform safely in the program. Therefore, a health care provider is needed to conduct a physical examination on each member.

The physical exams will be conducted during two phases and includes several component parts in addition to a 10 panel drug test and “PPD testing” for tuberculosis. 
 
•	Phase I

On August 3, 2005, 33 team leaders arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination for these members at the provider’s facility on Saturday, August 6, 2005.

•	Phase II

On September 7, 2005, we will have 253 additional members arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination for these members at the provider’s facility on Saturday, September 10, 2005.  We are requesting sufficient medical personnel be provided to insure the adequate, timely processing of approximately 253 members within a 12 hour day.  If some of the examination requirements cannot be provided on-site, the provider may submit alternatives for completing all requirements.

•	In addition, we require the results of the drug testing within 24 hours of the last test. TB PPD skin tests are to be read within 48-72 hours following the application. Medically trained personnel will read and evaluate the members TB skin results.

If Corps Members have medical conditions considered dangerous to their health if left untreated (e.g. previously unknown glucosuria or proteinuria, hypertension, possibility of malignancy, or any other defect that may jeopardize the Corps Member’s health), physicians will inform them orally of the problem and advise them to seek medical attention. The physician will document the findings and notify the NCCC staff liaison.

The requirements of the provider to perform the physical examination process are as follows:

All medical providers (Doctors (M.D.s, D.O.s); Physician Assistants; Nurse Practitioners) performing or overseeing the performance of the physical examinations must have current, appropriate professional licenses to practice medicine.

If Certified Physician Assistants and/or Certified Nurse Practitioners are utilized, an Internal Medicine Physician and/or Family Practitioner must also be on the premises performing or overseeing the performance of the medical examinations.

When the examining physician is of the opposite sex or when a member requests it, same-sex chaperones must be provided (there are significantly more female members than males – it is important that a sufficient number of female chaperones be made available).
 
 
A.	THE SCOPE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS: 
    
•	A medical provider in a private one-on-one session will examine the mouth, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, breasts (females only), abdomen, and/or inguinal hernia/testicular exam (males only) of each member.

•	Dental review  (determine acceptability only)

•	Urine-albumin and sugar (reagent strips)

•	Urine pregnancy tests (all females)

•	Ortho/Neuro (excluding a duck-walk) exam.  Omit Ortho/Neuro exams for pregnant females.

•	Height and weight recording

•	Hair and eye color recording

•	Blood pressure and pulse recording

•	Vision, color vision and depth perception reading and recording

•	Hearing/audiometer (visualize tympanic membrane)

•	Tuberculosis testing (PPD)

•	10 panel drug screening, with GCMS confirmation testing for positive results and a Medical Review Officer (MRO). The drugs to be screened for are:
  
-   Opiate Metabolites
               	            -   Cocaine Metabolites
               	            -   Amphetamines 
               	            -   PCP (Phencyclidine)

			-   Benzodiazepines
			-   Barbiturates
			-   Methadone
			-   Methaqualone
			-   Prophyphene 

•	Physician recommendations for follow-up, as needed.


B.  DOCUMENTATION OF FINDINGS:

•	Agency physicians and technicians will document all findings on an agreed upon medical form that will be in the members medical chart to address the component parts of the physical examinations.

•	The physician will document if the examined member has any abnormalities that may preclude him/her from participating in rigorous physical activity and/or performing in the AmeriCorps*NCCC program.   

•	The provider will give the documented charts to AmeriCorps*NCCC Personnel, identified as the AmeriCorps*NCCC Liaison.  

C.	OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PROVIDER  

•	To review the AmeriCorps Medical/Mental Health Information Form on all members prior to the examination. 

•	To come to the campus on Thursday, August 4, 2005 for Phase 1 and Thursday September 8, 2005 for Phase 2 to complete members medical forms and Red Cross medical questionnaires prior to conducting physicals.

•	To follow the prescribed Physical Examination for AmeriCorps*NCCC members.  The physical exam elements will not exceed those mentioned in the scope of work and be consistent for both the team leaders and members.  

•	To ensure injured or acutely ill members receive emergency medical treatment in the event of such emergency during their course of stay at the vendor’s facility, if the exams are not conducted on campus.  After applying measures necessary to sustain life and to reduce the possibility of further injury, the providers’ staff will, if necessary, call an ambulance.  All such cases will be reported immediately to the AmeriCorps*NCCC Liaison. 
 
D.	EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES AND FACILITIES:   

•	The provider will provide all equipment and supplies necessary to perform all services (including patient gowns and drapes).  Regardless of where the physical exam is held, member privacy must be maintained and adequate space must be provided in the performance of all services.

The bid must include the bidders Tax/Employer Identification Number (TIN/EIN), DUNN (Dun and Bradstreet) number and proof they are registered in the Business Partner Network Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. You can register in the CCR at the following web site: http:/www.bpn.gov. FAILURE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WILL AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFY YOU.

Register in the Central Contract Registry (CCR)

In order to help centralize information about grant recipients and provide a central location for grant recipients to change organizational information, the government will be using the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) for grant applicants and recipients.  Use of the CCR is to provide one location for applicants and recipients to change information about their organization and enter information on where government payments should be made.  The registry will enable recipients to make a change in one place and one time for all Federal agencies to use.
  
General Information
Organizations should register on how they want to do business.

A separate registration in the CCR may be required if an organization wants to have a single unit conduct business and it has a direct payment flow to that organization, it would require a separate DUNS number specified for that unit (if a different address from the parent organization). If the same address, the organization could use the DUNS + 4 found in the CCR.    For example, a university that wants to have its payment information flow through one central point for grants should register as the entity doing business with the government. This registration would require a specific DUNS number for that business. 

Instructions for Registering
Information for registering in the CCR and online documents can be found at www.ccr.gov.  Before registering applicants and recipients should review the Central Contractor Registration Handbook (March 2003).  In the handbook is a Registration Worksheet.  It is recommended that registrants print this worksheet and gather the needed information prior to starting the online registration process.   The fastest and easiest method to register is by computer.  To register via the computer, click on “Start New Registration.”  Registering in the CCR should be first preparation step in the submission for a grant.  Allow a minimum of 5 days to complete the CCR registration.    Organizations can register independently of submitting a grant application.

<DESC>ITLE:  DEA TECHNICAL STUDY PARTICIPATION. DESC:  The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to SkyTEM APS, Denmark,  The Neatherlands for Helicopter time-domain electronmagentic survey of Pittsburgh Mine Pool using system with null-position receive and dual dipole moment transmitter in accordance with the statement of work listed below. STATEMENT OF WORK:  Helicopter Time Domain Electromagnetic Survey to Detect Flooded Mines This requisition is for a helicopter time domain electromagnetic survey of three areas in Westmoreland, Washington, and Greene Counties in southwestern Pennsylvania, USA.  A map of the flight areas that shows topographic features, cultural features, and overburden depth can be obtained by contacting Rick Hammack (412) 386-6585; email hammack@netl.doe.gov. The purpose of the survey is to detect and map flooded underground mines that occur at depths ranging from 50 m to 200 m.  The thickness and conductivity of the mine pool conductor is 3 m and 200-1000 mS/m, respectively.  The average conductivity of overlying and underlying layers is estimated to be 20 mS/m.  The surveys will total 450 line kilometers (including replication of every 10th line and tie lines, if needed) and be flown at an interline spacing of 200 meters.  Before being considered for this survey, each respondent must provide forward modeling evidence to show that their system can detect a 3-m thick mine pool with a conductivity of 1000 mS/m (modeled as an infinite conductive layer) beneath 150 m of overburden with an average conductivity of 20 mS/m. The respondent will provide everything needed to conduct the survey including helicopter, pilot, time domain electromagnetic instrument, field crew, and all fuel, supplies, and replacement parts.  The total cost is to include mobilization/demobilization costs plus the cost of ferrying helicopter and equipment from site to site.  The respondent will process selected lines of data acquired each day and provide results to an independent QA/QC reviewer and NETL personnel.  The QA/QC reviewer, NETL personnel, and the airborne contractor will meet daily to discuss changes in instrumental parameters or flight plan that might improve survey results.  When possible, these changes will be implemented by the airborne contractor on the next dayâ€™s flight. One of every ten flight lines will be reflown, either in the same direction to determine repeatability or in the opposite direction to determine spatial consistency. Further, NETL will require that flight lines be reflown when repeated flight lines show that results are not repeatable within an average of 10 pct in rhoa. The comparison is made on altitude corrected data and data must be measured on the same GPS location within a few meters. NETL will not compensate the airborne contractor for flight lines where the acquired data do not meet the requirements.  However, NETL will compensate the airborne contractor for lines with acceptable data that are reflown at NETLâ€™s request. Where available, NETL will provide the airborne contractor with down-hole induction conductivity logs from drill holes in the vicinity of flight areas. The location of drill holes will be supplied so that the airborne contractor can hover at these sites for the purpose of obtaining a priori data for the inversion model and for translation of the model layer resistivities to the geological settings. The airborne contractor will return to a test site close to the base station at each take off and landing to acquire a sounding. These soundings should be repeatable within 10 pct in rhoa when altitude corrected. A high altitude (out of the earthâ€™s effect) sounding shall be made before and after the survey period if the weather permits. The airborne contractor will provide raw survey data to NETL and the QA/QC reviewer in a digital format (eg. a XYZ file or tem files) at the end of each survey day. Processed data is provided for selected lines.  The contractor also will generate layered earth inversions that show the location of the target mine pool to the maximum depth possible.  The layered earth inversions will be provided to NETL no later than 2.5 month after the completion of the survey. This request is considered to be sole source to SKYTem APS.  Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  This award shall be awarded using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This purchase order is to be issued to SkyTEM APS because the vendors product is unique and there is not another similar device.  The SkyTEM helicopter time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) system is believed to be the only TDEM system capable of detecting conductive pools of water within underground coal mines at depths greater than 100 m.  Support for this conclusion comes from forward modeling the response of various airborne TDEM systems to mine pool type targets.  The modeling results indicate that the relatively high noise levels in all commercial systems except SkyTEM will prevent the detection of the mine pool at depths exceeding 100 m. This is because most airborne TDEM systems were developed to detect commercial-size orebodies that are larger, more conductive, and generally deeper than the conductive water in the mine pools of the Pittsburgh Coalbed. For these systems, exploration depth is of more importance than the ability to resolve weak conductors at relatively shallow depths that may have only a 10-fold conductance contrast between the target layer (mine pool) and overlying and underlying layers. Unlike other airborne TDEM systems, the SkyTEM system was developed for groundwater exploration with low-contrast targets and where high resolution in the 0 to 300-m depth range is absolutely essential.  The SkyTEM system has several features that permit higher resolutions to be achieved.  First, the SkyTEM is the only system that uses two dipole moments, a low moment for low-noise data at early times that results in high resolution in the near surface, and a high dipole moment for detection of targets at greater depths.  Second, in the SkyTEM system, the receiver is positioned in a low-field or null position with respect to the transmitter.  This results in less transmitter-induced noise in the receiver and permits earlier time gates with lower noise floors, thereby increasing resolution.  Finally, the SkyTEM uses large amounts of data stacking to further reduce the already low noise levels of the system. In previous research, NETL unsuccessfully attempted to detect mine pools using a helicopter TDEM system with coincident loop transmitter-receiver geometry, the geometry used by all commercial helicopter TDEM systems except SkyTEM. Although numerous factors contributed to the failure of this test, the high noise levels observed in data from the coincident-loop system made resolution of the thin, weakly conductive mine pools impossible.  The current research attempts to correct mistakes made in the initial test and to improve the likelihood of detecting conductive mine pools by using a low-noise system such as SkyTEM. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.  The purchase order shall be awarded on the basis of low cost. The Contracting Officer is Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.  The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. Rick Hammack 412-386-6585, email hammock@netl.doe.gov.  All bids, proposals, or quotations must be received by 5:00 pm Eastern Time, July 7, 2005.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<CONTACT>Debra Zamarron (760) 939-9658 Doreen Robbins, (760) 939-9665, doreen.robbins@navy.mil
<DESC>Responses to this Broad Agency Announcement are sought to explore the development and demonstration of nonacoustic sensor and source system/subsystem technology to support the future operational fielding of such systems appropriate for Naval applications for situational awareness in support of SEA STRIKE and SEA SHIELD.  The Navy wishes to identify and explore nonacoustic sensor and source system/subsystem technology issues in the general areas of Laser Technology, Optical Sensors, and Underwater Optical Propagation.  Nonacoustic sensor or source system/subsystem developers and other qualified offerors are invited to submit proposals for the development and demonstration of nonacoustic sensor and source technology that will provide system/subsystem capabilities that will lead to an end-to-end sensing and communication system for Naval deployment. Proposal topic areas of specific interest in this BAA include but are not limited to the following:  1.  Laser Technology.  The objectives of this area are to develop all components required to construct a blue laser capable of operation underwater and on airborne platforms.  The wavelength range of interest is 470 to 496 nm.  Special attention should be given to power/weight, volume and overall efficiency of operation.  A pulse-repetition-frequency (PRF) of 700 Hz or greater is desirable for Laser Infrared Detection and Ranging System (LIDAR) /Laser Detection and Ranging System (LADAR) applications, however, other applications may require significantly lower PRF's . A pulse width of 10-18 ns is generally desired for LIDAR/LADAR applications; however, pulse widths of several hundred picoseconds or less are also of interest.  High average power,  20 W or greater with high beam quality, M2, of  2.0  or less are desired. Emphasis should be placed on designs that explicitly support manufacturability and life cycle cost as well as acquisition cost reliability, and system power e! fficiency.  The payoffs will be blue lasers to support multiple Navy underwater-related missions and a more robust industrial base to support other nonacoustic sensor programs.  Although the primary focus of this portion of the BAA is the development of blue laser sources, designs capable of providing significant performance at multiple wavelengths (blue, green, red) are also encouraged.    2.  Optical Sensors. The objectives of this area are to develop the optical sensors/receivers that will support the other technology areas described within this document.  High optical to electrical conversion efficiency, increased S/N (high dynamic range), low-cost, and manufacturability will be emphasized.  Optical receivers with high bandwidth (>0.5GHz) and large active area (>1cm) are also desired. The payoffs are new optical sensors that will provide increased performance in the littoral and deep-water environments. 3.  Underwater Optical Propagation Modeling.  The objective of this area is to develop theoretical modeling techniques to predict the effect of environmental (water optical properties, water depth, sea surface characteristics), system (transmitter/receiver properties) and underwater object (size, shape, reflectivity, depth) characteristics on the performance of various underwater systems, including optical communication, LIDAR/LADAR, and optical imaging systems. These models and tools will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of new approaches relative to existing techniques in terms of signal-to-noise, detection range, resolution (spatial and temporal), and other mission-specific performance criteria. The payoffs will be a significantly enhanced capability to determine the benefits and limitations of new and existing optical sensors. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102 (d)(2). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP)/ Solicitation, will not be issued. The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD) will not issue paper copies of this BAA. NAWCWD reserves the right to select for award, all, some of none of the Proposals in response to this BAA. NAWCWD reserves  the right to fund all, some, or none of the Proposals received under this BAA.  NAWCWD provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.

Per FAR 35.016(e), the primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical merit, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent possible. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria in descending order of importance with items 4, 5 and 6 being equal: 1. The overall applicability to the Navy's mission and the suitability of approach presented for the selected a non-acoustic sensor, source, or system. 2. The technical merits of the proposed approach and its contribution to the Navy non-acoustic sensor/source system technology base. 3. The offerors capabilities, related experience and facilities or unique combinations of these qualities that are integral factors for achieving the proposed objective(s). 4. The qualification and experience of the offeror's principal investigator, and of the team's key personnel, who are critical in achieving the proposal objective(s). 5. The offerors' record of performance in nonacoustic sensor/source system/subsystem technology or directly related fields. 6. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any, and the availability of funds. Upon receipt of a proposal, the NAWCWD evaluators will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Navy's mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort. Each proposal will be evaluated as it relates to the overall Navy non-acoustic sensor and source program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area. Proposals not considered having sufficient scientific merit and/or relevance to the Navy's needs or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available may be declined without further review  NAICS Code = 334511, 750 employees Place of Performance = N/A Set Aside = N/A

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number RFQ-05-4389-03 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that  are in effect through FAC 2005-04.   The NAICS code is 334516.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  Item description : GENERAL DESCRIPTION of Liquid Chromatography System for Protein Purification: Flow rate range 0.01-100 ml or greater and 1450 psi pressure.  Because of the resolution we require the use of very precise, shallow gradients, the system must be a two-pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing, as evidence suggests that this configuration produces the highest accuracy and precision in gradient formation.  The system must come supplied with a 0.6 ml or smaller interchangeable mixing chamber and have option of a 2 ml or greater chamber for gradients at higher or smaller flow rates.  Because we will be using salt buffers, the entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides.  The pump heads must be titanium with valves and tubing PEEK.  The system pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low-Pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography and other techniques.  The controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based.  The system should include the option of a fraction collector that is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software.  The fraction collector must be able to collect in 18 mm tubes or 12 mm tubes.  The system must include 1 motorized seven port valve with load, inject and wash positions.  The valve should be driven electronically and require no external air or pressure to operate.  The system controller must allow the user to be entering details of the next purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs.  The software must allow complete manual control of all parameters and running conditions while running a method.  Control of motorized valves, fraction collector, dynamic gradient mixer, and autosampler must all be possible from the system controller.  The pumps, UV monitor, valves and fraction collector must all be specified for use in a cold room at 4 degrees C.  The controller must be able to accept seven input signals (e.g. 3 UV wavelengths, conductivity, pH, temperature, and pressure).  It must be capable of plotting, and integrating these signals, as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a preset threshold, to allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations.  The system controller should allow for automation of the optimization of separation parameters (e.g. sample volume, flow rate, gradient slope).  This should allow a small amount of sample to be consumed in optimizing the purification scheme, after which the best regime can be scaled up on the same LC system.  The UV monitor must be able to monitor 3 UV wavelengths simultaneously in the wavelength range of 190-700nm.   Access to the software must be by user name with password and level of access by each user must be definable by administrator.  The software must be able to operate on the Windows X1 operating system.  Post-run chromatographic analysis and reporting functions should also be included.  In order to protect our columns, the system must have a definable pressure limit system defined when the column is select4ed from a list which will stop the pump and generate an audible and visual warning, in the event pressure exceeds the preset limit.  The controller should permit automatic running of up to25 different chromatographic programs in a user-designated sequence.  It must turn off the pump flow when a signal is received from the fraction collector indicating there are no tubes remaining, so that valuable sample is preserved.  The system must automatically and continuously be able to record throughout each chromatographic run the following parameters: flow rate; 3 auto-scaled UV signals; actual system pressure; accumulated time and volume of run ; all valve positions and changes in position; activity of a fraction collector.  It must allow for post-run analysis of chromatograms, export of data to other spreadsheet programs, and generation of written reports.  Installation and training must be provided by the vendor.  The system quoted should include spare parts we are likely to need during the first 12 months of operation. .  Payment under this contract will be made by electronic funds transfer.  Successful offeror must accept government purchase card or be set up with USDA vendor express program at the time invoice is submitted.  Delivery is required within 8 weeks ARO  Delivery is FOB Destination to USDA, ARS, Byron, GA.  Descriptive literature showing the quoted item meets or exceeds all specifications included herein must accompany the quotation.  The government anticipates award or a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsive/responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most price advantageous to the government.  The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial items, applies to this acquisition.  The contracting officer will make award based on price and price-related factors.  Offeror MUST be registered in CCR (www.ccr.gov). Offeror MUST have it Representations and Certification in ORCA (http://orca.bpn.gov).  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial items, applies to this acquisition.  The following FAR clauses cited in 52.212-5 are applicable to this acquisition: 52-203-6; 52.203-10; 52/219-8; 52.222-26; 52.222-35; 52.222-36; 52-222-37; 52.225-3; 52.222-18; 52.225-21.  The contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government.  Acceptance of the standard commercial warranty does not waive the Government’s rights under the Inspection clause nor does it limit the Governments’s rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.  In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the standard commercial warranty.  The contractor shall provide a copy of its standard commercial warranty (if applicable) with its response.  Responses are 25 days from the date this notice is published in the CBD by 4:00 PM local time, July 15, 2005 at USDA Agricultural Research Service, 2316 Rainwater Rd, Tifton, GA 31794 (or POB 748, Tifton, GA 31793).

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price contract to RDR, Inc. for the upgrade, modifications, refurbishment, and development of the LSD-41 Class Training Systems, Device 19H5. The trainer is located at Surface Warfare Officers Schools Command, Newport, RI.  RDR will be responsible for the hardware upgrade, software upgrade, software changes, and software development. This sole source award is based on FAR part 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. Anticipated award date is end of July. 

Currently, RDR is responsible for the upgrade and modification of the LSD-41 MPCS Operator Trainer, Device 19H4 trainer located at Training Support Center, Great Lakes, IL. The required upgrade and modifications are very similar for the 19H5 and 19H4 trainers. Upgrades and modifications include both hardware and software components. RDR has the experience and knowledge from 19H4 to perform the tasks without any risk to the government. If any other contractor was used to perform the tasks, then there will be a substantial duplication of cost because of learning curve factors. Any delay in the performance schedule will not meet the current ready for training date for the school house. Training reschedules will incur additional cost and risk for the government. Due to the need to make these upgrades and modifications in the shortest time possible, RDR has the most intimate knowledge and personnel asset to achieve this goal. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information and technical capability statement in response to this notice. Navair Orlando Contracts shall consider all response. Proprietary data in the response will be protected where so designated. Any questions about this notice, please contact Mr. Jun ji, code 25331 at 407-380-4020 or jun.ji@navy.mil. All other contractor interested in subcontracting opportunities must contract RDR, Inc.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Lance Drennan, Contract Specialist, (973)724-6633
<DESC>Thde sysnopsis as originally submitted expired prior to the release of the  solicitation as numbered W15QKN-05-T-0513.  The solicitation number has been  changed from W15QKN-05-T-0513   to W15QKN-05-T-0720, as outlined below. Description:           The Government, RDEC-ARDEC, located at Picatinny, NJ 07806 intends to  solicit  for the following commercial item, a Precision High Speed Fuze Spin Stand  (â€œspin standâ€). The scope of this effort is to provide upgrades, modifications, and enhancements as well as process prove out for new and existing fuzes.  The  Spin Stand will be used to test the safe and arming and related actions of fuze  components in support of research and development efforts.  The Contractor shall deliver the following equipment (Fuze Spin Stand) in  accordance with the listed specifications.  i.	Spin rates controllable up to 100, 000 revolution per minute (RPM) inclusive, for small caliber test specimens.  â€œSmall caliberâ€ refers to test  specimens of up to 16 grams. ii.	Spin rates controllable of up to 30,000 RPM inclusive, for large  caliber test specimens, up to 3 pounds. iii.	Acceleration time to test speed to be â€œas quickly as practical.  During gun launch, acceleration from zero to full speed occurs within the order of 0.1 seconds.  Understanding that it is highly unlikely to meet this rate in a  mechanical system, this RFQ does not set a specific requirement threshold.  As such, proposals will be evaluated on maximum acceleration, without being disqualified for not meeting â€œgun launchâ€ rates.  Any offeror who chooses to  include any type of expendable clutch element for high-acceleration test modes, must include a minimum of ten (10) sets of replacement hardware. iv.	All spinning elements shall be mechanically shielded for safety. Offeror shall provide details regarding shield material, thickness, and capability to contain catastrophic failure of test specimen. v.	All removable shields shall include interlocks to avoid operation when  not in use. vi.	Spindle shall provide electrical connection from test specimen to  outside instrumentation, via minimum of 12 independent slip rings or similar  contact configuration. vii.	Spindle vibration control and/or damping â€“ Offeror shall provide design details describing methodology used to ensure that system is capable of controlling vibration and adequately addressing vibration & balance problems throughout the entire range of spin rates.  Because of the inherent nature of  fuzing design, which typically employs the movement of components with respect to the axis of rotation and also the center of mass, it must be assumed that test specimens will be off-balance to some degree during normal operation, by design (i.e., off-center mass is typically used to react to spin and activate various elements of a fuze.  Also, it can be expected that center of balance may change slightly during normal sequence of operation (i.e., movement of a weighted rotor or similar component driven by spin). viii.	Precision tachometer with digital readout, to display rotational speed in terms of RPM, including a chronographic capability to display & record elapsed time.  Offeror shall provide design details with regard to methodology of sensing, transmitting, interpreting and recording rotational speed. Optional  Instrumentation â€“ Proposals may be evaluated on the basis of optional equipment and the ability to install at a later date, that may be available, and described within proposal, without obligation or commitment to purchase said optional equipment as part of this solicitation as follows: i	High-speed/high-resolution video recording equipment, including related processing software & hardware, including synchronization with rotational speed.  Offeror shall provide design details, specifically regarding accuracy of the system and synchronization methodology, actual frames per second rates of camera(s) as well as any higher synthetic frames per second rates, and details as to computer/data processing methodology used to generate any such higher rates. ii	Visual image system including any appropriate analysis software & hardware, useful to observe moving parts, and also provide dynamic stress analysis types of data.  Offeror shall provide design details, and specific capabilities of any such analytical system available as optional equipment for subject spin stand. iii	Any additional instrumentation arrangements that would be useful in analyzing fuze components operating in high-spin environment. Contractor shall provide operational manuals for delivered equipment. Contractor is not required to submit drawings. Contractor may provide maintenance plan (parts and labor) for years beyond warranty.  The maintenance plan for the out years will be listed as Option Clins in the subsequent award document. 	Contractor shall be responsible for providing training on, delivery, and installation of equipment (minimum 2 visits per year to verify if parts appear worn and need replacement or repair). Contractor shall warrant all parts and labor for one full year after the date  of installation.  Inspection and acceptance shall be F.O.B. destination. The Statement of Work, Evaluation Factors, and Submission Instructions should be released on PROCNET with solicitation on or about 15 days from this notice. The contractor shall ship the equipment to a location to be determined as specified by the Government. The POCâ€™s on this action are Lance P.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 031 (12 MAY 05) - Draft RFP The PRV Flight has issued a draft RFP for SDD and initial Production efforts  for industry review and comment.  Please provide review comments to ASC/LUH no  later than 26 May 2005. Current plans are to provide for face to face  discussions of contractor comments during the week of 6 June 2005.  Please  contact the individuals listed below to establish date for discussions. Additional data will be provided as it becomes available for release  (ie.  DD254, Sections L+M, and data items).  The SRD, Training SRD, ISP, and SCG should be requested from Mr. Emil DeMusz,  or Mr. Don Fisher. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt  Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD  An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3,  dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<CONTACT>JEAN SCHILLING CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3032369329     jschilli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>Concerns having the ability to complete the state-of-the-art CISN (California Integrated Seismic Network) display system and integrate the CISN display into the ANSS (Advanced National Seismic System) earthquake notification system are requested to provide written notification (including telephone and point of contact) to the procuring office above.   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), ANSS has a requirement to integrate the CISN display into the ANSS earthquake monitoring system which currently operates using seismic data loggers manufactured by Reftek, Guralp, Nanometrics, and Kinemetrics.  ANSS is using SeisNetWatch (SNW) to monitor these data loggers.  The purpose of the requirement is to develop software "agents" for SNW so that ANSS networks can use SNW to detect all data loggers that are not operating within specifications.  SNW was developed by Instrumental Software Technologies, Inc. (ISTI) and has placed the source code in the public domain but is intimately familiar with the software.  EIDS and CISN Display were developed for CISN by ISTI.  CISN has not made the source code publicly available, but has made it available to ANSS.  The source would also have to be familiar with Earthworm modules to port Earthworm to Linux and to perform the Earthworm support.  ISTI meets this requirement because they have developed a large number of Earthworm programs and have configured and installed it at many networks worldwide.  ISTI is the developer of SeisNetWatch Q330 Agent, SeisNetWatch SNWMapclient and QUASAR programming toolkit and currently the only support source.  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(2), (¿.the existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes;¿..) the Government considers the item specified as a sole source from ISTI, New Paltz, NY and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Concerns who feel that they can furnish the required item or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials that correspond to the required items to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  No solicitation document exists, therefore, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. .

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Conservation Training Center (NCTC) located in Shepherdstown, WV is submitting this Request for Information in an effort to find vendors that are capable of providing a shuttle bus service for our guests between the Washington Dulles Airport and NCTC.  The NCTC is located approximately 51 miles (1 hr 14 minutes) from Washington Dulles Airport (IAD).  The campus is a full-service training and residential facility located on 538 acres along the Potomac River, just north of Shepherdstown, West Virginia.  The NCTC is interested in a turn-key solution in which a commuting service provides both the shuttle bus and drivers.  The passengers would make reservations and payment directly to the commuting service.  Recommendations for an alternative solution will be considered.  The NCTC currently shuttles approximately 3,600 one-way or 1,800 round-trip of NCTC guest's per year.   There is also a contract agreement between the NCTC and the Clarion Hotel located in Shepherdstown.  In order for both parties to maximize the space of a shuttle and offset individual operating costs, the NCTC also currently provides shuttle service for the Office of Personnel Managements (OPM) students.  This adds approximately 650 individual's one-way or 325 round-trip a year to the NCTC guest's numbers.  The majority of NCTC's training sessions are 5-day, starting on Monday and ending at mid-day on Friday.  Therefore, the majority of shuttle runs are to bring the guests to NCTC on Sunday and return them on Friday.  This is adjusted when a holiday falls on Monday.  Shuttle service is also adjusted or suspended during other holidays.  Calendar schedules are made a year in advance of pending alterations due to holidays and training schedules.  The current Commuting Service schedule is: Departure	NCTC	NCTC	Clarion	Clarion Friday		1:30 pm	4:30 pm	6:30 am	9:30 am Arrival  		NCTC and Clarion	 Sunday		1:00 pm	4:00 pm	7:00 pm Holiday		NCTC and Clarion		Clarion Monday		1:00 pm	4:00 pm	7:00 pm	 Tuesday					                      10:00 am This Request For Information is for market research purposes only.  No solicitation document is available.  Firms capable of providing these services may express their interest no later than July 18, 2005 by submitting the following information by e-mail to jerry_perry@fws.gov or to Jerry Perry, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Conservation Training Center, 698 Conservation Way, Shepherdstown, WV 25443: 1) a description of the services offered by your firm; 2) a description of the shuttle buses available; 3) commercially available pricing information.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS).  The HSG/ASK, Brooks City-Base TX is seeking sources for a requirement to acquire coherent, technically consistent, engineering and manufacturing development support that will enhance the survivability of aircrew members through improved performance, maintainability, and availability of the Advanced Concept Ejection Seat II (ACES II) family of ejection seat. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR ANY ITEMS/SERVICES FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  The principal goals of this effort are to develop and qualify modification improvements that will keep pace with aircraft operational mission requirements, and address aircrew safety issues associated with high-speed/high altitude operating environments.  Additionally, this effort will allow for an increase in ejection seat capability to support an extended ejection envelope for altitude and speed, and an improved maintainability capability that significantly reduces ejection seat maintenance downtime, resulting in increased aircraft operational availability.  The out come of this effort will be the development of modification kit(s) that can then be openly competed for production.  The respondent will develop, design, and build prototypes test articles that will demonstrate that a field-level modification kit can be retrofitted to existing ACES II ejection seats.  The respondent shall furnish all plant facilities, labor, equipment, special tools, test equipment, and materials. Government drawings, tooling, and facilities to manufacture these kits are not available. The resulting contract will cover all engineering, manufacturing, qualification testing on applicable sub-systems, integration, and any necessary development testing associated with improving the operation and maintenance of the ACES II ejection seat.  This will be accomplished by incorporating controllable propulsion subsystems to optimize terrain clearance during the ejection sequence, upgrading ejection seat sequencing and sensing subsystems for safer/faster/more reliable operation, and allowing the ACES II ejection seat to be removed from its crew station without the requirement to remove the aircraft canopy/hatch, which will significantly increase aircraft availability.  Additionally, this contract will address improving the ability to eliminate/mitigate limb flailing during high-speed ejection, and optimizing aircrew accommodation improvements for better access to aircraft controls and improved body position for aircraft operation and ejection.  This contract will cover all engineering and manufacturing efforts required in support of trade studies, preliminary designs, final designs, and design verification to determine the merits of the services described above.  Formal responses to this SSS should also detail the experience, capabilities, and rights to proprietary drawings, as briefly outlined above, to the Government.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR ANY ITEMS/SERVICES FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  PLEASE NOTE THAT TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources and no-cost product samples of commercially available spacer fabrics or meshes or narrows.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
Spacer fabric/meshes/narrows are sought to enable rapid inflation of garment bladders even under heavy compression, such as that from harnesses, load bearing straps, body folds, and seated weight. Narrows are preferred. Air flow under 10.0 PSI compression should be at least 80% of the uncompressed airflow.  Spacer fabrics/meshes/narrows should be between 0.13 to 0.26 inches thick initially; 0.020 to 0.040 during 1-minute compressions of 10.0 pounds per square inch, and 0.10 to 0.23 inches thick after five compression cycles. A compression cycle shall consist of 1 minute of compression at 10.0 PSI and five minutes of recovery. Spacer fabric/meshes should have high air permeability with a minimum of 500 cubic feet per minute.  High heat and flame resistance is desirable but mandatory. The fabric/mesh/narrow should be dimensionally stable after home laundering (hot cycle) and during hot storage conditions. Hot storage conditions shall be simulated by exposing a 24 by 24 inch sample for 30 minutes at 200 degrees F + 5 deg F with 12 hours cooling time. After exposure, the fabric should have shrunk no more than 4.0% in the warp and 2.0% in the fill. Fabrics and meshes should be 45 inches wide and be able to be cut with sharp blades into 1.5-inch widths and maintain that width during routine cut/sew operations without unraveling more than 1/16 inch from each cut edge. Narrows should have a finished width of 1 to 1.5 inches.  Fabric/meshes/narrows should have soft edges that will not abrade or puncture the bladder fabric. Fabrics/meshes/narrows should be flexible, bendable, and pliable so that body movements are not limited.  


This announcement is neither a Request for Quote/Proposal, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information/items submitted in response to this synopsis.  Any qualified sources may be listed on Source Control Drawings for such items as military anti-G suits, ventilation garments, and life preservers. Product samples and related data are to be shipped to NAWCAD contracts office no later than 30 days after the post date of this synopsis. Interested sources should send the product samples and related data to DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, AIRCRAFT SUPPORT CONTRACTS DEPARMTNET (AIR 2.5.1.3), ATTN: Lisa Wilson, Code 2.5.1.3.2.5, 21983 Bundy Road Unit 7 Bldg 441, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127. Written responses should be submitted no later than 30 days after the date of this synopsis and reference this synopsis number on both the mailing envelope as well as on all enclosed documents. Interested sources shall state company size. Please address all technical questions to Wendy Todd, (301) 342-9224. One-yard product samples and specification sheets will be required from all interested sources at no cost to the Government. Proprietary data MUST be marked on a page-by-page basis, and will be kept confidential and protected where so designated. Interested sources shall state whether their sample is available commercially, minimum yardage required for purchase, cost per yard and lead-time.  Data and samples WILL NOT be returned. This synopsis does not commit the Government to awarding a contract.  This synopsis is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be published separately on the Federal Business Opportunities website.

<DESC>The Ground Combat Sensor Systems Division of the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Ft. Belvoir, VA anticipates soliciting for multispectral aided target recognition/identification (AiTR) algorithms in an Advanced Technology Obj ective  Development (ATO(D)) as a new start in FY06.  The intent of the three year ATO(D) is to develop the algorithms necessary for the detection and identification of ground and air  targets currently performed by human operators.  The algorithm will us e imagery produced from a new multispectral imaging sensor being developed by NVESD.  The sensor will utilize 3rd generation multispectral 640 x 480 staring focal plane array sensitive to both the 3um  5um mid-wave infrared (MWIR) portion of the electroma gnetic spectrum, as well as the 8um  12um long wave infrared (LWIR) portion of the spectrum.  Specific responses are requested as follows: 1.)  The purpose of this market survey is to survey potential industry and academia sources for candidate simultaneous multispectral and multispectral/shape-based AiTR algorithms.  Respondents are to provide white papers describing their algorithm.  The pa per shall discuss the mathematical underpinnings of the algorithm.  The paper shall discuss relevant lab or field demonstrations with supporting data quantifying the algorithms performance, to include probability of detection, probability of identificatio n, false alarm rates, and range performance.  Respondents are asked to discuss the number of pixels on target the algorithm requires in order to perform target detection, recognition and identification.   2.)  It is anticipated that the algorithm will be a part of a larger system software design required to detect and identify a variety of military ground and airborne targets, both static and moving, while the host platform is both static and moving.  Human  targets may be detected as well.  The system will be able to operate while residing on both ground and airborne host platforms in tactical situations, in a variety of environments, under a wide variety of clutter conditions.  The system is expected to be able to support multiple target detection and identification within a field of regard in under 10 seconds.  Multiple targets are to be detected, tracked, and identified.  Once targets are located and recognized, smaller image subsets will to be generated f or operator review and network dissemination.  Respondents are to discuss impacts of this larger system on the AiTR algorithms integration and performance. 3.)  Rapid wide area search, with extended fields of regard as large as 360 degrees wide by 9 degrees high, will be an integral part of the future system.  The algorithm may require fusion with range information such as range maps or DTED data.  Any additi onal image enhancement techniques, such as local area enhancement, histogram equalization, for example, may be required.  Respondents are to discuss the specific impacts of such proposed system characteristics on their AiTR algorithm. The Project Leader is Timothy Watts. Mr. Watts can be reached via email at Timothy.Watts@us.army.mil or by phone, 703-704-1356. The Contracting Officer POC is Ms. Julianne Magee. Ms. Magee can be reached via email at Julianne.Magee@mail1.monmouth.army.mil or by phone, 732-427-1499.

<SUBJECT>M -- Teaming Opportunity to Respond to RFP for Operating Contract for the DHS National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is seeking partners who may be interested in teaming for the operation of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC), a facility to be constructed by the DHS at the US Army Fort Detrick, MD site.  The US Army has released a draft RFP for comment, for the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center operating contract, reference Federal Business Opportunity Special Notice USA-SNOTE-050531-006, released May 31, 2005, or http://www-usamraa.army.mil/pages/index.cfm.  

Sandia is one of the nation’s largest research and development facilities.  A Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory, Sandia’s programs support DOE and the U.S. national security needs of many other federal agencies—including the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Justice, Transportation, EPA, and others. The organization’s technical programs range from basic scientific research to manufacturing operations with a particular emphasis on the development and deployment of robust, engineered systems solutions to problems of core national interest.  

Sandia is a major participant in DHS science and technology programs addressing biological national security issues.  Of direct importance to NBACC objectives is Sandia’s technical expertise (and supporting facilities) in biological science, analytical and bioanalytical chemistry, aerosol science and technology, advanced bioanalytical systems development and application, and systems analysis. Supporting capabilities in microsystems research and development, high-performance computing, biological countermeasures systems development, biodefense systems engineering, and work in international monitoring programs are also relevant to the NBACC mission.

For more than a decade, Sandia has been heavily involved in the analysis of biodefense options and in the development and deployment of biological countermeasures technologies and systems. The work at Sandia touches on all aspects of this issue from detection of proliferant activities to the deployment of warning and response systems in urban settings to the decontamination and restoration to operation of contaminated facilities. Scientific efforts range from fundamental research into the mechanisms of virulence to bioforensic casework arising from the anthrax releases of the Fall of 2001. The work is principally focused on the threat of use of such agents against civilian populations and venues, but efforts to address the problem of protecting military forces and installations are also a significant part of our activity.

Sandia is interested in providing the technical capabilities described above in partnership with one or more parties having an interest in providing the operational and management expertise in response to the NBACC RFP.  Sandia is specifically interested in teaming with an entity or entities with significant capabilities or experience in managing facilities similar to the NBACC, management of FFRDCS, management of classified facilities, management of biological laboratories and biocontainment facilities, experience working with DHS and DoD, and capabilities to provide the infrastructure to manage NBACC operational requirements.  Sandia is especially interested in a teaming arrangement in which Sandia would play a leadership role in managing and conducting the scientific and technical programs including the development and transition to products of technologies to achieve the objectives of the NBACC.

Interested parties should contact Teresa Montoya, FBO Administration by phone (505) 844-7522 or email at tmontoy@sandia.gov, no later than July 22, 2005.  Responders are asked to provide:  1) A current annual business/financial report, 2) a description of the responder's desired role, and Sandia’s expected role, in a management team for the operation of NBACC, and 3) a description of the responder's capabilities and expertise related to:
a)	management of FFRDCS
b)	management of classified facilities
c)	management of biological laboratories/biocontainment facilities at or above the BSL2 level
d)	experience working with DHS and DoD
e)	excellence in business operations, i.e., financial operations, reporting, QA/QC, human resources, procurement and property management, safety and environmental responsibility, and legal functions, etc.

Sandia National Laboratories is a government-owned-contractor-operated facility operated by Sandia Corporation, a subsidiary of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Management and Operating (M&O) Contract DE-ACO4-94AL85000. As an FFRDC, Sandia is bound by Federal Acquisition Regulations and .DOE requirements.  Sandia's capabilities are available to parties interested in responding to the DHS NBACC RFP, subject to complementary interests with Sandia. 

Sandia reserves the right to decline to submit a proposal in response to the final RFP for the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center.

<SUBJECT>F -- fire/ fuels data elements evaluation
<DESC>The USDA Forest Service intends to perform a sole source procurement with Mr. Travis Emery in order to develop a methodology for the evaluation of regional fire/ fuels data elements; to assess vegetative homogeneity and classification across an analysis area or wildland urban interface (WUI) treatment area.  
 
This evaluation is necessary to evaluate various methods of creating vegetation polygon layers consistent with USDA Forest Service classification guidelines and to determine when a vegetation layer has deteriorated to a point where a new delineation or classification is required across the landscape.

This spatial analysis methodology will be used to evaluate the homogeneity of the vegetation in each polygon, and will be incorporated into the current fire spatial modeling data input layers throughout the southwestern region. 

This methodology will be compatible with the current Natural Resources Information System (NRIS) - Integrated Forest Management System (INFORMS) Fire/Fuels analysis technology.  An application for use will be distributed and deployed throughout the region, particularly in high-risk areas where very accurate and detailed fire spatial data input layers are needed to assist in the pre-positioning of fire suppression resources and the prioritization of fuel treatment areas within the identified high-priority WUI areas.

The completed product should run on UNIX or Linux computers and will be developed in either a platform-independent scripting language or C++. In addition, the application should categorize each polygon for homogeneity and report an overall homogeneity score for the entire analysis area, which is usually a large continuous landscape or National Forest.

The person must have the following MINIMUM educational requirements: (list education), the following experience (list experience), following training (list training) and must have working knowledge of the following requlations (list regs).

Minimum education requirements:

Must have a BS with related course work in Biology, Statistics, Computer Science and Ecology.

Minimum experience requirements:

Must have a comprehensive background in field data collection, procedures, protocols, and corporate databases associated with USDA Forest Service.

Must have a comprehensive understanding of the various model application associated with the data analysis and processing tools affiliated with the data elements collected in the field  (i.e. Integrated Forest Management System, Most Similar Neighbor Analysis & GIS Modeling Interfaces).

Must have existing experience in statistical data analysis associated with field sampled vegetation data relating to fire/fuels management and proven track record of managing multiple projects in a professional, timely manner with minimal supervision.


Minimum training requirements:

Common Stand Exam (CSE)
FSVEG (Field Sampled Vegetation)

The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations. 

The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) is within the DRM Division and was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response mechanism.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, HSTS03-05-R-CAO071 (formerly HSTS03-05-R-CPE150), is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a full and open solicitation.  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has a requirement for ongoing ordering of containers for the recycling of inkjet and laser printer cartridges and the actual recycling of the cartridges as needed.  TSA plans to establish a single, no cost contract to fulfill this requirement; however, the Government reserves the right to not award any contract and does not guarantee any order placements.  The resultant contract award will be five (5) years in duration with an unlimited ceiling.  The Government anticipates placing orders via no-cost delivery order.  The services rendered are to be free of cost to the Government with the selected contractor entitled to keep the proceeds from recycling of the cartridges.

Despite the services being free to the Government, the Government will still conduct a best value analysis to determine the awardee.  Within this synopsis/solicitation are the Evaluation Criteria and Statement of Work for the recycling program, by which each company will be evaluated.  The offeror must be capable of providing the supplies listed and delivered to the various locations.  

Offerors are requested to demonstrate their expertise through a written quotation.  The written response to this RFP may be done in one (1) volume.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD Pax River) intends to award a sole source contract to Gas Turbine Services, a small business located in Salem, NH 03079, for follow on work related to the development of automated test cell procedures, and the performance of engine and test cell data trending, primarily focused on the J52 and T700 platforms. Gas Turbine Services is in the final phase of a three phase effort, and posesses unique capabilities and expertise in this area, having previously developed the test cell data trending formats and procedures for the J52.

No subcontracting opportunities exist. No separate solicitation is available, nor will any be issued. This is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Such determination shall be entirely at the discretion of the Government. The following FAR clauses apply (as appropriate) to this acquisition: 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial, 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items, 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items.

 *  an existing published wage determination
 *  a survey underlying a wage determination
 *  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
    a wage determination matter
 *  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

 On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
 for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
 Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
 because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
 Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
 contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
 and 3.) should be followed.

 With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
 process described here, initial contact should be with the
 Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

        Branch of Construction Wage Determinations

        Wage and Hour Division

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
 interested party (those affected by the action) can request
 review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
 (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

        Wage and Hour Administrator

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
 interested party's position and by any information (wage
 payment data, project description, area practice material,
 etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
 interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
 Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

        Administrative Review Board

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

PRINCIPLE STATEMENT OF WORK

(1) The contractor shall provide an overall conceptual engineering design of a research wind tunnel to meet the specifications given.  The contractor shall provide a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to the AF. Following the PDR, and with AF approval, the contractor shall proceed and complete the design that includes all construction details and notes on drawings.  Upon successful completion of the PDR, the contractor shall submit final engineering drawings to the AF for approval and authorization to proceed (ATP).  The design must comply with all applicable State Codes, City Ordinances, Factory Mutual Insurance Company requirements, and all agencies having jurisdiction over this job.  Any required permits are the responsibility of the contractor.

(2) The contractor shall design and manufacture a research wind tunnel to AF specifications.  The contractor shall provide bi-weekly status reports to the AF focal point and allow AF representatives to visit the contractor at any time to review the design and/or inspect the wind tunnel during its manufacture.  Upon completion of the wind tunnel fabrication, the contractor shall provide as-built drawings.  Bidders shall specify whether an operational checkout at the manufacturing site will be performed.  The contractor shall also provide a written summary of the operational checkout of the wind tunnel (if performed).  The AF or a designated representative will perform a buyoff inspection at the contractor’s location prior to shipping.  On AF approval, the contractor shall package and ship the wind tunnel to the installation site in Pomona, California.

(3) The contractor shall install a Northrop Grumman (NG)-type designed model support system onto the new wind tunnel.  The model support system, seen in the Concept Support Picture at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/, will be constructed under a separate contract and provided to the wind tunnel contractor for installation. The contractor shall mount the model support hardware below the test section.  This system includes a strut that extends up into the test section for mounting test models.  It provides pitch and yaw control of the model.  An Interface Control Drawing (ICD) is shown in the Concept Support Picture at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/.  It shows the model support hardware installation in the wind tunnel test section.  A NG-designed slotted turntable (45 inch diameter, 1/4 inch thick aluminum disk) will be installed into a circular cutout in the floor of the test section, flush with the tunnel’s floor surface.  The disk turns with the support system for yaw control.  The strut extends through the slotted disk and pivots to give pitch control.  The support system must be positioned and leveled (with respect to the tunnel centerline when installed) so that the center of rotation of the support system coincides with the center of the test section.

(4) The contractor shall install a base to locate the support system vertically.  The base will be attached to the floor below the test section and the support system will be mounted on top of three adjustable leveling feet.  Dimensions of the base are approximately 38 inches wide by 55 inches long by 12 inches high. (The height of the base is dependent upon the distance from the floor to the test section centerline.)  An existing base design is available from NG and will be modified and constructed by another vendor and supplied to the wind tunnel vendor for installation under the test section.

(5) The contractor shall perform functional tests of the new wind tunnel to verify that all specifications are met and make all adjustments or corrections, as required to achieve operation and test section airflow quality within the specification.  Any negative deviation from the specifications must be approved by the AF. To verify the flow quality, the contractor shall perform a detailed calibration of the airflow in the test section of the installed wind tunnel.  This would include two-dimensional mappings (every 2” in the y and z directions normal to the flow direction) of flow velocity, flow angularity in pitch and yaw, and turbulence intensity at 3 (streamwise) stations along the test section: the center of the test section and two other longitudinal stations +/-20” from the first.

(6) The contractor shall provide calibration data to correlate control panel speed setting to test section air velocity for clear test section.

(7) The contractor shall provide a training session for the AF and CPP personnel.  Topics include facility operation, maintenance, servicing, precautions, etc.

(8) The contractor shall provide two complete sets of documentation describing the operation and maintenance of the wind tunnel and all support equipment.

(9) The contractor shall provide printed engineering drawings, 2-D and 3-D in AutoCAD, of the as-built wind tunnel facility on E-size drawings (28” x 40”) and electronic drawing files on CD-ROM.  Electronic drawing files shall be provided in both .pdf format as well as AutoCAD or IGES format.

OPTIONAL STATEMENT OF WORK

Contractors shall perform the following tasks that consist of enhancements to the principal statement of work.  

(1) The contractor shall utilize a chilled water line that passes by the wind tunnel site. Providing a heat exchanger and a (water) tank in lieu of a water cooling tower.  The contractor shall size the system to maintain wind tunnel temperature at ambient +/- 5 degrees F.  Local ambient temperatures range from 50 to 105 degrees F.  It is anticipated that, without cooling, flow temperature will rise by 25 degrees F above ambient during a typical run.  The contractor shall install the tower at an AF approved location near the wind tunnel, make all required hookups (electrical, water, etc.), check out operation and obtain all of the required permits.  

(2) Improve flow quality in the test section from those specified in above (Principle Statement of Work) to - Flow uniformity:  0.25% variation from average velocity or less; Turbulence:  0.07% turbulence intensity or less; Flow angularity:  *0.1 degree variation or less in pitch and yaw (clear test section).

These are maximum values allowed at the array of points specified in the flow calibration of the test section described in the principle statement of work.

To achieve this improved flow quality, it is recommended that Items a - c below be considered.

(a) The contractor shall add two additional screens, after the honeycomb and before the contraction cone to improve flow uniformity in the test section.

(b) The contractor shall add a constant section, of length equal to one effective diameter of the tunnel at that location, between turn 4 and the contraction cone to improve flow quality in the test section, if you add this constant section, the wind tunnel length should not exceed 62'.

(c) The contractor shall add corner fillets to all four corners of the test section, with proper fairings upstream and downstream of the test section, to improve flow quality in the test section. Fillets are to be such as to account for growth of the boundary layers on the walls of the test section. Therefore, the test section walls shall be parallel, in pairs.

(3) The contractor shall install lights in the test section fillets, 4 places, to improve lighting in the test section.

(4) The contractor shall provide and install noise reduction equipment (acoustic silencers) inside the wind tunnel to reduce the level of wind tunnel noise. The contractor shall specify the noise level reduction provided by the silencers (dBA) at 100, 200 and 300 ft/sec.

(5) The contractor shall provide automatic controls of wind tunnel parameters including dynamic pressure (q), temperature, model pitch, and model yaw.  Analog voltages will be available from the model support system for pitch and yaw.  The AF will provide the needed programming in LabVIEW.

(6) The contractor shall provide a comparison of costs for alternative wind tunnel construction materials (fiberglass, wood, other) and include a durability warranty extension statement.  The contractor shall make recommendations based on expected operating conditions: moderate climate, dry, windy, direct sunlight (20 – 105 degrees Fahrenheit), earthquake-proof, etc.

(7) The contractor shall provide a motorized 3-D traversing mechanism that will be mounted inside and at the downstream end of the test section and allow for flow measurements throughout most of the test section (for example the detailed calibration of the test section flow, as described on top of page 5).

(8) The contractor shall design the test section to be easily removable, interchangeable and portable and supply one additional removable test sections for 2-D airfoil testing.

(9) The contractor shall provide computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the flow in the test section and tunnel circuit.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

		During Country Manager Afas’s recent business development trip to Morocco in April 2005, she met with officials from the Moroccan Office National de l’Electricite (ONE) and the Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) to discuss potential USTDA support for a number of projects within the electric power sector.  ONE and OCP have both requested USTDA funding assistance for projects related to their future development plans, including liberalizing the electricity sector, seawater use optimization, recovering hydrokinetic energy at port complexes, upgrading communication line technologies, and improved energy efficiency infrastructure. 

The electric power sector in Morocco presents excellent opportunities for USTDA to focus on a number of projects that represent developmental priorities for Morocco and have the potential to increase U.S. exports.  The DM would focus on expanding USTDA’s role in Morocco’s energy sector, which is one of the MENASA Region’s sector priorities for FY 05, and introducing relevant Moroccan entities to U.S. technologies that could be utilized in modernizing this sector.  

Office National de l’Electricite

ONE is a publicly owned company and it is the principal actor in Morocco’s electricity sector.  ONE was solely responsible for electricity generation, transport and distribution until 1995, when it was reorganized with the anticipation of eventually liberalizing the sector.  While ONE still dominates, the Government of Morocco (GOM) would like to gradually transform it into the industry regulator as well as a minor producer.  At the moment, ONE is the sole distributor of electricity throughout Morocco, with the exception of approximately fifteen cities, which are served by municipal controls or private dealers.  ONE currently fulfills the mission of single purchaser in Morocco and power plants sell all of their production to the company, which in turn sells it to residential and industrial clients.  

ONE requested USTDA support for technical assistance (TA) to help the company reform the electricity sector in Morocco.  In particular, this reform is intended to produce:
·	Progressive liberalization of production and marketing activities related to the electric power sector;
·	Nondiscriminatory access (or third party access) to the distribution and grid systems;
·	The enforcement of quality control and efficiency standards for network managers; and 
·	The creation of a sector regulator to oversee and manage the responsibilities distributed amongst several government departments.

The proposed TA would assist ONE with its internal reorganization and its strategic positioning with the ultimate goal of liberalizing the electricity sector.  

With the opening of the Moroccan economy, ONE’s private sector customers must become more competitive in order to succeed in international markets.  Electricity constitutes an important input for these firms and would support efforts to increase competitiveness.  ONE’s objective is to develop and to enrich energy efficiency services to its customers.  ONE has requested USTDA funding for a feasibility study on the creation of an energy efficiency service company based on the model of American energy services companies.  

ONE continues to seek ways to expand its services to meet the needs of its more than twenty million customers, of which 43% are rural.  The distribution network, which is used to deliver electricity to households, presents the most appropriate method for distributing telecommunications services.  Through Transmission Currents in Line technology (CPL) residential customers would be able to access telecommunications services provided by ONE.  CPL is a mode of practical connection for households and Small and Medium Enterprises.  ONE has requested assistance to analyze and measure the capacities of ONE’s network, to determine the structure of CPL development and to study the technical and economic viability of launching CPL. 

Office Cherifien des Phosphates

OCP, a state-owned agency formed in 1920, is solely responsible for managing and controlling all aspects of phosphate mining and beneficiation in Morocco.  With more than 50% of the world’s known phosphate deposits, phosphate mining and fertilizer production is Morocco’s major industry.   The export of phosphates and its derivatives account for more than a quarter of the country’s exports and one-third of the country’s manufacturing sector.  The fertilizer production sector is among the largest foreign exchange earners for Morocco and employs more than 30,000 citizens for both skilled and semi-skilled jobs.  As such, OCP is the world leader in the phosphate’s market and is Morocco’s largest company (employing approximately 20,000 Moroccans).  It is also the world’s number one phosphates exporter, with market share of twenty-eight percent.  OCP moved into downstream processing in 1965, converting lower-grade rock to phosphoric acid and fertilizers at its plants along the coast.  OCP has requested USTDA assistance with its operations at these plants.     
  
The Chemical Complex at the Jorf Lasfar Port in Morocco consists of a main pumping station and a reservation station.  Water is pumped from the Atlantic Ocean to cool the chemical complex during phosphate production.  As the water is heated up during this process, it is rejected back to the Atlantic Ocean via a restitution canal.  The water passes through this canal at 48,000 to 60,000 cm per hour.  Energy is created through the heat and velocity released during this process, however it is not captured and is instead lost at sea.  OCP has requested USTDA assistance for a feasibility study to design a system to recover the hydrokinetic energy that is currently lost in order to produce electricity from the seawater restitution canal.  

OCP has also requested assistance related to the Chemical Complex at Safi Port, which consists of three pumping stations and a reservation station.  Similar to the operations at Jorf Lasfar, seawater is pumped from the Atlantic Ocean to cool the temperature of the sulphuric and phosphoric acid that is released during the phosphate production process.  Although this process is effective, it consumes a lot of energy and is very expensive to maintain.  OCP has requested assistance to analyze the existent seawater pumping and distribution network, in order to optimize flows, recover heat from phosphoric acid in the cooling system and reduce global pumping and distribution costs and consequently energy consumption.
 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

<DESC>This is an Amendment to combined synopsis/solicitation W31P4Q-05-T-R017.  The purpose of this Amendment is to answer questions received. Q. 1.  Is an on-site visit allowed during this additional amendment period? A.1.  There will be no on-site visit during this period. Q. 2.  The original specification indicated that you required a 'dry gap' dynamometer.  By the nature of the question asked, the party asked if you have the ability to 'free dump' water after passing through the absorber.  Your answer indicated that one co uld assume to have the ability to 'free dump' the water and that a closed loop system is not required.  I raise the following issues. a.  If the original specification is a 'dry gap' dynamometer, then with your answer, one might assume that you could substitute a 'wet gap' dynamometer.  If one does substitute a 'wet gap' dynamometer, it is very possible that the equipment would not be ab le to meet the specifications of the intended purpose.  With a 'wet gap' dynamometer, cooling water can 'free dump' into a tank beneath the dynamometer, but then needs to be pumped back to the cooling tower.  So a sump would be required which is additional  facilities to be added to your test cell.  Secondly, a 'wet gap' dynamometer has a water drag that in the case of a 150HP dynamometer is approximately 50 to 100 lb-ft of drag at 8000RPM that would make it difficult to test your lower HP engines.   b.  By indicating 'free dump', it opens up an ambiguous definition as to what is required to meet the original specification.  I would suggest that you either indicate a 'dry gap' or a 'wet gap' dynamometer as the specification.  It seems that would be mus t clearer and remove all confusion as to what 'free dump' actually means. A.2.  Even though the dyno is called 'dry gap', it still has to be liquid or water cooled. Hence the need for either an open 'free dump' system or a closed 'regenerative' system. By 'free dump' we mean that the water is drained into a sewage drain after it  goes through the dyno.  The term 'free dump' implies that it doesn't get recirculated. A wet gap dyno does not meet the requirements because it is not acceptable for the lower HP engines. The closing date is not extended and remains 22 June 2005, noon, local time. For information regarding this solicitation contact Beverly Gonzales, 256-876-5326.
