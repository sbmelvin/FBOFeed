<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR the Bio-Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (BSPK) Production Project. This is a pre-solicitation synopsis which is not a request for competitive proposals. The purpose of this project is to expand the U.S. domestic industrial base capability in the production of bio-mass derived fuel (bio-fuel) products. The DPA Title III Program Office intends to award a contract or a Technology Investment Agreement, as appropriate, on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to UOP, LLC., 50 E. Algonquin Rd., Des Plaines, IL 60017. Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to modify an existing bio-fuel conversion facility in order to establish, expand and optimize a dedicated, feedstock flexible bio-fuel manufacturing process. The conversion facility to be modified must be able to demonstrate a minimum current capacity of 2,000 gallons of BSPK production per day with an infrastructure capable of expanding BSPK production levels to a minimum of 5,000 gallons per day after the modification is complete. A dedicated production process is one specifically designed for the production of bio-mass derived fuel products as opposed to a process where bio-fuel products are manufactured as a bi-product of diesel fuel production. Feedstock flexible is a process capability which allows for easy interchange of different raw material sources and allows for drop-in substitutions without risk of loss production time, increased cost, or significant equipment and/or process changes. The period of performance for this project is anticipated to be 18 months. In order to meet the Government's cost and schedule requirements, this project requires an integrated design authority who possesses significant bio-fuel intellectual property as well as demonstrated experience in design, development, process implementation, inspection, testing and validation of the bio-fuel manufacturing processes and product lines. Additionally, the selected contractor must have: demonstrated leadership in the bio-fuel industry; existing merchant-oriented bio-fuel production; demonstrated acceptance and credibility among bio-fuel producers and demonstrated business viability. Key tasks will include: development and implementation of production capacity expansion plans addressing cost reductions, quality, production volumes and other process metrics; continued support to the DoD customer product specifications and qualifications; and development and implementation of a comprehensive strategic business plan and a marketing plan that addresses both Government and commercial bio-fuel need and applications.<br />The Government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), "Only One Responsible Source" or "DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400 (b)," based on the aforementioned requirements, as well as an assessment of technical and programmatic risk to the Government. Offerors who are capable of meeting the requirements stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. This documentation shall specify the offeror's area of expertise and experience. It shall identify the offeror's current production capabilities and capacities for production of bio-fuel. Documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered along with market share. The documentation shall identify relevant production experience, and a listing of both DoD and commercial customers that currently utilize the offeror's bio-fuel products. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered. Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement. Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency. See Numbered Note 22.*****<br />

<a href="mailto:harry.bryan@gunter.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>Request for Information Number: 10-0001Notice Type: Presolicitation Synopsis: 
The Air Force often selects its implementation efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. The Headquarters Air Force A6 and Chief Information Officer, at the Pentagon is requesting information from industry to obtain market research data to assist future business approaches for building, and sustaining a mobile telephone environment. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the US Air Force will contract for the items contained in the Request For Information (RFI). The Chief Technology Office (CTO) intends to use this information to support future acquisitions.  This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future AF program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announce! ment to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the project and project implementation challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future AF Program BAA and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution.  All pricing or broad gauge costing information will be restricted from public distribution if requested.  By restricting pricing information while keeping technical data unrestricted, the government intends to improve on the project requirement as well as understand the broad gauge costing for such a project if implemented.  The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.
Background 
Current requirements cover basic analog telephone services to all Air Force Airmen and current cellular services.  New options to improve the mobility, service, and functionality of users while reducing conventional costs bring a new opportunity to utilize mobile technology.  With the increase in the reliability of mobile phone services and the high costs of maintaining analog telephone services, the government is attempting to discern the service levels, security, and cost structures for achieving a better balance between its investments in fixed legacy communications infrastructure with emerging mobile personal devices that provide improved capabilities beyond just voice services.  The SAF/XC CTO is seeking innovative ideas, concepts, and pricing models for the implementation of a cutting edge solution which improves the full range of user mobile experience, reduces legacy telephone infrastructure, while pushing the range of acquisition and technology. 


PurposeMore specifically, SAF/XC is interested in forward leaning mobile solutions which would provide a "mobile phone for every Airman" which:A.  Provides ubiquitous telephony access by providing a mobile device for every Air Force Airman (approximately 300K) B.  Provides a reliable mobile infrastructure providing 99.99% reliability for all phone calls to include resiliency in making emergency phone calls at every SAF/XC location in the United StatesC.  Provides the potential to replace desktop phones with mobile devicesD.  Offers (or supports) a range of mobile devices, including highly capable mobile devices supporting, voice, text, browsing and multimedia content playing/recording (audio, picture/video)E.  Service includes unlimited voice and messaging capabilities with option to include shared or unlimited data connectivity. (Options detailing tiers of service will also be accepted)   Options should be included to address international roaming (both voice and data) to be part of unlimited plans or tiered plans. F.  Provide option for virtual personal and business calling/data plans which would allow for separate billing for official/unofficial calls/data plans, unless proposing unlimited plans.G.  Options to manage obsolescence/updates for mobile devices: i.  Provide options for government and/or personal insurance of devicesii.  Supports routine replacement of outdated devices and simple procedures for replacing users associated with a device. H.  Mobile device architecture will be in compliance with DoD security requirements to include appropriate encryption capabilities for unclassified sensitive emails or secure web sites.

Provide the ability to encrypt local dataiv.  Provide DoD compliant password authentication and device lockv.  Provide the ability to disable hardware features (e.g. Bluetooth/cameras)vi.  Provides the ability to create white/black lists of applicationsvii. Meets government mandates for data-at-rest requirements as well as the ability to completely wipe devices if tampered with or security policies exceeded.I.   Mobile devices will have the capability to integrate with unified communications and knowledge operations strategies Integration with Active Directory is essential.  Presence with fixed and mobile devices and applications is highly desired as is the ability to utilize SharePoint, Office Communication Server, and Defense Connect Online on a mobile deviceJ.  Reduces the overall legacy telephone infrastructure without adding significant mobile telephone infrastructure costs outside of a monthly subscription service per phone i.  Optimize and/or remove Blackberry deployments to decrease back-office support, hardware, etc. in the AFNet/base data centersii.  Provides the ability to utilize existing wireless data services available via the AFNet/base infrastructure (provide any relevant tariff data with this option) iii.  Minimizes the amount of AF or DoD-specific maintenance support (e.g. OTA software/hardware patches, maintenance support) K.  Potentially provides integration with the current Defense Switched Network (DSN) infrastructure to place calls utilizing DSN services (low priority requirement)L.  Provides state-of-the-art, yet secure, capabilities to:i.  Provides a wide range of mobile applications to extend mission effectiveness e.g. GPS, GPS labeled/stamped photos & videos, GPS-enabled social networking, audio to text conversionii.  Opportunities to support "push-to-talk" capabilities to support flight-line or other disconnected user scenariosiii.  Support GPS-enabled operations to allow for the passing of device location to support emergency response, flight-line, medical, or other AF operationsM.  Maximize the utilization of already owned AF applications/capabilities while also maximizing utilization of open platforms (which meet DoD security criteria)N.  Provides a simple process for integrating with the corporate phone book (or AF Global Address List)O.  Provide the ability to securely synchronize all device content - such as image, documents, contacts, emails, etc - into the base, automatically, without having to connect the device to a PC and explicitly trigger such synchronization
The purpose of this RFI is to gather input for an SAF/XCAF Workshop on "Mobile Phone for Every Airmen" anticipated to take place on 15 May 2010 in the Hampton Roads Area. The government reserves the right to provide an information briefing and take Q&A no later than 30 days prior to the workshop.  The workshop objective is to understand the potential feasibility and limitations of a full SAF/XC mobile infrastructure that can be scaled to the AF enterprise.  Participants will be selected only from respondents to this RFI. Workshop participation will be limited to US citizens and permanent US residents who fall within AF contracting guidelines. This workshop seeks to accomplish the following:     1) Identify potential solutions to converting existing analog telephone systems to a 80+% mobile environment; and     2) Explore procurement strategies and pricing structures to implement these concepts.The practical aspects of operations and deployment are substantial considerations at this stage, SAF/XC also seeks to understand the potential infrastructure costs/savings, sustainability issues, reliability concerns being presented. 
Workshop Format
It is anticipated that this one-day workshop will bring together phone vendors, service providers, and software vendors from diverse mobile solutions, including Apple, Microsoft, Google, AT&T, Verizon, VMWare, Nextel, and Sprint.

<DESC>The National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is soliciting qualifications from firms to provide Engineering-Construction and System Integration services for the 5 MW Dynamometer Spin Test Facility.  NREL will select qualified firms from the RFQ to receive the Request for Proposal (RFP).  RFQ requirements are noted later in this document.  The release of the RFP is anticipated in August/September 2010.

SCOPE OF WORK

The intent of the RFP is to award a contract for Engineering-Construction and System Integration services for the 5 MW Dynamometer Spin Test Facility.

The RFP for the project will be based off of bridging documents.  The bridging documents will include approximately 50% design drawings, outline specifications and a preliminary systems integration plan.  The documents will also include the conceptual designs for the specialized electrical and specialized mechanical equipment.  The specialized electrical and mechanical equipment will include motor drives (variable frequency drives), dynamometer motor, gearbox, and non-torque loading system.

The scope of work to be included in the RFP will include:
	Complete the facility design, engineering and construction for civil, architectural, structural, mechanical/plumbing, electrical, fire detection and suppression, cctv, security, tele/data, test-in-progress notification and interlocks, overhead-crane, and other required specialty disciplines.  This scope includes general building requirements as well as foundations and structural support for Government Furnished Equipment.
	Installation of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  GFE includes motor drives (variable frequency drives), dynamometer motor, gearbox, and non-torque loading system.  A full list of GFE will be included with the RFP.
	Systems Integration of the specialty electrical and specialty mechanical equipment.  This will include design and installation of all interfaces between the GFE noted above and between the GFE and the general building services.

FACILITY DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this project is to construct a facility to increase NRELs testing capabilities for wind turbines.  The facility will house custom built and complex research equipment to test and certify wind turbines for our industry partners. The building may pursue a LEED Certification (actual level TBD).   The building will be located at the National Wind Technology Center, 18200 Highway 128, Golden, Colorado in Jefferson County.  The facility is currently estimated to be $10,000,000 including Government Furnished Equipment.  
The existing dynamometer building at the National Wind Technology Center (Building 255) consists of a 50 x 80 high bay pre-engineered metal building (PEMB) with a 20 x 80 control and support building connected to the high-bay.
The concepts for the new facility that are being considered are to add on to the existing high bay PEMB or locate a new, stand alone PEMB near the existing dynamometer building.  An additional control and support building will be added to the new facility.  The new PEMB is anticipated to need a 125 ton overhead bridge crane in. 
It is anticipated that the project General Building design and construction can start in advance of the Research Equipment Support.  See work delineation below.
General Building
The general build work includes site work, foundations, structural systems, building envelope, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire-suppression, life safety, communication/data, security system, bridge crane, and interior finishes required for the PEMB and control room. 
Research Equipment Support
The research equipment support includes foundations and structural systems, high-bay floor, specialized mechanical, specialized electrical, test article support, access for routing of controls and hydraulics, and systems integration.  The specialized electrical and mechanical equipment will include motor drives (variable frequency drives), dynamometer motor, gearbox, and non-torque loading system.
The floor in the existing dynamometer high bay consists of 5 thick slabs-on-grade with electric and hydraulic line trenches, concrete equipment pedestals and recessed bay cast metal plate.  The loads placed on the floor/pedestals will be in the 100-200 ton range.   Similar construction is expected in the new facility.

<DESC>In response to additional restoration funding, a follow-on habitat design plan is required for Upper Newsome Creek located on the Red River Ranger District of the Nez Perce National Forest.  The initial design was awarded to Ecosystem Research Group, based in Missoula, MT, using competitive procedures in 2007 and completed in 2008.  Competition for the follow-on design is being limited to Ecosystem Research Group and the subcontractors and affiliates that worked on the original design.  It was determined that opening up the competition to the broader marketplace would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the Forest Service that was not expected to be recovered through competition.  The contract awardee will utilize existing watershed data to design additional work elements for the restoration project.  The awardee shall then supplement and update the original design documents, specifications, maps, worklists and materials lists with the new information.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.

Finally, the contractor shall demonstrate the probe on commercially available MOSFETs with sub-micrometer channel lengths. The specific tasks pursuant to this effort are described in the Performance Work Statement included in the Request for Quote (SB1341-10-RQ-0178). It is anticipated that the solicitation for this procurement will be issued on or about March 23, 2010 under FAR Part 12 procedures.

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Office of Acquisitions, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with the Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York, 630 west 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, for professional service to support the NINDS' study on neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 541690 and the business size standard is $7.0 million. This is a firm fixed-price type acquisition.<br /><br />The NINDS, Molecular Neuropharmacology Section has an on-going research on development, testing, and optimization of constructs and cell lines that stably express the appropriate quantities and ratios of D2 receptor and &szlig;-arrestin-fusion proteins for robust bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) analysis for the R21 grant award "Functional-selective ligands for the D2 dopamine receptor." These include stable HEK293 cell lines expressing human &szlig;-arrestin and mutants thereof fused to mVenus fluorescent protein with tetracycline-inducible expression of human dopamine D2 receptors fused to Rennila luciferase. These cell lines will be used by the Sibley laboratory and the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) to conduct high throughout screens of small molecule libraries to identify novel allosteric modulators of D2 receptors.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is associated with neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based anti-Parkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less-conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The Trustees of Columbia University will develop cell lines that will be used in a BRET-based primary high throughput screening assay for a Molecular Libraries Probe Production Center Network approved project for &szlig;-arrestin recruitment in response to dopamine D2 receptor activation.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is based on a R21 Award 1R21NS067642-01 to the Sibley Laboratory (Intramural) and the Javitch Laboratory (Extramural). These studies are to be carried out within the NINDS Intramural Research Program and the NCGC in collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Jonathan A. Javitch at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeon. The Javitch laboratory was selected for collaboration and to provide the required constructs because of their internationally established expertise in structure-function studies of dopamine receptors and their pioneering application of BRET-based methods to receptor oligomerization and activation of G proteins and &szlig;-arrestin, as well as an established collaboration with the Sibley laboratory, who has already tested the preliminary reagents developed in the Javitch laboratory and found that they will be suitable for the creation of the stably transfected cell line proposed for these studies. Based on the experience and the involvement of the Javitch laboratory with the on-going study, it is determined that the Javitch laboratory/ the Trustees of Columbia University is the unique and qualified vendor to perform the requirement. No other sources will satisfy the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>The period of performance is to be six (6) months from date of award with option for one (1) twelve-month optional period. Place of performance is Bethesda, Maryland.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider response submit to ln18x@nih.gov on or before 3:00 PM ET April 6, 2010. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the government to determine if the party can perform the requirement.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) www.orca.bpn.gov. Please reference announcement number NOI-1531865 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to Carl Zeiss SMT for the replacement and modernization of TRS 2kx2k slow-scan CCD camera on Zeiss 912 Omega Transmission Electron Microscope.  NINDS engages in fundamental research on the structural and physiological basis of excitotoxic injury of large central nervous system neurons.  Many of the principle techniques of modern structural biology, especially advanced electron microscopy and low-temperature preservation techniques are critical tools for NINDS.  A critical instrument for this research is a Zeiss 912 energy-filtering transmission electron microscope (EFTEM), whose capabilities for low-dose; quantitative imaging, energy filtering, and cryoelectron microscopy are absolutely dependent on a pre-existing TRS low-noise, scientific-grade CCD camera interfaced to the microscope.

Carl Zeiss SMT, the manufacturer of existing 912 Omega electron microscopes, is the only camera system that is fully compatible with the mechanical, hardware, and software environment of the 912.  Separately from the internal software, this contract also provides for an upgrade to the current version of the SIS Windows-based iTEM suite of instrument-specific control and processing software; this software is critical to the coordination of camera and microscope and is the only available from Zeiss SMT.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 1530768 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2080 and Attention: Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist.

On or about February 19, 2010, a solicitation for a renovation project will be posted on FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov). The Government's objective is to obtain services, including all labor, material, transportation, equipment, and supervision required to accomplish renovation(s) of Bachelor Enlisted Quarters 633 and 634 (approximately 52,000 sq ft each), Naval Station Great Lakes, IL as described and as shown in specifications and drawings that will be provided in the solicitation. All work is to be performed in an unoccupied facility, where the contractor will be required to coordinate with the Contracting Officer to complete the work.  
This project will repair existing BEQ Buildings 633 and B-634, class A student quarters. The existing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, electrical and lighting systems including power distribution wiring, plumbing system, and the exterior brick walls are all in need of repair. By repairing these major systems, the life safety, building code, and quality of life deficiencies of the building will be corrected Electrical repairs include repair and/or replace transformer, power panels, circuit breakers, wiring and cabling for the building system load, fire alarm protection system, lighting system, egress lighting fixtures, and outlet receptacles. The standing metal roof system requires minor repairs to maintain its integrity. The plumbing system repairs include replacing deteriorated water supply and wastewater piping, bathroom fixtures, and toilet stalls. The steam pipes and other HVAC components will be repaired thus improving the quality of air flow improving the class A student berthing and studying environment.
The project will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract.  The Government reserves the right to enter into negotiations or limit the competitive range.  The approximate value of the project is more than $10,000,000.  Performance and payment bonds are required. All interested 8(a) firms must have bonding capability.
The Government will request for proposals (RFP) from firms in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and Navy/Marine Corps Acquisition Guide for a competitive negotiated procurement utilizing the Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides best value to the Government.  In accordance with FAR 36.3, this procurement will consist of two phases.  Phase I is the qualification phase.  The evaluation factors for Phase I are as follows:   Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience; Technical Qualifications; and Management Approach.  Up to five (5) firms will be pre-qualified to participate in Phase II.  The Navy will determine which offerors will precede to Phase II. Phase II will include the following factors:  Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience; Technical Qualifications; and Management Approach (same as Phase I unless conditions change); Design Solution and Narrative; Durability, Sustainability, Maintainability of Building Systems; and Project Scheduling and Phasing, and Price.
As the solicitation will be issued via the internet, all prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  All contractors are encouraged to attempt to download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.  Many firms and commercial printing services have the capability to print the solicitation package and plan holders list off the internet, if necessary.  The official plan holders list will be created by registration and will be available from the website only.  Amendments will also be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method for distributing amendments; therefore, it is the offerors' responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.
Offers will be publicly opened.  The number of offers received, the identity of the offers received, the amount of any offer or relative standing of the offers will not be disclosed to anyone until the time of contract award.

The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government.  The CCR website can be accessed at www.ccr.gov.  Reference is made to DFARS Clause 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration.  All new contracts can ONLY be made to contractors who are registered in CCR.  This requirement will apply to all solicitations and awards, regardless of the media used.

Estimated Period of Performance:  April 18, 2010 to April 18, 2011
Location of Work to be Performed:  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW					   3rd and 6th Floors, Ariel Rios North and                                                               1st and 4th Floors, EPA West					   Washington, DC  20460
I.   Introduction  
	EPA's Office of Policy, Economics, and Innovation supports the Agency's mission by promoting innovation that achieves greater and more cost effective public health and environmental protection and by managing and participating in the regulation development process.  The Office, in consultation with its different internal and external stakeholders and partners, supports and oversees the testing of new and innovative approaches to environmental protection and related policy changes.  OPEI is the focal point for regulatory analyses, policy development, and economic analyses necessary to support EPA's regulatory development process and changes in today's business conditions.   OPEI's role in the regulatory development process is to manage the process and ensure that the underlying policy analyses are sound.  OPEI helps strengthen the analytic foundation of the Agency's decision making processes, working with EPA's Science Advisor to strengthen the integration of scientific and economic analyses.
	The Office is organized into three independent offices, including two national centers.  Areas of expertise and the types of records that are created and maintained vary significantly between the offices.  Consequently, in order to create and implement sound records management practices that comply with Agency and National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) policies, technical experts from each of the offices have been identified and are integral to the successful delivery of the work in this contract.
II. Purpose and Scope:
	The purpose of this contract is to provide OPEI's Associate Administrator's Immediate Office, the four immediate offices associated with OPEI's sub-Offices, and the twelve divisions collectively in the National Center for Environmental Innovation (NCEI), the National Center for Environmental Economics (NCEE), and the Office of Regulatory Policy and Management (ORPM) with support in the form of Records Management Support Services.  OPEI's Offices compile information in many forms which they use to interact with the Office of Management and Budget, other federal agencies, Congress, states, tribal and local governments, individuals, communities, organizations, corporations, and other government agencies.  OPEI's Offices must be able to readily access all of its records to answer Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Congressional requests and prepare for various kinds of outreach activities to promote environmental health protection.  This means that an effective records management system must be in place.   Such a system must provide consistency in the way records are managed, greater efficiency in the filing and retrieval of documents, increased document security, and improved utilization of available space.

III. Performance Objective 1:  Intellectual Control of Records

	The contractor shall be responsible for meeting with each of OPEI's Offices and their designated Technical Expert.  The contractor shall also be responsible for meeting with any other designated EPA employee in these offices.  The purpose of these meetings is for the contractor to determine the nature of the files in each of the offices, and the need and type of filing system to develop for each office and their employees.  The contractor then shall provide this information to the COR and the COR will provide technical direction to the contractor on how to proceed.  The contractor will be responsible for meeting with the designated Technical Experts to conduct records inventories and identify what documents the staff has.  The contractor shall collect, organize, index, and inventory records in accordance with established structures.  Records shall be clearly labeled and handled in accordance with EPA guidance documents.   All phases of records disposition shall be performed, including identification by EPA Records Disposition Schedule, retirement to inactive storage, and destruction as authorized by EPA/OPEI personnel in accordance with the guidance documents.  Records identified by OPEI as support contract documents shall be clearly labeled and handled in accordance with EPA guidance documents.
	Acceptable performance for this task means:  (a) that files are organized and filed in accordance with EPA and NARA guidance documents, and that confidential and sensitive files are clearly labeled as to be easily distinguishable from "routine" files, (b) that a list of records recommended for purging, destruction, or retirement are identified and submitted to the PO, (c) that destruction and retirement activities are recorded in the final technical report; (d) that no shipments of transferred or retired records are refused due to improper indexing, boxing, labeling, and shipping procedures, and (e) that documents approved for destruction are destroyed in a timely manner.
	Contractor personnel may have access to confidential and sensitive information.  Contractor staffs are prohibited from releasing any information about EPA files, data processing activities or functions, or any other knowledge of EPA operations or data.  All contractor employees must adhere to Confidential Business Information (CBI) regulations, policies, and procedures.
IV. Performance Objective 2:  Specialized Services
	The contractor shall provide a draft OPEI records management policy and procedure guide that complements and arguments the Agency's records management policy, as well as a filing systems and file plans for each of the three major offices (NCEI, NCEE, ORPM).  In order to do this, the contractor will interview OPEI staff and management to determine options for OPEI-specific policies and procedures and draft options for OPEI management.  The contractor will be required to conduct records management training sessions that provide information on NARA and Agency records management policies, procedures and requirements and provide clear delineation of employee records management responsibilities to familiarize OPEI staff with procedures and responsibilities.  This includes producing any training or administrative support materials used to conduct the training.   Support materials shall be approved by the OPEI project officer to any training being given.
	Acceptable performance for this task means:  (a) that any policy and procedure guide complements (NARA and EPA record management policies and practices and is clear, informative and ease to use; (b) that training sessions are informative and materials useful as reference, and (c) that any file system developed is user friendly and easy to maintain.
V.  Evaluation Criteria:	Technical Approach to SOW"	The project manager must have at least a minimum of three (3) years government   information/records management experience."

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Personnel Recovery Recapitalization Program (HH-60 Recap)
Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request For Information (CRFI)

INTRODUCTION The Air Force is planning to acquire a Personnel Recovery Recapitalization aircraft to replace the current HH-60G fleet. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI. This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition approach. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent perm! itted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government will determine that their contractor team members have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The Government will not reply to information received. The Government may conduct follow-on discussions with responders through individual one-on-one and/or collective "industry day" sessions.
It is anticipated the United States Air Force will replace an estimated 112 HH-60G air vehicles. The first lot is anticipated to be awarded beginning in FY12. To assist in this effort, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), 303rd AESW, 669th AESS/SYKA, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of providing eight (8) aircraft (excluding any RDT&E aircraft) with sufficient training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, technical data) to operate those aircraft.  The Air Force requires Initial Operational Capability (IOC) no later than 30 September 2015.
Meeting IOC at an affordable cost is critical. If the solution cannot meet all the capabilities, describe the capabilities your solution can meet if a contract award is made in FY12 and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities. If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired. Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities, rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other market information of potential solutions. &#8195;PURPOSE 
The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is (1) to engage industry early in the effort, (2) to identify sources that can provide capability if a contract award is made in FY12, and (3) to assist the Air Force in ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the HH-60 Recap capability. The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition approach. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP. RESPONSE GUIDANCE 
Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that 'publicly-releasable' and 'proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition. 
SSS/CRFI responses should include a: 
1. Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, and  large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB),  8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone) designation for NAICS code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company). 
2. Responses are limited to 30 pages and must be received by 12:00 Eastern Time 13 April 2010. Responses must be submitted via e-mail with a CD copy by regular mail in text searchable Portable Document Format (.pdf). 
3. Responses should be sent to the Contracting Officer, Jim Dinwoody, 669th AESS/SYKA, james.dinwoody@wpafb.af.mil, 1895 Fifth Street, Building 46, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7233.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/Sources Sought being released by the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Services (FAS) on behalf of the Intelligence Battle Laboratory (IBL), Ft. Huachuca to enhance the Mobile Immersive Video-Ground (MIV-G) capability by designing and creating a set of standard or common mounting equipment for the various MIV-G system configurations to allow for quick mount and dismount operations of the system for use on and in various vehicle platforms as well as on an individual person (MIV-G personnel configuration) for the following:
<p>The Mobile Immersive Video-Ground (MIV-G) is a mobile 360 degree and spherical full motion video collection system intended to be mounted on or in a vehicle to allow for 360 degree or spherical video collection of an area with just one pass. The capability allows for a reduction of risk to the warfighter by reducing their exposure to a certain area while continuing to affectively train, plan and execute operations. A significant issue exists with the lack of any common or standard internal and/or external vehicle quick mount and dismount system for the MIV-G cameras or camera array camera equipment which are part of the iMove Inc. camera systems that make up the MIV-G capability. Without these quick mount and dismount systems the operational use and effectiveness of the MIV-G capability is significantly reduced.</p>

If a small business, can your company assemble a team that performs at least 51% of the work (by dollar value)?<br />4. If NAICS code 541519 is not appropriate, which code is the most appropriate for a potential solicitation with the attached requirement?<br />5. Are the tasks clearly defined? Do you understand what the FDA requires? If not, what information needs to be added, changed and/or reworded?<br />6. What do you foresee as the risks of performance, cost and schedule with this effort? How might these risks be mitigated?<br />7. Keeping in mind that Time &amp; Materials and Labor Hour contract types are becoming more difficult to receive approval for, what contract type is the most appropriate for the attached statement of work?<br />8. Do the descriptions of the task contain sufficient detail to allow firm-fixed-price type proposals? Please provide the type of information that you would need in order to put together a firm-fixed-price type proposal.<br />9. What are potential cost drivers associated with the attached statement of work (including other direct costs and travel)?<br />10.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is being posted on GSA eBuy and via FedBizOpps, under the Franchise Authority of the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Financial Services Center (FSC).
The Department of Veterans Affairs Financial Services Center (VAFSC) is conducting market research on mailroom/scanning equipment.  VAFSC seeks to gain an understanding of mailroom/scanning equipment capabilities, functionality, and applicability to current operations.  Based on the results of this RFI, VAFSC will evaluate a future Request for Quote for procurement of mailroom/scanning equipment. 
This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of providing Mailing/Scanning equipment described herein.   The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement would be 333313, Incoming mail handling equipment (e.g., opening, scanning, sorting) manufacturing.  VAFSC is specifically interested in the BancTec X-series and the Opex AS3690i (or equivalent) scanning equipment.
The intent of this RFI is to gain awareness of the mailroom/scanning equipment being utilized by industry that can accommodate the high volume of documents the VAFSC mailroom receives on a daily basis. The capabilities and technical characteristics presented in this RFI shall be considered as guidance only. Firms are invited to indicate their interests and capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, information pertaining to experience on previous projects, and any other specific and pertinent information as it pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance the Governments consideration and evaluation of the information submitted. 
To better assist firms with identifying possible solutions, an overview of the VAFSC's mailroom operations and current equipment resources is illustrated below: 
The VAFSC is interested in a Mailroom/Scanning solution that both meets current operational needs and scales for anticipated future growth. The equipment currently used in the VAFSC mailroom is technologically outdated and needs to be replaced.  The VAFSC currently processes over one million pieces of mail on an annual basis and forecasts growth to three million pieces during Fiscal Year (FY) 2010.  Potential growth for years beyond FY 2010 could approximate ten million pieces of mail per year. However, this estimate includes mail volume for future business lines that may or may not be relocated to the VAFSC.  As a result, any solutions should include the flexibility to rapidly adjust to dynamic business conditions without negatively effecting production capabilities or customer service quality; and be capable of high speed scanning and contain document classification software using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to determine VAFSC defined document types.
The VAFSC is responsible for transacting a number of key financial functions for VA and Other Government Agencies. Therefore, the VAFSC is the recipient of a wide variety of mail that creates a challenge to ensure that all mail is processed accurately and efficiently. The VAFSC Mailroom and Scanning operation provides processes and applications to support opening, sorting, document preparation, batching and scanning of documents as they are received at the Mail Processing Unit (MPU) of the VAFSC. 
The primary types of mail received by the MPU include: 1.	Transmittal mail from other VA Stations2.	Mail received through USPS3.	Packaged mail via FedEx and other bulk shippers remain with their package.
These mail types include documents from vendors, employees, contractors, or third parties that will result in a transaction in the VA's Financial Management System (FMS) and a payment, credit or other adjustment in the financial records of the VA. Most of the documents received are invoices or medical claims from vendors that have provided services for VA facilities located throughout the country. The VAFSC is required to process mail driven transactions in a timely manner, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.
	The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made.  Respondents may be notified of the Government's acquisition method via an amendment to this notice or a new notice.  Based on the review of the responses to this RFI, the Government reserves the right to conduct competition either via GSA Federal Supply Schedules or full and open.
Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 5 pages that detail their firm's ability to provide solutions based the information specified above. All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by Government personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  Any and all information received will become the property of the Government and will not be returned.
Your response must be delivered via email to the address identified herein.  Response due date: no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 6 April 2010
Attn: Mr. Corey Gerst, Contract SpecialistEmail: corey.gerst@aqd.nbc.govPhone: (703) 964-3620		For any questions include with your full name, the RFI number & title (VA Mailroom/Scanning Equipment) your organization name, complete address, and phone and fax numbers. TELEPHONE INQUIRES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The deadline for submission of questions regarding this notice is 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 30 March 2010 to the Contract Specialist noted herein.

The NAICS for this procurement is 238210 Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors. The size standard is $14.0 million.
1. REQUIREMENT
The main circuit breaker at Floyd Bennett Field's building 88 (South Vault) need to be tested for their accuracy. The one particular test that needs to take place is called "relay operational trip test". Essentially the test will provide the current settings that the circuit breakers relays are presently set at. We have had problems where the circuit breakers have failed to trip when there was a cable fault on the field and the fault has bypassed the circuit breaker and caused a major power outage on the utility company lines. The test will need to be done in coordination with a representative from Con Edison who wishes to witness the trip test to verify its accuracy. The COTR will coordinate the scheduling between Con Edison and the Contractor.  The switchgear in question is manufactured by ABB Power T & D Company. They are ADVANCE MEDIUM VOLTAGE; METAL CLAD, SWITCHGEAR Catalog Number AA2112280000000P. There are six breakers in the vault. As part of the procedure the contractor will perform a visual inspection, perform as found tests, clean, vacuum, wipe down with solvents, de-grease, lubricate, and exercise breakers. Measure the contact resistance where possible to isolate to applicable N.E.T.A .MTS.
2. DELIVERY
The work to be accomplished is for all the switchgear working parts including the Circuit Breakers, Cabinets, Panels, Potential Transformers, Relays and Meters.  After the first test Con Edison will verify on site the appropriate settings so adjustments can be made in order to pass the test and be compliant with Con Edisons  Requirements. 
A full report of the test results, the settings and the general conditions of the equipment will be presented to the Facility Manager in writing upon completion of the work

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is committed to using cutting-edge technologies and scientific talent in its quest to make America safer. The DHS Directorate of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) is tasked with researching and organizing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the United States and leveraging these existing resources into technological tools to help protect the homeland.<br /><br />DHS S&amp;T's Borders and Maritime Security Division (BMD) supports the DHS S&amp;T mission by developing and transitioning capabilities that are successfully demonstrated to improve the security of our nation's terrestrial and maritime borders.<br /><br />DHS/S&amp;T/BMD is seeking information on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) ground surveillance radar (GSR) systems capable of detecting, tracking and reporting the presence of personnel and vehicle traffic. DHS S&amp;T is issuing this RFI to determine availability of these systems. Several of these devices may be selected for additional characterization.<br /><br />There is a need to provide wide-area situational awareness of human and vehicle traffic in the vicinity of the U.S. border. The focus of this request is identification of GSR systems capable of detecting, tracking and reporting human and vehicle movement in border environments, with an emphasis on areas where the radar will have to perform in the presence of windblown rain and foliage clutter, and with frequent target obscuration by foliage or terrain. Along with high probabilities of detection against targets of interest, there is a need for low false alarm rates. GSR systems will typically be collocated with camera systems to which they must provide cueing information to allow visual target identification.<br /><br />See attached Request For Information (Word document) for details.<br />

<p>Requirement:</p>
<p>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Casper, WY that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 13,500 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 11,775 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for three years with cancelation rights after eighteen months. The space must be available for occupancy by October 1, 2010. The delineated area currently includes the central business district of the City of Casper, WY and the neighboring redevelopment area know as the Old Yellowstone District. The Government reserves the right to modify the delineated area based upon the results of this advertisement as well as other information gained prior to issuance of a solicitation.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull;Eighteen reserved surface parking stalls for official Government vehicles.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE NOTICE<BR><BR>The Government intends to sole source award a firm fixed price services contract for Project Management Support Services for Railroad Coordination Various Projects for the Hurricane Protection Office, Vicinity of New Orleans, LA.  These services are required with the property owner of the railroad.<BR><BR>The railroad will participate in pre-construction meetings with the Corps (USACE) and the construction contractors.  They will also provide on-site services to assure that the contractors operations do not interfere with the railroads operations.  Some aspects of the work are specialized such as driving battered piling adjacent to and extending over the railroad tracks.<BR><BR>The line of protection for the hurricane protection system for the New Orleans East and New Orleans Metro polders crosses the Railroads tracks in two (2) locations and runs parallel to the tracks for over six (6) miles.  The gaps in the line of protection are closed by the means of steel flood gates.  The gate structures are on Railroad property by permit and the levee runs parallel to and adjacent to the Railroads property.  A floodwall is being built on top of the levee through most of this reach.  The Railroad expertise is needed because the project impacts their property.<BR><BR>Not having a contract in place with the Railroad could cause substantial indefinite delay of the construction of the hurricane protection in these reaches.  This would result in a gap in the line of protection thus negating the billions of dollars worth of public investment and endangering human life and property.<BR><BR>Government shall evaluate offer on Price Alone.  Technical and past performances when combined are less significantly important than Price.<BR><BR>Point of contact for this notice is Mr. Larry Magee at (504) 862-2172, email Larry.Magee@usace.army.mil.  Responses to this notice must be received by 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, March 26, 2010.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The USCG Aircraft Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers described as follows: Repair of the Garrett/Honeywell engine electronics for the ATF3-6-4C advanced turbofan engine, and the GTCP36-100C airborne auxiliary power unit (APU) and associated components utilized on the HU-25 model aircraft. The electronic components provide the HU-25 aircraft with automatic control and monitoring of the engine and APU throughout the entire operating envelope of the aircraft. This includes both ground and airborne operation.. The USCG operates a fleet of 17 HU-25 aircraft, with 14 of those operational at any given time, and three undergoing Periodic Depot Maintenance (PDM). The USCG fleet of HU-25 aircraft is a military adaptation of the Falcon 20 aircraft manufactured by Avions Marcel Dassault Brequet of France. Nomenclature and part numbers that will be on the schedule of repairs are as follows: Engine Electronic Control (EEC), P/N 2101484-14; APU electronic control, P/N 2117406-5, and 2117406-6; Engine synchronizer, P/N 2101714-1-1. Failure to provide repaired parts would ultimately result in grounded aircraft, denying the use of these aviation assets to the operational Commander, and limiting the execution of USCG missions. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the engine electronics is Honeywell International, 1300 West Warner rd. Tempe, AZ. 85285-2200. The USCG will not be able to provide manuals or drawings for this requirement. Interested parties must have access to the OEM data and manuals. Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product or repair. Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Additionally detail if the repairs/overhauls your company has completed on similar engine electronics has been qualified for use in any DOD or Federal Government Aircraft. The USCG believes the applicable NAICS code is 336412 - Aircraft engine parts. Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions. After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO). Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the USCG to award any contract.

The USCG Aircraft Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers described as follows: Repair of the Garrett/Honeywell Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and associated components utilized on the HU-25 model aircraft. The APU provides the HU-25 aircraft with pneumatic power for operation of cabin environmental air systems, and window heat and defog. It also provides mechanical power for operation on an AC and DC generator to operate the aircraft electrical and avionics systems. This power is required both on the ground and while airborne. The USCG operates a fleet of 17 HU-25 aircraft, with 14 of those operational at any given time, and three undergoing Periodic Depot Maintenance (PDM). The USCG fleet of HU-25 aircraft is a military adaptation of the Falcon 20 aircraft manufactured by Avions Marcel Dassault Brequet of France. Nomenclature and part numbers that will be on the schedule of repairs are as follows: APU, P/N 3800030-2-1; Fuel Control, P/N 3882600-3; Fuel Nozzle Assembly, P/N 3830061-5; and Combustion Chamber, P/N 3830077-3. While failure to provide repaired parts would not ultimately result in grounded aircraft, it does limit ground operations of the aircraft, and removes redundant airborne systems availability. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the APU is Honeywell International, 1300 West Warner rd. Tempe, AZ. 85285-2200.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM)/PEO Land Systems (PEO LS) is seeking information regarding the capabilities of medium tactical vehicles currently in production.

The geographic location of the identified renewable energy townships is primarily in areas having the potential for renewable energy in support of the current administrations energy priorities and in the transmission of that energy.  This project will inventory, validate and verify BLM public land records by comparing the automated LR2000 data against the manual public records for approximately 1,700 townships in the State of Nevada.
The vendor will validate all pending and authorized renewable energy cases. Compare case legal land descriptions against the manual public land records (Master Title Plats, Use Plats, Historical Index and Controlled Document Index, case file) to assure data contained in LR2000 accurately and precisely reflect the official records in accordance with standards. In addition, assure all locations can map in GIS and identify any cases that are not on public domain open to renewable energy development.  Validate existing public land records and LR2000 data that impact renewable energy development. Ensure that all title and use cases are accurately noted on the manual records and the corresponding LR2000 cases are validated.  Validate the reserved federal subsurface mineral ownership on split estate lands this will include approximately 1,700 townships.  Develop township plots that spatially display cases that have been validated. This will allow for a visual inspection of validated data and will confirm the cases ability to map properly

The research study will be conducted through intensive case studies with a subset of 15 communities and 6 states chosen from among those funded under the CPPW initiative. As part of the case study, initial site visits will be conducted during the first year of funding to determine the "baseline" situation, and then follow-up case studies will be conducted after the conclusion of the sites' funded period (24 months) to determine the degree to which the strategies have been effectively implemented and the patterns and factors leading to effective implementation. The task order work will provide for oversight and implementation of the initial/baseline and follow-up site visits, produce interim/baseline reports and follow-up reports and cross-site analyses for all sites visited. The findings of the research will also be converted into peer-reviewed articles.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals, not is a solicitation available.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: The period of performance shall be thirty-six months.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing to Maryann Schlemmer at aaq8@cdc.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to establish a GSA BPA with McKinsey and Company to provide professional Business Process Improvement (BPI) and strategic management consulting services.  The goal of this initiative is to implement a vigorous and continuous business management and quality improvement process for the policies and practices that govern the management of our resources.  Our goal is to ensure that the decisions made by the FDA can be tracked through and supported by clearly communicated and documented processes in an integrated and transparent manner.  Particular emphasis has been placed on food protection; import safety; pre-market application and associated approval processed; and post-market risk surveillance and communication.  

The FDA intends to include open market items on the award to McKinsey and Company.  The open market items include any travel needed for the successful completion of individual orders placed under the BPA.  The travel will be at a not to exceed amount determined by the Government in accordance with GSA travel rates.  The FDAs original requirement was competed among four GSA schedule holders.  Only one, McKinsey and Company, submitted a bid, which included open market items needed for this requirement.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation document is available.  However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give notification to the Contract Specialist by 8:00am eastern time on March 26, 2010.  Interested firms must furnish supporting evidence with sufficient detail to demonstrate its ability to comply with the requirement described above.  Interested firms may email the information to the Contract Specialist, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Attn:  Keith Austin at keith.austin@fda.hhs.gov.

The FDA will review all responses received; however, the Government retains the sole discretion not to further compete the proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice.  If the FDA does not receive any responses, the FDA will proceed with BPA award to:  McKinsey and Company

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), </span><span style="color: black;">is offering the opportunity to license its actuators made from nanoporous materials technology.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Actuators convert an external electrical signal into a mechanical force by changing their dimensions.<span class="Temporary"> Well-known examples for such devices are piezoelectric actuators where the dimensional changes are caused by the polarization of the whole material. The effect is</span> used in various industrial and scientific applications such as nanopositioning in semiconductor manufacturing, microfluidic motors and valves, etc. Another promising actuator concept relies on <span class="Temporary">charge-induced changes of surface stress. This actuation concept requires the use of high-surface-area materials such as c</span>arbon nanotube based materials that have been extensively researched for this application, but that may prove to be too costly and to difficult to load in compression.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">To make surface-stress-induced actuation a viable technology, one needs a material that, besides an extremely high surface area, is <span class="Temporary">light-weight, mechanically robust, inexpensive, thermally stable, and environmentally friendly, ideally carbon based. Furthermore, inexpensive, large monolithic pieces should available. LLNL has developed such a material using its expertise in sol-gel chemistry and in making </span>highly porous, low-density, lighter-than-air structures that are useful at LLNL in laser target fabrication, energetic composites, sensors, ceramics, and coatings. LLNL has a long history in tailoring the properties of these materials for different applications.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span>: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">LLNL has developed novel nanoporous carbon materials for the surface-stress-induced actuator technology. The morphology of these materials has been designed to combine high surface area and mechanical strength. The process allows for the fabrication of large monolithic pieces with low densities and high structural integrity. One actuation technology relies on electrochemically- induced changes of the surface stress, another on surface-chemistry-induced changes in surface stress. The latter allows for a direct conversion of chemical energy into a mechanical response.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  

This notice is issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and FAR Subpart 5.705.  

Contract Number SB1341-07-CQ-0016, Task Order Number 69225 was awarded to Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO on July 10, 2009 in the amount of $455,379.00.  Modification T001 was executed on January 28, 2010.  

Work under Task Order Number 69225 will develop and deliver a detailed design for the upgrade of the plumbing system of the thermal shield at the NIST/Center for Neutron Research.  The upgrade requires that cooling water be administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure, as in the present mechanical configuration.

Modification T002 shall be executed to extend the period of performance, and incorporate a training requirement.   

The period of performance shall be changed as follows:
FROM: July 10, 2009 through April 14, 2010;
TO:  July 10, 2009 through May 24, 2010.

The Department of Commerce (DOC)/Inspector General (IG) requires that all Contractors who receive or have received contracts/ orders funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), train their employees on fraud, waste and abuse and be provided a copy of power point presentation developed by the DOC/OIG.  This requirement will be incorporated via this modification. 

The total amount of the Task Order shall remain unchanged at $503,177.00.

In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii), this modification is being executed  against a task order awarded on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract and all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries, national Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA 98115 on a sole source basis with Oregon State Department of Fish and Wildlife. <br />The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of National Marine Fisheries, National Marine Mammal Laboratory has a requirement for a study of Steller Sea Lion Survival in Oregon and Northern California as follows:<br />Project Objectives<br />1) In odd-numbered years (2011, 2013, etc.), capture and mark up to 200 Steller sea lion pups at the Rogue Reef rookery in southern Oregon.<br />2) Monitor the presence, distribution, and abundance of Steller sea lions in general and marked individual animals in particular, using remote video cameras installed at Rogue Reef, and by using shore and boat-based observations throughout the study area (northern California and Oregon).<br />3) Record other data and observations as determined by cooperative planning discussions between NMML and the vendor (e.g. pup production, mortality, etc.).<br />4) Provide summaries of field work and observation data for the vendor and NMML databases, and prepare annual reports summarizing project activities.<br />5) Use resight data of marked individuals to estimate population vital rates in conjunction with NMML staff.<br />Work to be accomplished<br />1) The vendor will establish and maintain a field project office and storage/work facilities for this project in Gold Beach, Oregon.<br />2) This project will be cooperatively directed by the vendor program leader and by NMML staff. Data analyses will be conducted cooperatively by staff from both agencies.<br />3) The vendor and NMML will work cooperatively to conduct observations and data collection activities in the study area.<br />4) Vendor will consult regularly with NMML staff regarding observation schedules, data collection protocols, data analyses, and preparation of data summaries and project reports.<br />5) Vendor and NMML will cooperatively plan and conduct biennial sea lion pup capture and marking activities. Both agencies will provide staff and logistics support to accomplish annual field research activities.<br />6) Vendor and NMML will coordinate and implement field resighting efforts from Northern California through Washington. Vendor and NMML will provide research staff to assist with this effort when it involves extensive boat and field work, primarily in the late spring through early fall period.<br />7) NMML will assist the vendor with the analysis of data and the preparation of reports for publication, with the understanding that the vendor is expected to be the lead author for these publications.<br />In cooperation with the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has been monitoring pinniped distribution, abundance, population trends, seasonal movements, and food habits in Oregon since 1984. In the summer of 2001, ODFW and NMML initiated a new study of the survival of the threatened Steller sea lion in the Pacific Northwest. Steller sea lions occurring from Northern California through Oregon constitute the largest and most important reproductive aggregation of this species in U.S. waters south of Alaska. In cooperation with other studies conducted by NMML and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game throughout the Steller sea lion's range, this project is aimed at obtaining comparative information on population vital rates such as age-specific survival, age at first reproduction, fecundity, as well as describing seasonal movements and distribution. This information, collected from a sub-population that is healthy and increasing in abundance, will be of great value in the assessment of causes of the significant population decline that has been observed from the Western Gulf of Alaska through the Aleutian Islands. In order to conduct this research and provide the services required, the vendor must be listed on and possess the proper research permits including a NMFS MMP A research permit, an access permit from the USF &amp; WS and an Endangered Species Act Research Permit to conduct branding studies of Steller sea lions on Rogue Reef. ODF&amp;W possesses all these permits and listed as a CIon the NMFS MMPA Steller sea lion research permit. The ODF&amp;W also has a district office in Gold Beach to provide support to the project, has 8 years of experience with operating the computer controlled remote video system used to monitor animals on Rogue Reef, and maintains the marked animal resighting data base required to analyze for estimates of survival rates of Steller sea lions in Oregon and Northern California. <br />The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance of twelve months from date of award with one option year. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $7.0M. <br />This notice represents the only official notice.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement to purchase an automated hand hygiene documentation and reminder system. It is the Government's intention to solicit and negotiate only with Massachsetts General hospital for this equipment. A sources sought notice was previously published on Feb 17, 2010 for 7 days for the below requirement. Only 1 response was received from a foreign vendor not eligible to compete.This is not a solicitation; it is a notice of intent to sole source for an Automated Hand Hygiene Documentation and Reminder System    The Veterans Hospital intends to sole source with Massachusetts General Hospital for an automated hand-hygiene documentation and reminder system to be installed in part of the West Roxbury VA hospital.  At a high level the system must consist of the following components. A hand-hygiene dispenser transmitter that transmits a low-power ultrasound signal when the lever of the dispenser is pulled to dispense soap or alcohol sanitizer. A protection zone transmitter that transmits an ultrasonic signal to establish an area of protection (typically a patient bed).A domino-sized clinician-worn badge that contains in its memory an expected hand-hygiene protocol and records when the various ultrasonic signals are received; it beeps to remind the clinician if proper hand-hygiene has not occurred and documents these interactions. 	A computer program to download data from the badge (via a USB cable) to an Excel spreadsheet for subsequent analysis.  the system must be installed per VAs standards.  There will be a full-time manager at VA who will be responsible for on-site maintenance and support of the project.  The description below and costing is based on a typical room.  The functional performance criteria is defined as the ability to automatically document when a clinician has entered a protected zone in a room as well as if they have performed proper hand hygiene.  The system installed should consist of the following components.  	Protection zone transmitters to create zones; these are typically mounted some place within the room itself.  The number will vary from one to four transmitting units depending on the physical size of the room, if the room has one or two patients, has a bathroom, etc. 	Hand hygiene transmitters to document soap/gel use; these are mounted next to the hand hygiene dispensers.  The number will vary in accordance with the number of hygiene dispensers.  In some cases there dispensers associated with a given room may be in the hall outside of the room. 	Clinician badges are worn by the clinicians.  The actual number will depend on the care unit, shift, etc. but it is estimated at two badges per patient room. 	Software application to download information from badges.  Note that the same software is used for all the rooms, so only one software application is needed for the entire system 	Installation of the system by vendor 	Free software upgrades for a period of one year after installation  Estimated Cost:  $12,959.00 per room not to exceed $129,583.00 Invoices will be submitted on the basis of individual room blocks installed with the system described above. Again this is a notice of intent to sole source.    Inquires/information received after established deadline of March 30, 2010 3pm EST shall not be considered.

STATEMENT OF WORK FOR
HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL ALTITUDE TRAINING
1.0 Scope	
Naval Special Warfare Training Detachment ONE (NSWTD-1) conducts 21 days of continuous special reconnaissance (SR) unit level training (ULT) Tooele, Utah. This training will be conducted three times in the remainder of Fiscal Year 2010.  Contractor is to assist with Part One of this ULT, which consists of six (6) days of complex High Environmental Altitude Training (HEAT) and one (1) day of site survey/conditions per training block.  Part One of the 21-day training block must occur in the vicinity of Tooele, Utah, as the remainder of the 21 day training block will take place in this same location.  As Part One of training is completed, trainees transition immediately to the next part of the training. Contractor shall conduct classroom and practical HEAT evolutions. The Tooele area provides terrain and altitude similar to current deployment operations environment. In addition, Tooele Army Depot provides berthing, classroom, briefing rooms and other facilities at no cost in support of NSWTD-1 training objectives. 
2.0 Background

SEAL TEAM FIVE and SEAL TEAM SEVEN are established Echelon IV Commands under Naval Special Warfare Group ONE (NSWG-1) providing Operational Forces to Special Operation Forces (SOF) Units forward and Geographic Combatant Commanders in support of multiple theaters.  These commitments require the capability to conduct operations in varied hostile environmental and terrain conditions, which, if personnel are not properly trained and equipped, will reduce operational capabilities, personnel safety, and mission success. The varied steep and high altitude terrains encountered during tactical operations requires the education and training of Naval Special Warfare personnel in the use of specialized equipment and how to move tactical elements, supporting elements, and detained personnel without relinquishing security and tactical advantage.  Operations conducted in these vertical areas require technical equipment, knowledge and demonstrated skills to ensure the safety of individuals and units alike. Contractor services will act as a force multiplier, enhancing unit capabilities and improving readiness and effectiveness of NSWG-1 by providing technical and tactical resources. Contractor support is critical in assisting NSWG-1 and NSWTD-1 in meeting emerging mission essential requirements.

Pressure washing is an effective way to remove certain types of aquatic invasive species from recreational boats and trailers, helping to prevent the spread of harmful organisms.  The Ottawa National Forest seeks to acquire multiple portable trailer-mounted high-pressure washing units with hot water capability for use in watercraft decontamination.

The Ottawa National Forest will conduct a boat cleaning demonstration project beginning in May 2010.  These trailer-mounted pressure washers will be used for boat cleaning at boat launches, fishing tournament staging areas, and other public locations visited by recreational boaters (e.g., gas stations).  This is the first time the Ottawa National Forest has sought to acquire this type of pressure washer.  It is possible that in the coming years other national forests in the Great Lakes region will acquire similar washing units.

<p style="text-align: left;"><br />This is a reissue of previous solicitation number NIHDK2010223.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NIHLM-10-0054 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 221210 and the business size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to procure Liquid Nitrogen of 99.998% purity on a continuing basis (liquid converted to gas). The time frame for these deliveries shall be available: 365 days per year, 24 hours per day. NIDDK requires liquid nitrogen to be stored in two 3000 gallon tanks that is plumbed as both gas and liquid into Building 5 on the NIH Campus. One is a high pressure tank, and the other is a low pressure tank. Also, the liquid nitrogen stored in the 2 tanks is not interchangeable. This is a critical resource for scientific research in Building 5 and if interrupted this would shutdown several laboratories and research projects. This would result in significant damage to scientific equipment. Filling the tank is triggered by an "auto-sensing level indicator" that communicates by wireless telemetry. This telemetry is required because of the highly variable rates of gas usage in the building. The Technical Requirements: The primary consideration that the liquid nitrogen vendor must fulfill is that we require nitrogen (liquid converted to gas) delivered to our laboratories. The vendor must have the ability to deliver at anytime, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The vendor must meet the following: 1). Ability to provide service a large volume supply of Liquid Nitrogen of 99.998% purity on a continuing basis. 2). A favorable, verifiable, history of executing government contracts. 3). Must be quoted using the industry standard of price/ccf. 4). There are two 3,000 gallon tanks and anticipated minimum fill of 1,650 gallons per delivery. This requirement is for an estimated 171,600 gallons per year with approximately 1 or 2 deliveries per week. Delivery charges and monitoring charges as applicable should be on the quotation. 5). Because of the logistical set up on the Bethesda campus, deliveries must be made during off peak hours; the current delivery schedule is 11pm-7am. This prevents the truck from hindering other, smaller vehicle, traffic including freight deliveries and express deliveries by other vendors. Due to the possibility that access by tankers could be restricted during heightened security, it is necessary for the vendor to have a smaller vehicle that can be dispatched for emergency deliveries in the event that the larger tanker can not access the campus or provide a solution to address the situation. It is critical that we never run out of the supply of nitrogen. Telemetry Unit Requirements: Contractor must work with the telemetry system owned by NIH to monitor the liquid nitrogen levels in the high pressure tank. Technical Support should be available 24/7 in the event that there is a failure of the telemetry unit. Contractor will be responsible for having support Arrangements and a backup plan should the telemetry unit fail. Web portal access should be provided so that the end user can monitor the usage on the account. In the absence of web portal access, the vendor must provide the end user with bi-monthly usage reports. The Institute intends to purchase this product by full and open competition. This will be for a base year plus four (4) option years. The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. Sub paragraph (a) is defined as follows: "The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered." The following evaluation factors shall be considered equally: Technical Evaluation, Price, and Past Performance. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offer within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; 4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and 5) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions. Vendors must submit a listing of the most recent contracts/awards (minimum of 3) in which liquid nitrogen was purchased.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) and the reference number is HTC711-10-Q-D014. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38, dated 10 December 2009. The North American Industry Classification System code is 517919 with a business size standard of $25 million.
<p>USTRANSCOM and Surface Deployment and Distribution Command require the capability to globally track vessels. The contractor shall provide an automated, worldwide, hourly vessel tracking service to allow for in-transit visibility to the warfighter. Previous tracking capability was based on individual vessel &lsquo;pings' to buoys within various locations worldwide. Satellite coverage is needed to provide global data, not just within the range of buoys. The data that will be provided by this web-based satellite subscription provides web-enabled location and mapping services. The Government requires that no additional equipment be installed onto the vessels in order to support the coverage.

<p><strong>BAA TITLE</strong>: ROBUST FUZEWELL INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEM</p>
<p><strong>BAA TYPE</strong>: INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p><strong>BAA NUMBER</strong>: BAA-RWK-10-0004</p>
<p><strong>WHITE PAPER DUE DATE AND TIME</strong>: White papers are due by 2:00 PM Central Time on&nbsp;<strong>14&nbsp;April&nbsp;2010</strong>. Deliver to: AFRL/RWK, ATTN: Ms Melissa Campbell, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810. White Papers received after this due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). See Section IV for additional information. It should be noted that this installation observes strict security procedures to enter the facility.

<p>I. <strong>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong>:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Contracting Division (AFRL/RWK) is soliciting White Papers for the Fuzes Branch (AFRL/RWMF) on the following research effort: Robust Fuzewell Instrumentation System (RFIS). It is anticipated approximately two of the White Papers may be selected for further consideration, and their originators may subsequently be requested to submit formal written technical and cost proposals, with the intent of negotiating one contract for the RFIS program. However, the Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts pursuant to this BAA.</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Introduction</strong>: The Robust Fuzewell Instrumentation System (RFIS) program will develop an instrumentation package that will replace the fuze inside a penetrator weapon for both sled and flight tests. The RFIS will house a minimum of two (2) internal data recorders that will be used to measure and record deceleration data in testing of penetrating weapons. Such tests have high value and a need exists for a reliable alternative to existing methods which have proven to be inadequate. The RFIS technology program will provide increased reliability by providing the platform for multiple data recorders to be housed within the volume of a standard 3" bomb fuzewell.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Program Objective</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Program Objective</span>: The objective of this task is to design and develop a non-proprietary Robust Fuzewell Instrumentation System (RFIS) which can be fabricated at relatively low cost in a repeatable fashion. The RFIS will be strictly an instrumentation item and will replace the fuze inside a penetrator weapon for both sled and flight tests. Generally the primary data recorder is placed inside the fuze body. These recorders are hand-assembled units which are generally put together just prior to the tests because of battery limitations. Additionally, these recorders have generally used volatile memory which requires excavation and recovery of the data recorder within 30 days. Depending upon the range restrictions, target characteristics and depth of penetration this may not always be possible. Also, for flight tests, the flight profiles of the test aircraft have to be restricted because previous data recorders have not had temperature compensation circuits.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Program Objective</span>: The instrumentation system will be comprised of existing state-of-the-art harsh environment data recorders with sensors, power supply, interface control module, and carrier package. This system will house a minimum of two (2) independent internal data recorders with a goal of three (3) independent internal data recorders that will be used to measure and record deceleration data in testing of penetrating weapons. Such tests have high value and a need exists for a reliable alternative to existing methods which have proven to be inadequate. The RFIS program will provide increased reliability by providing the platform for multiple data recorders to be housed within the volume of a standard 3" bomb fuzewell. Prior data recorders have shown a moderately high failure rate during sled tests and an unacceptably high failure rate (&gt;50%) during actual weapon flight tests when used in penetration experiments into either rock or concrete. These tests are extremely expensive and cannot always be repeated due to fiscal constraints. The deceleration data is required to accurately model and predict the penetration capability of current and future weapons and to determine the limits of fuze and weapon survivability.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Technical Requirements:</strong> The RFIS design will contain multiple data recorders for redundancy and maintain the general form factor of the FMU-152 fuze to fit into current penetrator weapons. In conjunction with the development of the RFIS, tests should evaluate RFIS activation schemes for both sled and flight tests as well as impact survivability. The design shall be modular with cavities to fit multiple data recorders within and electrically interface with them for power, communications and any other necessary functions. Develop an Interface Control Drawing (DI-CMAN-81248A) to document mechanical and electrical requirements for both the overall RFIS as well as the internal recorder modules, plug-and-play compatibility with multiple internal data recorders, etc. The interface module shall incorporate the FMU-152 electrical interface and will communicate with the weapon system within the limitations of the FMU-152 electrical interface to provide information such as health check, system activation, and any other necessary functions. The RFIS external dimensions shall be established to allow installation within the standard 3" fuzewell of penetrating weapons (e.g. BLU-109, BLU-113, BLU-122, Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP)) and maintain compatibility with weapon systems which incorporate existing (e.g., FMU-143, FMU-152) and future fuzes (e.g., Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF)). The RFIS shall be secured within the fuzewell sufficiently to prevent movement within the fuzewell and warhead base plate through the target penetration event. Develop protocols for data recorder activation, functional testing, and impact survivability demonstration. Develop Finite Element (FE) model of RFIS for shock loading analysis and test predictions. Develop and breadboard interface module architecture. Information for interfacing with existing recorders is contained in the Annex. Other technical information is also contained in the Annex. Certified DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, is required to be submitted to the Program Manager and the Contract Specialist in order to receive the Annex. Once a certified DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, is received, then the contractor will receive access to the Annex. See paragraph I(11)(d) for further details on how to request the Annex.</p>
<p>(4) <strong>Program Tasking</strong>: The program is anticipated to include design, analysis, modeling and simulation, software development, test plans, prototype hardware fabrication and delivery, bench testing, laboratory shock testing, and cannon launched penetrator shock testing, sled and flight testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trade Study</span>: The contractor shall conduct a trade study of available recorders for suitability of use in the RFIS design. The contractor shall present results of the trade study to the Government for approval prior to the RFIS design.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design</span>: The contractor shall design a Robust Fuzewell Instrumentation System that will meet or exceed the technical requirements. The contractor shall identify all necessary elements and incorporate them into a system design.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Analysis</span>: The contractor shall conduct analyses and tests as necessary to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; predict and validate:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Survivability of the RFIS when subjected to the shock loads associated with impacting and penetrating hard and deeply buried targets.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. The functionality of the RFIS to perform within a weapon system both pre and post-penetration.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modeling and Simulation</span>: The contractor shall develop a Finite Element model of the RFIS to predict shock loading effects on the RFIS and provide this information for shock survivability design margin analysis.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Software Development</span>: The contractor shall develop and document all software associated with RFIS communications with the weapon system and the individual recorder modules, and the interface with the user.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prototype Hardware Fabrication and Delivery</span>: The contractor shall fabricate and deliver hardware according to the proposed test schedule. The contractor shall fabricate and deliver a sufficient number of test articles to accomplish all tests identified in the test plan, plus provide five (5) fully functional, complete test items for Government evaluation.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Testing</span>: The prototype units' performance shall be fully tested in bench-level tests at the contractor's facility and the test results shall be delivered to the Government within 30 days of test completion. Prototype design variants will undergo a series of shock survivability tests in a laboratory setting. The offeror may choose to have the Government conduct these tests at a Government facility, or if the offeror has the capability to perform such tests, the evaluation may be conducted at their facility. Laboratory test results shall be delivered to the Government within 30 days of test completion. Upon approval by the Government the offeror will refine the design(s) as necessary and fabricate prototype design(s) for evaluation in a series of field cannon tests. It is anticipated that up to ten (10) field cannon tests, two (2) sled tests and one (1) flight test will be conducted. Upon completion of field-testing, the offeror shall evaluate the results and incorporate lessons learned into a final design. The contractor shall provide support (personnel, equipment, and supplies) for all testing provided by the Government.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Low Cost Producibility</span>: The contractor shall consider design practices for low cost of producibilty in the design of RFIS. The contractor shall provide a unit cost of production estimate for low quantity custom fabrication (10 units).</p>
<p>(5) <strong>Test Support</strong>: The contractor shall be responsible for all test plans necessary for the maturation and demonstration of the hardware and software products to be tested. Contractor-generated test plans, as approved by the Government, will become schedule milestones and will identify test methodologies required to meet each major program milestone.

<p>(1) <strong>White Paper Evaluation Criteria</strong>: White Papers will be evaluated as to their projected success in achieving the objectives/requirements outlined in Section I, of this BAA, utilizing the Factors and Sub-factors below. Additionally, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">risk assessment</span> (See section/paragraph V(3)) will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Best Value to the Government</span>. Awards may be made without discussions. Factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> (1.1) Factor (1) Scientific/Technical Merit - Sub-factors (a) through (c) are of equal importance</strong>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Soundness of offeror's proposed RFIS Concept, proposed development, and producibility approach<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Soundness of the offeror's proposed approach to conducting the design<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Soundness of the offeror's proposed approach to performing test, evaluation and assessment of the design<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(1.2) Factor (2) Capabilities and Experience - Subfactors (a) through (c) in Factor (2) are of equal importance.<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Personnel/Management: Experience and capabilities of key personnel (both technical and management); experience and capabilities to manage technical risks, control cost and schedule. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Facilities, equipment and techniques necessary to accomplish the project.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Subcontract Management: Experience and capabilities to manage subcontractor performance, cost and schedule; nature and extent of reliance on subcontractor. <br /><br />Capabilities and experience may include unique combinations of these subfactors, which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives. Experience may be best indicated by work performed on programs of similar scope and complexity within the last 5 years. Any resumes should be in a separate Appendix, which is not included in the White Paper page limits. The Government team may request supplemental historical information if required to confirm/verify experience and capabilities.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(1.3) Factor (3) Cost</strong> - Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles. Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the third order of priority.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Proposal Evaluation Criteria</strong>: Proposals will be evaluated as to their projected success in achieving the objectives/requirements outlined in Section I, of this BAA, utilizing the Factors and Sub-factors below. Additionally, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">risk assessment</span> (See Section V(4)) will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Value to the Government</span>. Awards may be made without discussions. Factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(2.1) Factor (1) Scientific/Technical Merit - Sub-factors (a) through (c) are of equal importance</strong>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Soundness and scope of offeror's proposed technical approach and&nbsp;&nbsp; consistency with good systems engineering practices for development, testing, and future low cost custom fabrication.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Extent to which the offeror demonstrates that the defined requirements (See Section I(3)) can be accomplished with the proposed technology<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Scope, traceability and feasibility of proposed analysis and test plans</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2.2) Factor (2) Capabilities and Experience - Subfactors (a) through (c) in Factor (2) are of equal importance.<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Personnel/Management: Experience and capabilities of key personnel (both technical and management); experience and capabilities to manage technical risks, control cost and schedule.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Facilities, equipment and techniques necessary to accomplish the project.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Subcontract Management: Experience and capabilities to manage subcontractor performance, cost and schedule; nature and extent of reliance on subcontractor. <br /><br />Experience and capabilities may include unique combinations of the subfactors above, which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives.

The government team may request supplemental historical information if required to confirm/verify experience and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2.3) Factor (3) Cost</strong> - Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs. Cost realism includes evaluating if the proposed cost is realistic for the work to be performed, reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, and is consistent with the unique methods of performance and material described in the offeror's technical proposal. The total cost to be evaluated will include the cost of performing the contract, and any applicable offsets for GFP or acquisition of data rights.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>White Paper/Proposal Risk Assessment</strong>: White Paper/Proposal risk will be assessed at each Factor level as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. White Paper/Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. The following definitions will be used during the risk assessment:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3.1) <strong>High</strong>: Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3.2) <strong>Moderate</strong>: Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3.3) <strong>Low</strong>: Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>(4) No further evaluation criteria will be used. Individual White Paper/Proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other White Papers and Proposals submitted under this BAA.</p>
<p>(5) <strong>Review and Selection Process</strong>: Should formal proposals be requested based on the evaluation of White Papers, those technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time, using the same criteria stated above, and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Category I</span></strong>: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Category II</span></strong>: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Category III</span></strong>: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.<br /><br /><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</strong>:<br />(1) <strong>Selection Notices for White Papers</strong>: Those White Papers evaluated in accordance with sections/paragraphs V(1) and V(3) and determined to be of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Value to the Government</span> <strong>may</strong> be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the contracting or technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those White Papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>Offerors may request status of their White Paper no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Award Notices for Proposals</strong>: Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award, by letter or e-mail. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award. The Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts pursuant to this BAA.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Administrative and National Policy Requirements</strong>: The offeror will require a Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.<br /><br />(4) <strong>Data Rights Assertions</strong>: Any data delivered or anticipated to be delivered with less than unlimited rights must be reported in a separate, appropriately marked appendix to the final report of any awarded contract resulting from this BAA.<br /><br />(5) <strong>Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) and Voluntary Protection Program (VPP)</strong>: Eglin AFB is in the process of pursuing recognition under the OSHA VPP.

Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to Universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.<br /><br />(4) <strong>Item Identification and Valuation</strong>: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the Government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the Government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the Government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above.

If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of it's work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor. <br /><br />(8) <strong>On-Line Representations and Certifications</strong>: Potential offerors are notified that effective 01 Jan 2005 to be eligible for an award, they must submit annual Electronic Representations and Certifications, otherwise known as On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) via the Business Partner Network (BPN) at http://www.bpn.gov/orca .

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO.  01 TO THE	COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR DUMPTRUCKS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice servesas the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not beissued.The purpose of this amendment is to post the following technical questions received forthis solicitation with the answers provided by the MSFC technical end user.1)  Question: Why are we listing this as a bid for a 2008 model year truck?    Answer: Because it is possible that there are some new 2008 vehicles that areavailable for sale around the country.2)  Question: The engine is listed as the Mercedes 250 hp engine.  Is this the minimumspecification or a specific item?    Answer: This is a minimum specification.3)  Question: Could we verify the bed type as 10' dump bed?  They are typically 6-8 yardbeds.  A 10' Bed is meant to haul rock, dirt, and debris.  Does the 10' square meanfootage or does it mean shape?    Answer: They make dump beds that are 6-8 yard and 8-10 yard beds.  This requirementis for the 8-10 yard bed.4)  Question: Could we confirm the 242" wheel base, is this a crew cab chassis?    Answer: The specifications are for a 242" wheel base.  This is not a crew cab.5)  Question: The wheelbase in the specification is much too long for a 10 dump body.You would need a CA of approx 84 for correct installation. We have chassis available with a 96 CA which meet all of your specs with a couple ofminor deviations. Would you accept these chassis with a battery box built behind the caband 12 cab clearance? An 8-10 yard body is too big for a 25,500# GVWR chassis. This chassis would handle a 5-6yard body better. What should we quote? You do not indicate body material requirements.Would you want an all 10 gauge body? An automatic transmission costs much more than amanual. Do you have a preference? I would assume a manual as price will drive this bid.If the BBC dimensions is 106 and the CA is 84, a 190 wheelbase would be in order. Youcould accept longer if you would accept more cab clearance between the body and cab.    Answer: The MSFC specifications attached to this solicitation are legitimate for thesize and type of truck required.       The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on March 17, 2010.

And if there is, who is the incumbent?<br /><br />ANSWER 2:&nbsp; No, there are currently no vendors providing these services.<br /><br />QUESTION 3: Is NGA requiring assistance for ISO Certification or contractor support separate from the certification?<br /><br />ANSWER 3:&nbsp; The registrar will perform the assessments listed in the SOW. We are not requiring consulting services, the requirement is for ISO registrar services.<br /><br />QUESTION 4:&nbsp; According to "Section 3.1 Assessments" of Solicitation No HM017710R0010, it appears that the NGA is looking for a registrar and not a contractor to help conduct internal audits. Would the Government please clarify whether this is the case?<br /><br />ANSWER 4:&nbsp; The term "contractor" is a general term equivalent to "vendor" or "company". "Registrar" and "Certification Body" are more specific terms, but in the context of this SOW they are synonymous. A "company" not accredited as a "registrar" cannot perform the required services.<br /><br /><strong><br />___________________________________________________________<br />SECTION 3.8 OF THE SOLICITATION IS HEREBY MODIFIED TO INSERT THE NAME OF THE CONTRACTOR UNDER PROVISION 5X52.209-9004 - USE OF CONTRACTOR SUPPORT (OCT 2009).

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p><br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is&nbsp;31 March 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 25 March 2010. Contact Ryan Suchy at 252-334-5472 or ryan.m.suchy@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation. Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above address, facsimile at 252-334-5240, or at the following address: <br />USCG ALC<br />SRR Bldg 75<br />Attn: Ryan Suchy<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909</p>

<DESC><p>PROPOSAL DUE DATE EXTENDED<br /><br />SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE:&nbsp;4 March 2010. The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a cost plus award fee, non-personal services contract under full and open competition for Joint Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Management and Planning System (JSMPS)/Joint Integrated SATCOM Tool (JIST) Support. This is a follow-on contract to FA4600-05-F-0212. Performance will be for a five-year period. This will include a base period and four one-year option periods.</p>
<p>Services required within the scope of this requirement include technical support; hardware and software installation and integration; database and software development; continued development and deployment of existing JSMPS/JIST tools and capabilities; continued updating and employment of key SATCOM management and planning data; data manipulation and presentation; testing, demonstration, and fielding of developed software systems; and requisite hardware and software sustainment and support activities. JSMPS/JIST will be matured into a fully net-centric, web-enabled database and application suite with a hardware, software, and support architecture to meet the needs of DoD SATCOM stakeholders. The resulting tools and capabilities will provide a robust and secure environment for collaborative Electro-magnetic and Radio Frequency Interference (EMI/RFI) detection, tracking, analysis and mitigation. To accomplish this, JSMPS/JIST would expand existing capabilities encompassing assignment and execution data for all remaining DOD SATCOM systems, acquire needed data from existing and programmed SATCOM system management and planning applications and databases, and make this data readily available as an integrated and user-defined operational picture. To support better Intelligence Community (IC) participation in EMI resolution, JSMPS would be deployed on the JWICS network enclave with a cross-domain solution allowing for near-real time data refreshing from the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) JSMPS/JIST. JSMPS will connect to existing databases to provide data and products for Telemetry Tracking &amp; Control (TT&amp;C) data for all space systems to effectively support EMI resolution. Finally, JSMPS/JIST shall be available and sustainable while data is appropriately protected and secure.</p>
<p>On-site work may be performed at either of the following Government installations:</p>
<p>USSTRATCOM<br />Building 500<br />Offutt AFB, NE 68113-6600</p>
<p>AFSPC <br />Buildings 1470 &amp; 1471 <br />Peterson AFB, CO 80914-3050</p>
<p>All contractor personnel working any direct tasking on the project shall hold a minimum current SECRET security clearance (an interim SECRET clearance is acceptable for newly assigned personnel whose final clearance is still being completed). To work on-site within USSTRATCOM/J661 or within the GSSC, contractor personnel shall have a minimum TOP SECRET clearance and be eligible for Special Compartmented Information (SCI) indoctrination.</p>
<p>The RFP and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government-wide point of entry. No solicitation is available at this time. Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizops.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner. All associated documents will be released electronically. The NAICS code is 541512. Anticipated award date is Fall 2010.</p>
<p>Address questions via email to the contract specialist or contracting officer only. No discussions will be conducted telephonically.</p>

<DESC>Personnel Recovery Recapitalization Program (HH-60 Recap)
Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request For Information (CRFI)

INTRODUCTION The Air Force is planning to acquire a Personnel Recovery Recapitalization aircraft to replace the current HH-60G fleet. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI. This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition approach. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent perm! itted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government will determine that their contractor team members have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The Government will not reply to information received. The Government may conduct follow-on discussions with responders through individual one-on-one and/or collective "industry day" sessions.
It is anticipated the United States Air Force will replace an estimated 112 HH-60G air vehicles. The first lot is anticipated to be awarded beginning in FY12. To assist in this effort, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), 303rd AESW, 669th AESS/SYKA, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of providing eight (8) aircraft (excluding any RDT&E aircraft) with sufficient training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, technical data) to operate those aircraft.  The Air Force requires Initial Operational Capability (IOC) no later than 30 September 2015.
Meeting IOC at an affordable cost is critical. If the solution cannot meet all the capabilities, describe the capabilities your solution can meet if a contract award is made in FY12 and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities. If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired. Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities, rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other market information of potential solutions. &#8195;PURPOSE 
The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is (1) to engage industry early in the effort, (2) to identify sources that can provide capability if a contract award is made in FY12, and (3) to assist the Air Force in ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the HH-60 Recap capability. The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition approach. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP. RESPONSE GUIDANCE 
Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that 'publicly-releasable' and 'proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition. 
SSS/CRFI responses should include a: 
1. Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, and  large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB),  8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone) designation for NAICS code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company).

INTRODUCTION The Air Force is planning to acquire a Personnel Recovery Recapitalization aircraft to replace the current HH-60G fleet. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI. This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition approach. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent perm! itted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government will determine that their contractor team members have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The Government will not reply to information received. The Government may conduct follow-on discussions with responders through individual one-on-one and/or collective "industry day" sessions.
It is anticipated the United States Air Force will replace an estimated 112 HH-60G air vehicles. The first lot is anticipated to be awarded beginning in FY12. To assist in this effort, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), 303rd AESW, 669th AESS/SYKA, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of providing eight (8) aircraft (excluding any RDT&E aircraft) with sufficient training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, technical data) to operate those aircraft.  The Air Force requires Initial Operational Capability (IOC) no later than 30 September 2015.
Meeting IOC at an affordable cost is critical. If the solution cannot meet all the capabilities, describe the capabilities your solution can meet if a contract award is made in FY12 and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities. If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired. Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities, rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other market information of potential solutions. &#8195;PURPOSE 
The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is (1) to engage industry early in the effort, (2) to identify sources that can provide capability if a contract award is made in FY12, and (3) to assist the Air Force in ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the HH-60 Recap capability. The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition approach. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP. RESPONSE GUIDANCE 
Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that 'publicly-releasable' and 'proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition. 
SSS/CRFI responses should include a: 
1. Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, and  large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB),  8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone) designation for NAICS code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company). 
2. Responses are limited to 30 pages and must be received by 12:00 Eastern Time 13 April 2010. Responses must be submitted via e-mail with a CD copy by regular mail in text searchable Portable Document Format (.pdf). 
3. Responses should be sent to the Contracting Officer, Jim Dinwoody, 669th AESS/SYKA, james.dinwoody@wpafb.af.mil, 1895 Fifth Street, Building 46, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7233.

<DESC>The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding a requirement to provide follow-on non-contractor logistics support for the LTPS Advanced Targeting Pods (ATP) currently integrated on the following platforms:  F-15E, F-16 (all Blocks), B-52, and A-10.

<DESC>The National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is soliciting qualifications from firms to provide Engineering-Construction and System Integration services for the 5 MW Dynamometer Spin Test Facility.  NREL will select qualified firms from the RFQ to receive the Request for Proposal (RFP).  RFQ requirements are noted later in this document.  The release of the RFP is anticipated in August/September 2010.

SCOPE OF WORK

The intent of the RFP is to award a contract for Engineering-Construction and System Integration services for the 5 MW Dynamometer Spin Test Facility.

The RFP for the project will be based off of bridging documents.  The bridging documents will include approximately 50% design drawings, outline specifications and a preliminary systems integration plan.  The documents will also include the conceptual designs for the specialized electrical and specialized mechanical equipment.  The specialized electrical and mechanical equipment will include motor drives (variable frequency drives), dynamometer motor, gearbox, and non-torque loading system.

The scope of work to be included in the RFP will include:
	Complete the facility design, engineering and construction for civil, architectural, structural, mechanical/plumbing, electrical, fire detection and suppression, cctv, security, tele/data, test-in-progress notification and interlocks, overhead-crane, and other required specialty disciplines.  This scope includes general building requirements as well as foundations and structural support for Government Furnished Equipment.
	Installation of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  GFE includes motor drives (variable frequency drives), dynamometer motor, gearbox, and non-torque loading system.  A full list of GFE will be included with the RFP.
	Systems Integration of the specialty electrical and specialty mechanical equipment.  This will include design and installation of all interfaces between the GFE noted above and between the GFE and the general building services.

FACILITY DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this project is to construct a facility to increase NRELs testing capabilities for wind turbines.  The facility will house custom built and complex research equipment to test and certify wind turbines for our industry partners. The building may pursue a LEED Certification (actual level TBD).   The building will be located at the National Wind Technology Center, 18200 Highway 128, Golden, Colorado in Jefferson County.  The facility is currently estimated to be $10,000,000 including Government Furnished Equipment.  
The existing dynamometer building at the National Wind Technology Center (Building 255) consists of a 50 x 80 high bay pre-engineered metal building (PEMB) with a 20 x 80 control and support building connected to the high-bay.
The concepts for the new facility that are being considered are to add on to the existing high bay PEMB or locate a new, stand alone PEMB near the existing dynamometer building.  An additional control and support building will be added to the new facility.  The new PEMB is anticipated to need a 125 ton overhead bridge crane in. 
It is anticipated that the project General Building design and construction can start in advance of the Research Equipment Support.  See work delineation below.
General Building
The general build work includes site work, foundations, structural systems, building envelope, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire-suppression, life safety, communication/data, security system, bridge crane, and interior finishes required for the PEMB and control room. 
Research Equipment Support
The research equipment support includes foundations and structural systems, high-bay floor, specialized mechanical, specialized electrical, test article support, access for routing of controls and hydraulics, and systems integration.  The specialized electrical and mechanical equipment will include motor drives (variable frequency drives), dynamometer motor, gearbox, and non-torque loading system.
The floor in the existing dynamometer high bay consists of 5 thick slabs-on-grade with electric and hydraulic line trenches, concrete equipment pedestals and recessed bay cast metal plate.  The loads placed on the floor/pedestals will be in the 100-200 ton range.   Similar construction is expected in the new facility.

<DESC>This project involves the following work.

1.)	The cutting to specifications of 87 acres of vegetation, including trees and shrubs, in preparation for treatment by Removal by Cable Yarding (Highlead or Skyline) or Hand Treatment Methods. From Units 150 and 246 (a total of 27 acres), the Forest Service has a need for its sole use, the cut trees and chipped materials. Logs, and cut firewood, removed from these Units will be transported to a Designated Process and Storage Area in Kyle Canyon. Chipped materials from Unit 150 will be stockpiled at the Process and Storage Area near Unit 150. All cut and chipped materials from Unit 246, not chipped on site will be transported to the Process and Storage Area in Kyle Canyon. Cut materials from other units may be used by the Forest Service for its sole use when left by the Contractor at Final Acceptance of the Project. In the remaining 60 acres, some units or portions of Units may be suitable for treatment with small Cable Yarding systems. If the Contractors proposal includes a yarding system to be used when treating these acres, including ground-based or cable yarding, these systems may be used, otherwise units will be treated solely by Hand Removal or chip-on-site Techniques.
2.)	Trees and cut material over 1-inch in diameter and 3 feet in length, will be treated by Chip-in-Place methods, or removed from the unit and be further treated by chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, upon which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date or use it for its sole needs. Except in Units 150 and 246, the contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units or Process and Storage Areas prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit or the Process and Storage Areas.
3.)	The cutting, pruning, or limbing, of trees to specification and chipping into bins, transported to a Process and Storage Area, unless Chipped-in-Place. 
4.)	The cutting to specification of Shrubs and their treatment by chipping-in-Place or Chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area. Shrubs not listed in preferred species specifications will require cutting to specification also.
5.)	Specific Unit prescriptions follow in this project description.
6.)	In Units selected by the Contractor or designated by the Forest Service to be treated as Chip-in-Place, all cut materials and materials scheduled for treatment, will be chipped-in-place using a chipper deemed most appropriate by the contractor and described in the Request for Proposal (RFP). If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage, Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
7.)	There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit Prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated. Hand treatment is hand cut, hand carry all cut materials outside the flagged polygon and treated as described in the Schedule of Items. Contractor will not pile any materials inside of these polygons, but chipped materials may be chipped into the polygons if agreed to by the Contracting Officer.
8.)	Polygons are shown on the unit maps provided in the contract or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions, but others may only be flagged on the ground. There is no separate pay item in the Schedule of Items for these areas.
9.)	Trees and Shrubs are defined in the Contract Specifications.
10.)	Except for Units 150 and 246, wood and chips which have been neatly stacked or piled in the Processing and Storage Areas, is the property of the Contractor until Final Acceptance of the Project by the Forest Service. After Final Acceptance any remaining wood and chips may be distributed by the Forest Service under the permitting process or may be utilized by the Forest Service on its Projects.
10.) Quaking Aspen may be found in any unit and when found will require cutting to specification, unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Units which require cutting to specification if Quaking Aspen is present are identified in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
11.) Units may contain one or more dry washes or Designated Streams. In dry washes, avoid treating Riparian vegetation in and on the banks. No piling of cut vegetation is permitted in or on the banks of dry washes. The Contracting Officer will walk units with the contractor prior to work beginning in units containing dry washes or Designated Streams. Designated Streams are shown on project maps or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
12.) Riparian Vegetation does not include Conifer Species.
13.) Residential Housing or other structures are present in many of the units in this project and: H 4 -Table 1. Specified defensible zone space distances are applicable to these areas.
14.)  Access Roads to units and project areas may be primitive and in need of minor repairs. No road improvements will be permitted and access roads that have had work done on them to enable access will be returned to original condition. Any and all work on roads must be approved prior to work being done.
15)  Units in this project will not be released for removal activities all at one time, but instead will be released on a schedule that releases additional units as previously worked in units are completed. Contractor should indicate on the work schedule submitted with the RFP the sequence of units to be worked in and schedule of work and completion.
16.) Pay Item 110 - Tree Removal by Directional Falling Methods.  Trees scheduled for removal have been painted with a number such as (#3). During and after Unit Layout, some of these trees were felled by Home Owners in the area. Contractor will only be paid for actual trees fell and all Directionally Felled trees will be paid for at the bid price. Trees paid for under Pay Item 110, require that the contractor, fall, buck to lengths 20-25 feet, and transport to a Process and Storage Area designated by the Forest Service the cut trees. The designated Process and Storage Area is near the intersection of Highways 157 and 158 behind a locked gate. These trees are the property of the Forest Service. Trees fell under Pay Item 110, are the sole property of the Forest Service. At any time prior to the contractor cutting these trees under Pay Item 110, these trees may be felled by the contractor or others with no compensation to the Contractor. Units may contain Hazardous tress with no number (often painted cut) which will require falling for safety reasons. There is no separate Pay Item for these trees and they are the property of the Contractor until Final Acceptance of the Unit or Project.
17) All Units have a Limited Operating Period (LOP) and no work within the Units can occur prior to July 1. Contractor will submit a Work Schedule which demonstrates that all work in Units and on the Project will be completed prior to November 1, 2010.
18.) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer prior to award of this contract, contracts awarded on the Spring Mountain Natural Recreation Area will be considered concurrent with previously awarded contacts. Awarded contracts will not be worked on consecutively. The Notice to Proceed will be issued shortly after award of contract and completion date will not be extended
19) The Schedule of Items contains a pay item for Directional Fell Trees. These trees will be transported to the Process and Storage area provided in Kyle Canyon for use by the Forest Service. Additional trees on and off of the Project area may be designated by the Forest Service for Directional felling, bucking, and transportation to the Process and Storage Area in Kyle Canyon.
20.)  At the Prework meeting, the contractor will submit a work schedule indicating how they will complete the contract within the contract time. Each week the work schedule will be reviewed. If the work schedule does not indicate that the contract will be completed within the contract time, the contractor will adjust the workforce and methods of work, to complete the contracted work within the contract time.

<DESC>Please download the attached document for specific instructions and more details. Failure by any offeror to follow the instructions detailed will be interpreted as non-responsive, and will not be considered by SAIC-F.
<p>Project Title: RECOVERY - Development of rhIL-15 (E. coli) cGMP Lyophilized Clinical Product</p>
<p><br />Introduction</p>
<p>IL-15 is a 14 - 15 kDa member of the 4 &#61537;-helix bundle family of cytokines. It shares a number of biological activities with IL-2, including stimulation of the proliferation of activated CD4+, CD8+ and gamma-delta subsets of T cells. Recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) expressed in E. coli was manufactured by the BDP under cGMP to yield active rhIL-15 for cancer therapy adjuvant vaccines in human clinical trials. The purpose of this document is to describe the requirements for the development of a cGMP lyophilized product for future clinical studies.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>A previous study (data to be provided to the selected Subcontractor) demonstrated that rhIL-15 formulated in a Citrate, Mannitol, Sucrose, Tween-80 buffer was stable and retained its potency following lyophilization. Preliminary assessment of lyophilization parameters resulted in a uniform cake formation with minimal cracks. An ideal moisture value of &lt; 1% was not attained and additional cycle development studies are needed before GMP activities are initiated.</p>
<p>Project Management Plan</p>
<p>The Subcontractor will be required to submit a Project Management Plan (PMP) describing the means of accomplishing the Project Tasks. The PMP will include milestones to meet the Project Deliverables. Milestones will include but are not limited to 1) completion of the R&amp;D lyo studies and 2) completion of cGMP production. <br /><br />Risk Management Plan</p>
<p>The PMP will include a risk management plan (RMP) to identify potential technical problems that might arise during the course of work. The Subcontractor shall suggest solutions or alternative back up plans to address these potential problems.</p>
<p>Reports and Meetings</p>
<p>1. Project meetings will occur bi-weekly or as required by the SAIC-F Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (SAIC-F COTR).<br />2. Subcontractor will submit monthly technical and financial status reports to the SAIC-F COTR and SAIC-F Subcontract<br />Specialist.<br />3. Reports will include lyophilization cycle profiles, technology transfer report, certificates of analysis and a manufacturing report for the GMP process that will support clinical use of the resulting GMP materials.</p>
<p>Project Tasks:</p>
<p>1. Develop a lyophilization cycle based on the formulation previously evaluated by SAIC-F using the vendor's equipment that is translatable to cGMP production of 4000 vials with a fill concentration of 50ug rhIL-15/vial.<br />2. Recombinant human IL-15 will be formulated into the Citrate, Mannitol, Sucrose, Tween-80 buffer and provided to the vendor for Lyophilization-cycle development at a small scale of 10 - 20 mg; with an expected net yield of 200 - 400 vials 50ug/vial reconstituted to 1 ml). The components for container/closure are listed in Appendix A of this document.<br />3. The lyophilized vials will be evaluated for:<br />a. Reconstitution time<br />b. Acceptable cake appearance<br />c. Osmolality and visual appearance upon reconstitution to be free of particulates<br />4. Upon satisfactory completion of Task 3, samples will be provided to SAIC-F for analysis by (i) Potency, (ii) RP-HPLC, (iii) HPLC-SEC/LS, (iv) Protein Assay (Coomassie), (v) Moisture Content (Karl Fischer), (vi) Opalescence, (vii) Sterility, (viii) Endotoxin content.<br />5. Task 2 will be repeated with 200 mg rhIL-15 lyophilized to reproduce the small scale study results with an expected net yield of 4000 vials at 50ug/vial.<br />6. Criteria for deliverables shall include a lyophilization cycle of rhIL-15 that results in maintenance of the characteristics of the original dosage form upon reconstitution, including <br />a. Solution properties showing no particulates upon reconstitution<br />b. Stability/potency of IL-15 as shown by BDP analyses,<br />c. Structure or conformation of rhIL-15 as defined by item 4 above and<br />d. Particle-size distribution of suspension, with an overall residual moisture content of &le; 1%.<br />7. Preparation of cGMP batch production documentation. <br />8. Receipt and controlled storage of cGMP bulk rhIL-15 from the BDP.<br />9. Completion of aseptic vialing and lyophilization for rhIL-15 to net at least 4000 vials at 50 ug/vial.<br />10. Completion of all required CMC documentation of the lyophilized clinical product to enable an IND filing. This shall include regulatory documentation to cross-reference or submit the necessary Subcontractor facility, operation and quality system information for an initial IND filing.</p>
<p>Deliverables and Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>Criteria for deliverables shall consist of a lyophilization cycle of rhIL-15 that results in maintenance of the characteristics of the original dosage form upon reconstitution, including but not limited to: <br />a. Solution properties showing no particulates upon reconstitution<br />b. Stability/potency of IL-15 as shown by BDP analysis,<br />c. Structure or conformation of rhIL-15 and<br />d. Particle-size distribution of suspension, with an overall residual moisture content of &le; 1%.<br />Final inspection and acceptance of all work performed, reports and other deliverables will be approved by the SAIC-F COTR.<br />All cGMP deliverables are also subject to the final review of documentation and release by the SAIC-F Quality Assurance department.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance is 12 months from the date of award of the Subcontract.</p>
<p>Other Requirements</p>
<p>1. Facility audit for technical capability and cGMP compliance must be completed and found to be satisfactory to the SAIC-F Quality Assurance team prior to a Subcontract being awarded by the SAIC-F Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>2. Execution of a Quality Agreement prior to subcontract award must be made between the potential Subcontractor and SAIC-F. A template of the agreement is available at http://web.ncifcrf.gov/research/bdp/ (1- Click on the Request Documents button; 2 - search using key words "Quality Agreement" &amp; click on the search button; 3 - then click on the box "Quality Systems -Auditing/Oversight of Manufacturing Operations &amp; click the Add Documents button; 4 - fill out the remaining information &amp; click the 508 Compliance box.). A copy of the Quality Agreement should be delivered within 2 business days of the request.</p>
<p>3. This effort is to be solely funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Funds. The Offeror(s) with the <br />ARRA-funded projects will be subjected to all the ARRA-mandated activities and reporting requirements as applicable.<br />Tasks for this effort must be performed in accordance with the ARRA rules and regulations.</p>

<DESC>The due date is 11:00AM EST on 15 April 2010.<BR><BR>The Ohio Riverfront  Cincinnati, Ohio, Walnut Street Fountain & Grand Stairway project is located in Hamilton County, Ohio.  The work for the first phase will take place at a two level public open space near the Ohio River in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. It is immediately adjacent to the historic Roebling Bridge abutment and its recently added approach. To the north, east, and south, independent projects are being constructed in association with the Banks development including roadway improvements, multiuse development buildings with subsurface parking garages, and a realigned/reconstructed roadway. The construction work will require a significant amount of coordination amongst neighboring building project teams and City agencies. Specifically, an existing asphalt/concrete parking lot will be replaced; existing lagging and pile walls and an intricate web of existing underground utilities as well as a network of abandoned piles will be worked into upper and lower level park spaces. The two park spa  ces will be connected by way of stairways and an elevator. A grid of auger cast piles has already been constructed. The piles will support a park building housing a fountain equipment room; an area of which is dedicated to public restrooms and other future uses. The building's MEP system includes a geothermal well field and other specialized equipment. Above the building's insulated and waterproofed roof sits the upper level plaza and includes a customized elevator with glass doors,  a computer programmable interactive water feature, a custom fabricated steel pergola with structural glass paving and three structural glass paved balconies sporting a computer programmable water curtain cascading into a basin below, site furnishings/lighting, and tree planting areas utilizing an engineered structural soil matrix. Granite pavers cover the remaining area. A stairway descends 18 feet and is centered between water cascades both to the east and the west, each including programmable features. The lower level park plaza includes 10' to 40' wide stairways and a 60' long sloped walk connecting the park to the neighboring public roadway. A loggia directly below the pergola provides protected access to the fountain equipment building and public restrooms. Ten foot to 50' long x 1' wide water basins include computer programmable features. Solid and clad stone walls, site furnishings/lighting, an irrigated tree planting area, and granite pavers as well as concrete paving are also included in the construction. This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement. The proposals will be evaluated based on Lowest Price/Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process. This process requires potential Offerors to submit their performance and capability information to be reviewed, evaluated, and rated by the Government. Proposals will be evaluated by the government in accordance with the following criteria: Prime Contractor Past Experience and Prime Contractor Past Performance, Subcontractor Contractor Past Experience and Subcontractor Contractor Past Performance, Price, and Pro Forma information. The estimated cost range for this project is $10,000,000 to $25,000,000. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 237990, with a size standard of $33.5M.  The base construction contract duration is approximately 500 days.  The approximate issue date is 26 February 2010 and approximate closing date is 29 March 2010 at 11:00 AM Eastern Time.  Downloading of the project documents requires registration at the FedBizOps (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov.  This is a Full and Open Procurement; however, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 19.307(b), this project requires the HUBZone 10% price evaluation preference. This announcement serves as the advanced notice for this project.  Amendments will be available from the FedBizOps website by download only.  Prior to submission of proposals all contractors must have an act  ive registration in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) data base.  To register or update information go to http://www.ccr.gov.  Questions may be addressed to crystal.m.may@usace.army.mil.  This announcement serves as the advanced notice.

<DESC>RECOVERY - This action is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Actof 2009. Task 089-R is a research and development effort. Research funded by this taskwill focus on addressing the capacity challenges facing the US national airspace. It hasbeen forecast that over the next 15 years, air traffic in the United States will double,far exceeding the countrys current capability to safely fly aircraft. To handle thisgrowth, NASA is contributing to the development of the Next Generation Air TransportationManagement System (NextGen).The UARC shall conduct analysis of the traffic impact on regional air routes from theinsertion of one to multiple UASs. The data from the analysis may be used to design anunmanned flight trajectory that will have the lowest impact on the overall air trafficand to support the safety case for UAS access to the National Air Space (NAS). The resultof this task is data that can design safe and efficient flight paths for UAS that travelin regional air routes.This award notice is for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. The task order is issued under anexisting Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract NAS2-03144, which was made on a competitive basis.Due to the variability of this research and development work a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee taskorder was determined appropriate.  This modification includes both the core and ARPportions of the task.

The original proposal included four bid options plus the basic bid.  The requirement (RFP) included four Alternate bid Options, one of which was the requrirment for a partial geothermal heating/cooling system.  The fourth bid option was for the installation of a geothermal HVAC system for 3,00 sf of the total 21,600 square foot building.  To meet mission requirements of the Air Force Infrastructure Energy Plan 2010 and to optimize the energy savings of the geothermal system, instead of a partial geothermal system, an expanded system was considered encompassing the entire 21,600 square feet of building 5010.  J&A is posted on FedBizOps as requried.
