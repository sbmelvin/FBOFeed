<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCIRD/ID/VSD, 1600 Clifton Rd. NE, Atlanta, GA, 30333, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to Charles Rivers Laboratories, Inc., 251 Ballardvale Street, Wilmington, MA 01887 for Specific Free Pathogen (SPF) fertile chicken eggs for the production of high growth reassortant influenza candidate vaccine viruses and live attenuated influenza virus vaccine candidates by the World Health Organization.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Specific Pathogen Free embyronated eggs supplied by Charles River are used in human candidate vaccine production for influenza pandemic planning. If a different vendor is awarded the contract, the genetic content and potential quality of the eggs are<br />subject to change. This may negatively affect the yield of vaccine candidates produced and the Virology, Surveillance and Diagnosis Branch's ability to generate candidate vaccine viruses, which is mission-critical for the Influenza Division, NCIRD and the CDC. Continuing to receive Specific Pathogen Free fertile chicken eggs from the current supplier will ensure the consistent quality of CDC's influenza vaccine seeds and safeguard CDC's ability to meet the mission of influenza pandemic preparedness by protecting the United States and the world.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to Maria Shamburger, Contracting Officer, Reference 2018-21430, Centers for Disease Control, Office of Acquisition Services Office, ATTN: Maria Shamburger, MS: K14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with the Charles Rivers Laboratories as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>This Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /></strong><strong><br />The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) program anticipate issuing a Sources Sought Notification for the establishment of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Gauze Compressed through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on or about 25 October 2018. This is not a request for quote or proposal.<br /></strong><br />Examples of items for this Gauze Compressed product line could include, but are not limited to: single use, sterile, 6-ply gauze used for dressings and bandages, in various widths and lengths, in vacuum sealed, vacuum packed, or compressed packaging, and not made with natural rubber latex.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort will be to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL. The subject QSL will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the MSPV program which is executed by the DLA Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel.<br /><br />To participate in the QSL process <strong>vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Medical/Surgical PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor.</strong> Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.

<DESC>The FAA Office of Information and Technology (AIT) began a Workforce Development Initiative in 2016.  This initiative would refine the Workforce Strategy that defines future employee roles, functions and positions to support the overarching AIT strategy. As part of this strategy, AIT is looking to develop its employees into a highly engaged, innovative and customer centric workforce through career planning and/or paths helping them to develop the skills and competencies required to meet the demands of this future workforce. Succession planning of key jobs and leaders is also an important part of this strategy. Employees will become increasingly engaged as their future roles and paths to success are defined.  As this strategy is refined and implemented, it is imperative that the information is disseminated in a clear and effective manner to employees. Data to support this effort was collected through a series of listening sessions with managers and employees in AIT.  This data demonstrated that a primary need for the organization are Career Development paths that will assist employees in seeking job opportunities throughout the organization.  This should be completed by development of tools that will assist in identifying roles across AIT, self-assessing against recommended competencies and developing training to ensure employees are fully qualified as opportunities open within the organization. AIT has partially completed this work and completed a pilot within AIT that deployed a Career Opportunity Map and Career Assessment Tools within a portion of the AIT Organization.  At this point, a plan needs to be developed to fully implement this approach across AIT.  AIT is seeking assistance to assess the work that has been completed to date and identify activities, tasks, and timelines associated with developing a complete implementation plan for AIT, for potential deployment in FY19.  This work will include:
â€¢Completing the identification of current and future roles, by working with leadership in AIT to align roles with the IT Strategy
â€¢Evaluating identified competencies and recommending a process to self-assess, and have a manager, mentor or peer assess competencies
â€¢Identifying a methodology to match training opportunities to competencies and a process for employees to fully develop a training plan
â€¢Identifying options for tools and technologies for employees to identify career paths, assess competencies, and develop training plans
â€¢Developing a change management and communications methodology to accompany the implementation plan

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of capabilities from interested small businesses.  Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB/8(a)), Small Businesses, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) must provide their status and provide documentation if applicable.

Depending on the outcome of the market survey, the FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set-aside the procurement for small businesses; service-disabled veteran owned small businesses (SDVOSB) or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses.

1.	The work will consist of the Contractor, in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations, and the terms and conditions of the solicitation/contract, providing all labor, supervision, materials, tools, equipment, supplies, transportation, vehicles, licenses, certifications, permits, and other items, services and incidentals necessary to perform road grading and repair of two (2), possibly three (3), dirt road surfaces along Buffalo National River, Harrison, Arkansas 72601.  The roads are primarily a hard packed clay with remnants of SB2 base gravel and native sandstone.  

2.	Locations / Roads.   The roads are located in three (3) separate areas near the Jasper, Arkansas area.   The two primary road sections, Kyles Landing Road and Camp Orr Road, are the base requirement of the contract; and the secondary road, Pruitt Access Road, is an additive.  Pruitt Access Road will only be awarded based on the availability of sufficient government funding at the time of contract award.  Should funding become available for Pruitt Access Road after award of the primary road sections, the contract will not be modified to add the secondary road, Pruitt Access Road.   

	Primary Road Sections:

	a.	Kyles Landing Road (1.3 miles) Â¿ The dirt road is located approximately 24 miles south of Harrison, AR off Hwy 74.  The road work will be performed on county road 56 beginning at the park boundary marker.   Distance of section to be worked is approximately 1.3 miles.  (See Attachment 2 - Maps 1, 2, and 3)

	b.	Camp Orr Road (1.6 miles) - The dirt road is located approximately 25 miles south of Harrison, AR off Hwy 74. The road work will be performed on Camp Orr Road off county road 56 beginning at the park boundary marker.  Distance of section to be worked is approximately 1.6 miles.   (See Attachment 2 - Maps 1, 4, and 5)


	Secondary Road Section:

	c.	Pruitt Access Road (0.5 miles) - The dirt road is located approximately 14  miles south of Harrison, AR off Hwy 7 south.  The road work will be performed on county road 472 beginning at the park boundary marker directly off Hwy 7 south.  Distance of section to be worked is approximately 0.5 miles.  (See Attachment 2 - Maps 6, 7, and 8)
	
3.	Each road to be resurfaced shall receive a sufficient number of passes to accomplish the following work:

	a.	All ditches shall be pulled and re-established.

	b.	All ruts, potholes and corrugations will be removed from the roadbed by scarifying or other approved method.

	c.	All aggregate and other suitable material located on or in fill slopes, berms, ditch inslopes and/or ditch bottoms, shall be reclaimed and spread on the roadbed.

	d.	When grading, a minimum of three passes shall be made.  In areas where the road is in very poor condition or in areas of significant rutting, additional passes will be required.

	e.	All aggregate and suitable material(s) acquired from performing 3.a. through 3.c., are to be uniformly mixed and distributed over the entire roadbed.  This material shall be worked until a proper cross slope is established so that water cannot collect or pond on the surface.  This shall include shaping to prevent water from running down the length of the road.

	f.	Suitable material shall be placed over any solidly embedded rock so that no rock is protruding above the finished road surface.
 
	g.	All existing drainage dips, swales and other obvious drainage structures in the roadbed, shall be maintained to control surface drainage.  The finished road surface will have a cross slope that meets minimum Federal Highway and Transportation Department standards.

	h.	All culverts will be inspected and any deemed not suitable or are insufficient for adequate water drainage will be replaced.  The project will call for no more than three (3) to be replaced.  A determination to replace the culverts must first be approved by the COR before replacement.

4.	No undercutting at roadbed edges will be allowed.

5.	NO BERMS SHALL BE LEFT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD.

6.	Loose rocks 3 inches or more in diameter, on the surface or protruding above the surface more than 3 inches shall be removed from the roadbed.  These rocks can be wasted on the fill slope.  This often requires handwork.

7.	Roadbed width shall NOT be changed as a result of grading operations.

8.	PRIMARY ROADS:  Kyles Landing & Camp Orr Â¿ Additional Requirements

	a.	All road surfaces will be covered with a minimum of 4 inches of clay base once all maintenance grading has been completed.  The base coat will be watered and compacted using a sheeps foot or other compaction equipment.

<DESC><p>Background<br /><br />The Other Transaction Authority (OTA), 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b, allows the Department of Defense (DoD) to "carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components or materials proposed to be carried out by the DoD, or to improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces." Constant innovation and rapid technology advances are occurring throughout the world. Partnerships with commercial industry, the civil maritime sector, and others will be used to leverage these approaches and increase flexibility and agility, reduce cost, improve technology and capability insertion, and decrease program development cycles. The OTA offers an alternative to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)&#8208;based acquisitions, allowing for access to participation by non-traditional defense contractors with innovative solutions that may not normally desire to participate in government procurement. <br /><br />Requirement <br /><br />NUWC requires innovative technological solutions to address current and future security threats in the undersea and maritime environment. NUWC will be soliciting a list of topics on or about 25 July 2018. This synopsis provides notice of the topics solicited. Topic titles are provided below:<br /><br />AxB Performance Assessment Infrastructure Prototype<br />Unmanned Underwater Vehicle for Environmental Sensing, Monitoring and Prediction<br />Unmanned Surface Vehicle for Environmental Sensing, Monitoring and Prediction<br />Distributed sensors for Environmental Sensing, Monitoring and Prediction<br />Submarine Torpedo Defense<br />Improved Post-Launch Communication System (IPLCS)<br />Torpedo Operational Software Algorithm Development<br />Acoustic Response of Coral Reef Biota to Underwater Vehicle Traffic &amp; Disturbance<br /><br />Further details are provided in the attachment. Note that the attachment is Distribution D and therefore access controlled. If you do not have access to the attachment please refer to the below information concerning the Undersea Technology Innovation Consortium (UTIC). <br /><br />The Undersea Technology Innovation Consortium (UTIC) is a consortium of industry, non-profit, and academic institutions brought together for the purpose of conducting research, development and testing in cooperation with the Government leading to technology demonstrations in undersea and maritime technology applications and solutions. If you have any questions regarding the UTIC or are interested in joining, please contact Hannah.Bolton@ati.org &lt;mailto:Hannah.Bolton@ati.org&gt;&nbsp; or visit http://www.underseatech.org/join &lt;http://www.underseatech.org/join&gt; .&nbsp; Please note that in order to respond to the&nbsp; resulting solicitation, your organization must be a member of UTIC.</p>

<SOLNBR>18-233-SOL-00605
<RESPDATE>071618
<CONTACT>David Wilhelm, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014924643, Email david.wilhelm@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>Notice of Intent: <br />The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) within the Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Lincoln Groves under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the project entitled, " DTA Professional Services Contract: Technical Consulting Services" under FAR Part 15 procedures.
<p>This contract will require a technical consultant who will work with ASPE in providing consulting services to include: <br />- Production of analytical datasets using survey data and program administrative data that can be leveraged to answer policy-relevant questions.<br />- Independent, quantitative, statistical, and geospatial analysis.<br />- Studies of the feasibility of certain analyses and evaluations.<br />- Prepare written documents as needed (issue briefs, white papers, memos, reports) for internal and public distribution that clearly present research methods, findings, and policy implications.<br />- Summaries of recent research on related topics.<br />- Expert review of research products, both those produced by ASPE and ASPE-funded contractors, and those produced by other organizations.<br />- Advise the ASPE and other Department leadership on analyses related to the topics above and other high-priority issues as defined by ASPE.</p>
<p>Dr. Groves is a national expert on poverty analysis and statistical modeling of social science data. Dr. Groves has published numerous studies on the outcomes of low income populations, the relationship between economic opportunity and substance use, and family instability. He is an expert on several key data sources frequently needed for analysis conducted by our office, including: Current Population Survey microdata, the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, the National Corrections Reporting Program, among others. For a number of the types of reports we are required to produce, these are the only data sources available. <br />Some of these data sources are restricted use, and require special access and clearance through an Institutional Review Board. Dr. Groves is authorized to use all of these data sources, making him uniquely positioned to conduct this work.</p>
<p>Dr. Groves served as a research fellow with ASPE through our National Poverty Center grant program, from 2015 through 2018. He is intimately familiar with the current policy priorities of ASPE and HHS, and has been involved with several key initiatives related to the HHS response to the opioid crisis, family instability, and self-sufficiency. Many of the tasks he is expected to contribute to are continuations of projects he completed while a fellow. In summary, Dr. Grove's understanding of HHS programs and policies, statistical expertise, and access to restricted data uniquely position him to conduct the technical services required under this contract. Contracting with Dr. Groves will allow ASPE to extend the work Dr. Groves conducted for HSP and assure continuity and maximal efficiency for future projects related to opioids, poverty, and self-sufficiency. The nature of the projects under this technical assistance contract will require rapid turnaround often under short deadlines. Dr. Groves has produced work for ASPE under such conditions and is familiar with Department needs and processes for moving research quickly to internal and public products.<br />The scope of work is available and attached. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency, electronically to David Wilhelm at David.Wilhelm@psc.hhs.gov. Responses are due by July 16, 2018 by 12:00 pm EST. Responses will not be accepted after the due date. If no capability statements or proposals are received which specifically demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements above, the Government shall proceed with negotiating a time and materials contract with Dr. Lincoln Groves..</p>

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD to Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc (WEST).  The project will assess the impacts to birds of industrial-scale solar energy in southern California by documenting birds' use of these areas and any associated mortality. Successful completion of the project requires both new data collection and access to and analysis of existing data on avian-solar impacts.  This work requires conducting systematic bird use and mortality searches on solar facility property and in associated reference areas outside the facilities. Analysis of these data must control for various forms of searcher bias.  Also, new and existing avian mortality and natural history data from multiple solar facilities must be combined into a meta-analysis to determine what characteristics of solar facilities and species natural histories explain variation in mortality exhibited across solar sites at a regional scale.  The project calls for new data collection on avian presence and mortality at select solar facilities in southern California. Careful and systematic approaches are required to gather these data in a manner that is both representative of areas being surveyed and limits or accounts
for potential sources of biasÂ·.  Accomplishing this requires an understanding of study design considerations that apply specifically to data collection within solar facilities, the ability to identify and properly allocate resources to matched reference sites (i.e., controls), the ability to account for other forms of bias such as bird carcass removal by scavengers, and the statistical proficiency to analyze resulting datasets. WEST expertise for work with the wind and solar energy industries in assessing avian impacts of alternative energy is well established and spans hundreds of projects over many years. They are leaders in developing statistical methods for coping with bias in avian mortality searcher datasets and retain considerable expertise in metaÂ­ data analysis relevant to those required for assessing regional-scale factors influencing mortality at solar facilities. Unlike many consulting companies, much of WESTs research is published in the primary literature and therefore is exposed to the rigors of peer review. Indeed, study design considerations encountered during the conception of this project were partially informed by published work in various refereed journals by this entity.  This project will gather field data to assess avian-solar impacts locally at specific solar facilities, but addressing regional scale contextual questions concerning avian mortality requires access to already existing datasets. WEST has or is currently conducting postÂ­ construction monitoring for avian-solar impacts at most of the solar facilities identified as study sites for this project including Blythe, McCoy, Desert Sunlight, Genesis, and others. WEST retains exclusive intellectual access to the largest database of avian fatality data gathered at solar facilities, and such data are critical for understanding the regional factors that drive avian mortality across solar facilities in southern California. Over the years, the cumulative effort of WESTs field campaigns to date could not (and should not) be replicated, so in effect, access to these data would represents a substantial cost savings to the project as matching support in the form of monitoring costs (i.e., labor), equipment, and shared data. WEST also maintains facility access relationships with the solar industry that will facilitate the USGS team obtaining access to project sites as needed. Finally, WEST uses consistent data collection protocols across their project work. Using the same protocols for new data collection that are consistent with existing data ensures consistency of datasets that otherwise would not be possible if the project were forced to mix datasets from different sources. This consistency across datasets reduces 'noise' in any resulting analysis that would otherwise reduce our sensitivity for detecting the potential impacts to birds the projects seeks to explore.  This data is proprietary to WEST.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541620 Consulting Services, which has a size standard of $15 million. The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements per 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1).

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District has a requirement at New Cumberland Locks and Dam located in Stratton, Jefferson County, OH and Hancock County, WV to replace the existing centralized hydraulic system and hydraulic distribution piping used to operate the main chamber hydraulic equipment with a localized hydraulic system at the four corners of the main lock chamber. Each local hydraulic system would be dedicated to operate one miter gate leaf and one lock filling/emptying tainter valve.<br /><br />Specific features, important elements and details that are required as part of the lock hydraulic system replacement are:<br /><br />1.

HPU shall be immersible and will be located in each expanded miter gate pit and piped via the existing lock wall gallery or trench to each corresponding miter gate and tainter valve. The HPU will consist of a packaged motor, pump, reservoir, and related hydraulic appurtenances. The new HPUs will be connected to the existing equipment in scheduled phases. Minor concrete work will be required to expand and repair current recesses in the lock wall to accommodate this new equipment. One HPU would operate the machinery at one corner of the lock chamber, requiring two units on the middle wall and two units on the river wall. The existing river wall trench is covered by 4-inch concrete caps and plating, which will be removed. The trench will require material and service utility removal prior to installation of new electrical wire runs. The river wall trench shall be re-covered with new galvanized grating.<br /><br />3. HPU shall consist of a 60HP motor driving a variable volume piston pump capable of delivering 75gpm maximum flow rate. The HPU reservoir shall be stainless steel with secondary containment, and lifting lugs. Pump motor, pump, and fittings shall be mounted to the HPU. The manifold block shall be stainless steel.<br /><br />4. New motor control center (MCC) on the second floor of the middle wall Operations Building will serve as the power distribution point for the new HPUs at each corner of the lock. NEMA Size 4 motor starters and branch circuit protection shall be provided for each 60 HP motor. Modifications to the existing middle wall MCC will be required. All new branch circuit feeders will be installed from the middle wall MCC to each HPU.<br /><br />5.

Close coordination and construction activities will be required with the Contracting Officer and the Lockmaster at the facility. Since there is only one operable lock chamber, temporary lock closures will be limited to short duration closures (less than 8 hours) only to allow the phased switch over of the HPU equipment and controls. Long term lock outages will not be permitted.<br /><br />7. Disposal of removed materials, concrete rubble and other construction waste material will be at a commercially permitted facility licensed to accept the waste or recycled if applicable.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:
<p>Solicitation Number: TBD<br />Notice Type: Sources Sought Synopsis</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine<br />potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside, and by identifying contracting and subcontracting opportunities.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336413 which has a corresponding Size standard of 1,250. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>Program Details:</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a procurement for decelerons supporting the A-10 aircraft. The Government anticipates ordering the following National stock numbers (NSNs):</p>
<p>LH Decel 1560-01-591-4395FJ, Part Number: 162J712100-1001</p>
<p>RH Decel 1560-01-592-1976FJ, Part Number: 162J712100-1005</p>
<p>The Government estimates a minimum quantity of 40 LH and 40 RH with an estimated maximum quantity of 120 LH and 120 RH.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates utilizing a single award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with a 5 year ordering period.</p>
<p>The A-10 aircraft utilizes two decelerons which are located at the trailing edge of the outer wing. The deceleron functions as both an aileron and speed brake providing roll control as well as stabilizing dive speeds and reducing airplane speed in flight and on landing. The aileron and speed brake functions are actuated by hydraulic cylinders, with the speed brake hydraulic cylinder located internal to the deceleron. The deceleron is composed of four major structural parts; the upper speed brake, the lower speed brake, the aileron/deceleron trim tab, and the nose box (deceleron leading edge). The aileron tabs are located at the inboard 50% of the aileron span and are of the geared/servo type. The complete deceleron assembly and aileron trim tabs have balance weight installations to prevent flutter.</p>
<p>The deceleron leading edge is a one-celled box beam and is supported at the wing rear spar at four hinge points. The box beam also supports the two speed brake panels, and houses the speed brake actuator. The basic structure is a single spar with a curved shell nose skin. The deceleron spar is composed of four 7075-T73 aluminum alloy machined forgings which incorporate the aileron and speed brake hinges, joined by extruded 2024-T3511 spar caps and 7075-T6 webs. The inboard and outboard nose skins are each one piece formed 7075-T6 aluminum alloy sheets while the mid bay nose skin is comprised of upper and lower removable 7075-T6 panels and a fixed 7075-T6 chem-milled middle panel. The inboard and outboard main hinge fittings each incorporate an upper and lower speed brake hinge, an aileron hinge, and a speed brake bellcrank actuator hinge.</p>
<p>The speed brake panels are also the upper and lower surfaces of the lateral control ailerons, extending the full length of ailerons and are hinged just behind the aileron front spar. These panels are scissored open for speed brake action around four hinges (two main hinges and two auxiliary hinges). The main speed brake hinges are machined from 9Ni-4Co-.30C steel precision forgings while the auxiliary hinges are machined from 7075-T73 aluminum forgings. The upper and lower speed brake panels are bonded aluminum skin and honeycomb sandwich construction. The skins are made from formed, various thickness (0.087" to 0.016" in multiple steps) chemically milled 7075-T6 aluminum sheets. Each speed brake panel features multiple honeycomb core bays of varying density.</p>
<p>The aileron/deceleron trim tab is a movable, triangular, bonded aluminum honeycomb wedge with 7075-T6 aluminum face sheets and added doublers. It is continuously supported along its length by a "piano" hinge joining the tab front spar to the upper speed brake rear spar and extends approximately 50% of the aileron span.</p>

<DESC><br />The intent of this Request for Information (RFI) is to locate those with the capability to provide the following Product:
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal, Plant, Health Inspection Services, Center for Plant Health Science and Technology is seeking pricing and information on a Cryoprep Pulverizer similar to the Covaris CP02 for Nucleic acid extraction.</p>
<p>Nucleic acid extraction is best achieved when the protective coatings of the material are fully macerated. The best process for pulverizing material has historically been to flash&shy;freeze material in liquid nitrogen and grind using a mortar and pestle. This process suffers from user variation when grinding tissue and is an open ( exposed) process, increasing chances of leaking contaminants outside the immediate work area.</p>
<p>The CP02 Cryoprep instrument is calibrated to deliver repeatable mechanical force to deliver cryofracture of flash-frozen samples. The controlled, high impact force to biospecimens flash-frozen in at-PREP or tissueTUBE device results in the dry cryofracture of tissue samples without direct sample contact. This system closes the process, resulting in fewer opportunities for leaked contaminants to escape, and also automates the grinding step to reduce user variation.</p>
<p>The system allows for samples ranging in mass from 10 mg up to 2 g, which increases the types of samples that can be processed. Additionally, the sample bags that are unique to the system allow for flash-freezing prior to homogenization.</p>
<p>Information submitted as an "equal" product must:</p>
<p><br />(1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified for this product found at COVARIS Website <br /> http://covaris.corecommerce.com/CP02-Cryoprep-Pulverizer-p242.html</p>

<p>Please email all questions regarding subject item(s)  prior to Request For Information  closing date to Carol.Dingess@aphis.usda.gov.   Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.   Small Business concerns are encouraged to participate.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, but instead a market research method to gather information.</p>

<p>RE: W909MY-18-R-G016</p>
<p><br />Request for Information Announcement - Near Eye Display &amp; Optics of the Future</p>
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION: No award will be made as a result of this request. This RFI NOTICE is for informational purposes only. The Government is not obligated to make an award as a result of this request. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), or Request for Quotation (RFQ). No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses and is in no way obligated by the information and/or materials received in response to this RFI Announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>The information presented through this request will be discussed and assessed by U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) and other government agencies. All proprietary or competition sensitive information should be clearly marked for proper protection. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing a future Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives and/or Performance Based Specification(s).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Since the inception of night vision goggles, NVESD has been a leader in developing and fielding head/helmet mounted display technologies for U.S. Army applications and is currently conducting market research and trade studies of low power, low weight/center of gravity, high optical performance head mounted ocular and display components in support of NVESD and Project Manager, Soldier Sensors and Lasers (PM-SSL) augmented reality head mounted imaging system efforts.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>NVESD is seeking input from industry for innovative augmented reality system head/helmet mounted display solutions that will significantly reduce weight and power requirements while maintaining or exceeding existing night vision imaging system optical performance. This RFI will specifically address the system display output components: the display and eyepiece (or its functional equivalents such as a scanner/waveguide pair). Individual display or optical component technology solutions must demonstrate viable solutions for any required counterpart component (i.e. if an innovative display technology is offered, the display solution offered must also clearly identify any parallel optical component development required such that an affordable and manufacturable optics design solution can also be achieved).</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources who can augment the reality head/helmet mounted display/optics by providing the core components that will demonstrate enhanced Soldier survivability and lethality by integrating mobility sensor imagery, targeting imagery, geolocation information, situational awareness and mission command information under all visual environmental conditions.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Augmented reality display/optic component/system designs must meet the Threshold (T) specifications to be considered a technically acceptable solution. Objective (O) specifications are the desired performance parameter goals. Light security of both the see-through channel and the display channel is required across the visible through near infra-red wave bands (400 nm &le; VISNIR &le; 1100 nm). Optical design solutions shall not impair the characteristics of the see-through optical path (see MIL-DTL-43511 for guidance). Although no specific threshold or objective specifications related to compatibility with personal protective equipment are included in this RFI (such as protective eyewear and NBC masks), technology solutions shall either accommodate existing U.S. Army protective equipment or demonstrate how the proposed solution will supplant such protective equipment. The design solution must address any optical performance degradation that will occur when interfacing with such protective gear that nominally requires an eyepiece exit pupil of 14mm diameter at 25 mm eye relief.</p>
<p>Of the specifications listed below, contrast and resolution are considered to be the most important given a minimum 45 degree diagonal field of view (FOV) requirement. Note that all specification values refer to monocular (single channel) configurations. If biocular or binocular systems are offered, the requirement threshold/objective values figures will apply to each channel separately unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>&bull; Ocular field of view (FOV): &ge; 38 x 24 degrees (T); &ge; 45 x 45 degrees (O)<br />&bull; Ocular transmittance (see through optical path): TBD (Offeror specified design trade) (T)<br />o Note: If ocular see through transmittance will be variable, provide: <br />Minimum transmittance: TBD (Offeror specified design trade) (T)<br />&#61607;Maximum transmittance: TBD (Offeror specified design trade) (T)<br />&#61607;Spectral pass band: TBD (Offeror specified design trade) (T)<br />&#61607;Response time for state switching (transmittance: minimum to maximum transition as well as maximum to minimum transition_: &le; 2 s (T); &le; 100 ms (O)<br />&bull; Ocular transmittance (display optical path): TBD (Offeror specified design trade) (T)<br />&bull; Display/ocular assembly mounted mass per channel: &le; 250 g (T)<br />&bull; Display power per channel (at max luminance with 50% pixels driven): &le; 1W (T): &le; .5W (O)<br />&bull; Display/ocular assembly angular resolution:<br />o &le; 1.3 arcminute/pixel (T), 1.1 arcminute/pixel (O)<br />&bull; Display addressable gray/color level format: &ge; 24 bit RGB (T)<br />&bull; Contrast [(Target+Background)/Background]: 1.2:1 against ambient scene illuminated by 10K foot candle (T)<br />&bull; Display gray shades - video (night): 32 gray shades (no ambient) (T)<br />&bull; Display luminance (as measured at the eye) maximum (Night): &le; 4.2 fL (for 255/255/255 RBG White)<br />&bull; Frame rate: &ge; 60Hz (hertz) (T), &ge; 120Hz (hertz) (O)<br />&bull; Light security w/r external observer: No detectable visible emission from the packaged display/optic at a distance of 10m (T)<br />&bull; Cost per component (quantities of 1000): &le;$2,500 (T); &le;$1,000 (O)</p>
<p>DEFINITIONS:<br /><br />Contrast (C): ratio of the target of interest (target) plus the ambient background (background) divided by the background or C=(T+B)/B. In the case of no ambient illumination, this reduces to the display white level (W) divided by the display black level (B) or C=W/B.<br />Display optical path: optical path from the electro-optic image generator (display), through the ocular, and to the eye.<br />Display/ocular assembly: the monocular channel assembly consisting of the display appropriately coupled/mounted to the viewing optic.<br />Eye relief: The distance from the vertex of the last optical element of the eyepiece (or the farthest flange projection of the lens housing, whichever is longer) to the corneal vertex of the eye (distance measured along the eye/system optical axis).<br />Exit pupil: The diameter of the virtual image of the image source for a pupil forming system, or its defined equivalent for non-pupil forming optics such as simple magnifiers or waveguides.<br />See-through optical path: optical path from external environment (real world) objects to the eye.</p>

<CONTACT>Mary Prebensen, Phone 508-233-5724, Email mary.k.prebensen.civ@mail.mil - Anita Perkins, Email anita.a.perkins.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Announcement is to assist the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) to identify potential sources to provide footwear traction testing in support of the Army Combat Boot-Improvement Effort.</p>
<p>The Government requests that responses be submitted electronically to mary.k.prebensen.civ@mail.mil and anita.a.perkins.civ@mail.milby July 20, 2018 by 5pm EST.</p>
<p>Background: Army Combat Boots must provide Soldiers with durable protection to the feet, ankles, and legs without limiting his/her physical performance and capabilities. While commercial off the shelf (COTS) combat boots are often redesigned or upgraded to incorporate new technologies and/or materials on an often annual basis, the current generation of Army Combat Boots (ACBs) have not undergone any technical or material changes, aside from color, since 2010. New materials and manufacturing methods designed since that time may provide increased protection and/or improve Soldier physical performance compared to the current ACBs. The Army Combat Boot-Improvement (ACB-I) Effort will benchmark the current state of the art in combat footwear design, materials, and construction methods, as well as identifying and documenting performance gaps within the current ACBs.</p>
<p>One area of focus for this benchmarking will be the outsole. The outsole is the bottom layer of the boot, which provides traction, slip resistance, and protection from the environment. The ACB-I Effort will evaluate outsole performance by comparing the Coefficients of Friction (COF) of the outsoles of current Army issued combat boots against those of the most popular COTS combat boots. This data will aid in determining the ideal outsole compounds and tread patterns to be used for future footwear.</p>
<p><br />Requirements: The Contractor shall conduct footwear traction testing in support of the Army Combat Boot-Improvement Effort.</p>
<p>a. General Requirements. The contractor's primary focus shall be to complete heel traction testing on nine (9) boot items over a series of four (4) floor-contaminant combinations to represent actual environmental conditions. The contractor shall have skills in the evaluation of footwear tractions, shoe-floor angles, and horizontal sliding speed and their relationship to incidences of slip injury, as demonstrated though peer-reviewed journal publication.</p>
<p>b. Specific Requirements: The contractor shall:</p>
<p>(1) Conduct slip resistance testing on nine (9) models of Government furnished commercial off the shelf (COTS) boots and Army issued boots. All boots shall be size 10R.<br /><br />Test six (6) models of COTS and three (3) different models of Army issued right boots.</p>
<p>a. Conduct slip resistance testing using the Portable Slip Simulator and as defined by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) method B101.7: Standard Test Method for Lab Measurement of Footwear Heel Outsole Material Slip Resistance on Liquid-Contaminated Floor Surfaces: a downward force of 250 N; a toe up shoe angle of 17&deg; from the floor; and a velocity of 0.5 m/s.</p>
<p>b. Conduct testing for all boot styles on two (2) floor surfaces: steel and quarry tile. Testing shall be completed using two (2) contaminant conditions: water and no liquid (i.e. dry), on each surface.</p>
<p>(2) Write a report outlining test methodology, raw test data, summarized test data (e.g. means and standard deviations), analysis of the results and recommendations for future outsole designs and testing conditions.</p>
<p><br />Deliverables: A formal report shall be provided upon completion of testing. The report shall include an outline of test methodology, raw test data, summarized test data (e.g. means and standard deviations), analysis of the results and recommendations for future outsole designs and testing conditions. This report shall account for all test conditions listed in Requirements section B.</p>
<p>Delivery Date: The estimated period of performance is 6 months from time of award.</p>
<p>Government Furnished Property (Equipment/Materials/Information/Computer Utilization): The Government shall provide nine (9) combat right boots, including both COTS and Army issued styles that may be destroyed during contractor performance of testing.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
Storz Blue Light Cystoscopy System


Northport VA Medical Center, Northport NY (632)
Urology Department

1.   Introduction and Overview

The Northport VAMC Urology department performs several bladder examinations each week and will use white light cystoscopy to visually inspect the bladder during the procedure. 

1.1  Background

Currently, we use standard white light cystoscopy to see the bladder with the hope of detecting cancer during examination. The Blue light fluoroscopy system illuminates the bladder with a blue image after a patient swallows a dye. This increases the likelihood of detecting tumors easier for patients who have been repeatedly diagnosed with cancer of the bladder.

1.2    Scope of Work

Our scope is to acquire one Storz Blue Light Cystoscopy System.

  Objectives

The primary objective is to purchase one Storz Blue Light Cystoscopy System. Fluorescence cystoscopy, although not yet widely used in the United States, has been shown to be effective for detecting tumors in the bladder that might not be visible with standard cystoscopy. The Cystoscopy tower includes a 70  telescope, fluid light cable, blue light camera head, blue light camera processor, D-light light source, 26  LED HD monitor, screen protector, Aida digital recorder, video printer and cart. The equipment has a digital recorder to record digital and still images. If the surgeon decides to take photos of the bladder, they are printed, scanned by the secretary and uploaded in the patients chart.

STATEMENT OF WORK
REMOVABLE DENTAL LABORATORY SERVICES CONTRACT
JJP-VAMC DENTAL SERVICE

1.  Introduction and Scope of Work                                           
The James Peters VA Medical Center (JJP-VAMC) Dental Program requires services for fabrication and repair of Removable Dental Patient Appliances. The JJP-VAMC   maintains an on-site dental laboratory but is unable to fully meet our removable laboratory needs given current staffing and scope of work.  The Contractor shall provide all resources necessary to perform services for fabrications and repairs of removable dental patient appliances, which the JJP-VAMC Dental Program directs to be performed via the contract, delivering in a manner specified by the Schedule for Deliverables.
Our JJP-VAMC Dental Services include the main Dental Clinic plus the Homeless Dental Program and the Community Living Center.  They all utilize the services of private dental laboratories which can t be fully accomplished at our local facility.  These services comprise various removable procedures, each one of them billed separately or as part of a larger set of procedures. The factors that are critical to the dentists are quality and timeliness.  Quality may be obvious but is difficult to quantify since each procedure is so personal and dependent on not only the Laboratory, but on what the dentist submits to that laboratory, which in many instances is patient dependent. Timeliness is critical but may differ for each of the procedures, also dependent upon what the dentist provides to the laboratory and whether that step is independent of all the procedures for that patient or part of a larger restoration.
2.  General Requirements for Removable Laboratory Services:
The Laboratory agrees, in accordance with the terms and conditions stated herein, to furnish the JJP-VAMC with the services specified and at the prices specified in this contract.  Contractor services include but are not limited to the listed procedures.
Procedures for Sending work to the Laboratory: All restorations will be prepared and packaged at the medical center.  In the package will be the required casts and other materials necessary to complete the work.  A Work Authorization Form will accompany each restoration which describes what needs to be accomplished at that step.
Timeliness Requirements: Every procedure must have an agreed upon turnaround time.  We depend on these dates since patients are appointed based on these commitments.  For example, the processing of a Complete Denture shall take no longer than 3 days in the Laboratory with time for shipping in both directions.  Each of the above mentioned services has a time associated with it - along with each step that is part of the entire procedure should they be done individually. Services to be performed will occur within normal business hours on weekdays.  The Laboratory will provide the delivery service which picks up and delivers at least 1 time per day   Monday thru Friday. They should also have a service available to pick up if needed on an emergency basis. If it is necessary to use mail delivery vs. direct pick-up, an overnight service must be designated. (See Attachment #1: Service Turn-around Time, for details).

The individual technicians must be deemed competent in their respective field of expertise by the head of the Laboratory.
Reporting and Documentation Requirements: The  Laboratory shall establish and maintain a log of patients treated under this contract including the patient s name and last four numbers of their SSN, fees charged for each order , date received and date delivered. This log (or detailed invoice) will be submitted to the VA on a monthly basis.  
Reimbursement Method: The restorations shall be performed as a fee for service, under the direction of the Medical Director of the Contractor.
Billing / Payments: Payment will be made on a fee for service basis, per procedure.  Some products require multiple procedure steps. Procedures must be documented and must be performed within the timeframes established by this contract.  Reimbursement will not be provided for any procedures that do not meet quality standards.   Invoices must include the VA purchase order number to ensure timely payment. The Laboratory cannot make any third-party claim to the patient or any other insurance company.
Workload Data: Although it is not guaranteed, it is anticipated that approximately 5-10 cases will be sent to the Lab(s) each day.
Penalty for Non-Performance   if any of the services do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may require the laboratory to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no additional cost to the Government.  Such cases will be discussed between the Chief of the Dental Service or designee and the Laboratory to ensure that expectations in the re-performance are clear and realistic.  When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may: 
Require the Laboratory to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and
Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.

GENERAL 

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. 
1. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS 

a.  A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 
b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 
c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.


2. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE 

a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 
c. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 
d. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 

e. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated. 
f. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
g. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

TRAINING 

All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems: 

 Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems; 
Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training; 
 Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and 
 Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document   e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.] 
 The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. 

 Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete 

The C&A requirements do not apply, and that a Security Accreditation Package is not required.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES 

Purpose. BLM streams within the Lobster Creek and West Fork Smith River (WFSR) basins are habitat for Oregon Coast Coho Salmon, which are listed as federally threatened. Oregon Coast (OC) winter steelhead use both systems and is a Bureau Special Status Sensitive Species (BSSS). Acts of Congress, recovery plans, regulation, and land management plans provide direction for the monitoring of ESA and BSSS species and habitat necessary to support the species. The monitoring of OC Coho and OC Steelhead production is necessary to better inform management decisions.

Lobster Creek and the WFSR life cycle monitoring (LCM) sites are long-term population monitoring locations within the Northwest Oregon and Coos Bay Districts. Long-term monitoring is necessary to establish baseline conditions for production within the basins. The Lobster Creek study area includes paired watersheds for monitoring of differential restoration treatments and long-term management trends on production. In addition, the Lobster Creek monitoring is part of region wide datasets used for population trends for OC Coho Salmon, both for assessing ESA status and for establishing protective harvest regulations.

The West Fork Smith River LCM project will help to monitor the effectiveness of a large scale, basin-wide in-stream restoration project that was implemented in BLM streams within the West Fork Smith River Basin. This will inform restoration work in other sub watersheds within the Coos Bay District, if not the larger Western Oregon area.
The Government contemplates award of one (1) firm fixed-price services contract for fish monitoring services. 
Scope or mission.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supplies, vehicles, computers, software, and supervision necessary to safely run the adult and juvenile LCM sites on the WFSR and Lobster Creek.  
Period of Performance. Performance shall be for a base period and four one-year option periods.

Performance objectives. 
- Weekly estimate of juvenile out-migrants for Coho Salmon smolts and fry, and, when possible, for Chinook Salmon fry, and Cutthroat Trout at the Lobster Creek and WFSR juvenile traps. When out-migrant estimates are not available trap catch numbers will be provided.
- Estimate of total spawner returns for Coho Salmon and winter steelhead at the WFSR adult trap for spawning run year.

Deliverables.
- Monthly reports summarizing the number of days the West Fork Smith River adult trap functioned, the number of hatchery and wild fish that were trapped categorized by species (Chinook and Coho Salmon, steelhead trout), sex and mortalities. 
- Monthly reports summarizing the number of days the West Fork Smith River and Lobster Creek juvenile traps functioned and the estimated out-migrants by age or size categories for Coho Salmon smolts and fry, and steelhead smolts calculated trap efficiencies and handling mortalities. Trap catch or estimated out-migrants, if possible, for Chinook Salmon fry trout fry, steelhead trout, and Cutthroat Trout.
- Annual reports for West Fork Smith River and Lobster Creek juvenile traps which shall include:
o Estimate of out-migrants or trap catch, trap efficiencies, and handling mortalities for Coho Salmon smolts and fry, Chinook Salmon fry, trout fry, steelhead trout, and Cutthroat Trout.
o Estimate of number of Coho smolt and fry migrants, week of peak migration for smolts, mean fork length of smolts during week of peak migration.
o Estimate of number of juvenile winter steelhead smolts, week of peak migration, mean fork length during week of peak migration, and trap catch of parr migrants at the West Fork Smith River.
o Number of Pacific and Brook Lamprey, Speckled Dace, Umpqua Dace, Red Side Shiner, Large Scale Sucker, and Pike Minnow captured.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) / Sources Sought Notice is issued as a means of conducting market research, to determine if other companies, besides BAE Systems Controls Inc. (BAE), are capable of providing performance-based logistics (PBL) support to expand the current sole source joint opportunity contract (JOC), SPE4AX-15-D-9414, to a Supplier Capabilities Contract consisting of performance based supply chain management and logistics support to include, but not limited to, sole source contract actions for sustainment activities, wholesale supply planning and support, depot-level consumable support, material management, data collection, engineering support and sustainment elements, packaging, storage, transportation, repair of BAE parts or systems, reliability improvements, field engineering support, sustainment program management, sustaining logistics, replenishment spares purchases, continuous improvement and technical support arenas. This initiative is being undertaken to maximize the effectiveness of the contract and further expand the breadth of support provided by BAE in aid of DLA goals and initiatives. <br /><br /><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFOMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLTY VOLUNTARY.<br />&nbsp;
<p>Currently under this contract, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Aviation acquires sole source consumable parts and depot-level reparables (DLR) for aircraft and systems manufactured by BAE supporting worldwide DLA direct (DD) shipments under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 only. The JOC is a fixed price requirements type contract (RTC) with prospective price redetermination and was awarded March 23, 2015 with a 5-year base and one 5-year option period; final expiration including option is March 22, 2025. The contract is currently within the third year of the base period. Price redetermination will take place at the option, if exercised, or as pricing expires.</p>
<p>The expanded scope of the contract will include a Captains of Industry (COI) Supplier Capabilities Contract (SCC) and PBL support for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302. The COI / SCC concepts incorporate performance based supply chain management and logistics support in order to maximize the effectiveness of the contract and further expand the breadth of support provided by BAE in aid of DLA's objective to seek holistic logistics solutions. PBL support will enable the DoD to buy a level of support from BAE to support any one of its sole source end-items. A level of support is being used as a general term because it can vary depending on each requirement. Projects will be measured by establishing a price per landing or a price per flight hour and any other pertinent, measurable outcome. Performance-based sustainment and engineering efforts to support service-life extension programs and other modernization upgrades or safety modifications will fit into this categorization of the overall program.</p>
<p>This initiative will involve identifying demand patterns and emergent needs for parts in various federal supply classes (FSC) which are only manufactured by BAE, and to place those items on contract through one of the three identified methods (Standard Consumable and DLR Spare Parts Support, COI / SCC or PBL Support) as demand warrants. As the program matures, and projects relating to the COI / SCC and PBL increments are more clearly identified, market research will be performed to ensure these subsequent phases are sole source to BAE. Market research techniques will include, but are not limited to, industry feedback, synopses, Requests for information (RFI), technical reviews and information obtained from the applicable Services regarding drawings and technical data rights.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the synopsis response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>PURPOSE: DLA desires to transform the current JOC into a Captains of Industry (COI) Supplier Capabilities Contract (SCC) with the base contract continuing consumable and depot-level reparable (DLR) spare parts support under contract number SPE4AX-15-D-9414. Any COI / SCC and PBL support projects identified will have their own unique subsumable contract and contract number reflecting negotiated pricing and any unique requirements that were not previously agreed upon.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is intended to determine if any other entities are capable of supporting the proposed requirements.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: The overall objective of this effort is to achieve a predetermined level of support to include COI / SCC and PBL activities as identified. The potential provider's approach must seek to deliver an integrated performance package designed to optimize system readiness and reduce the total cost of ownership. Additional objectives of this initiative are as follows.</p>
<p>1. Responsibility to reach and maintain a predetermined level of serviceable asset availability of identified parts and related components outlined by DLA through a collaborative partnership arrangement.</p>
<p>2. Reduce the total cost of ownership versus DLA's current supply support model through innovation such as process improvement initiatives, reliability improvement initiatives, lean supply chain initiatives and other techniques</p>
<p>3. Supply engineering and technical support to complement DLA and Military Service cognizant engineering</p>
<p>4. Supplement organic depot maintenance manpower with contractor facilities and personnel, and perform overhaul of the assets to a degree that meets the requirement for end item supply availability, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Work of a highly specialized and technical nature requiring tacit knowledge of a unique end-item with no known commercial variant or like item<br />&bull; Currently, BAE is the only known source capable of satisfying this requirement because it is the sole source qualified<br />&bull; Utilize depot organic maintenance facilities as needed<br />&bull; Meet all source approval requirements</p>
<p>5. Reduce unserviceable supply chain asset generations through holistic approaches that incorporate innovative processes and product improvements. Requires implicit knowledge of field level supply chain processes and procedures, and its correlation and interaction with depot level supply chain</p>
<p>6. Supply piece part product support integration of unique items (determine quantities needed, purchase needed parts, warehouse, issue parts to maintenance and maintain documentation for historical usage purposes)</p>
<p>7. Be DLA's global source of supply for all sole source and unique material required</p>
<p>8. Provide overall planning and support (Program Management), in collaboration with DLA, to determine the quantity of items required to meet designated targets</p>
<p>RESPONSES: DLA requires that only non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice. DLA shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for the use of any proprietary information submitted.</p>
<p>1. Responses are required no later than July 20, 2018.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research purposes.<br />DLA Troop Support, Clothing &amp; Textile Directorate is conducting market research and seeking information from interested parties concerning the availability of domestic "GOAT/KIDSKIN" in the United States for use in the manufacture of various gloves. Currently, the FAR 25.104(a) provides an exception to the Berry Amendment in allowing the use of non-domestic "GOAT/KIDSKIN" for DOD procurements. This market research is intended to help determine the need for this exception as it relates to DLA procurements for the Army Combat Gloves-Capacitive (Type II) IAW Purchase Description GL-PD-08-81D, dated November 08, 2017 with an estimated annual requirement of 210,000 pairs. <br />PGC(s) - Nomenclature<br />03250 - USMC dress glove<br />IAW CR/PD 02-06D SYSCOM, Dated December 30, 2013 with an estimated annual requirement of 47,065 pairs.<br />03304 -ICW glove<br />IAW Purchase Description MIL-DTL-44419A, dated 12 April 2016, with an estimated annual requirement of 43,308 pairs.<br />03127 - Glove Fuel handlers<br />IAW Purchase Description GL/PD-07-06C, dated July 21, 2011 with an estimated annual requirement of 13,104 pairs.<br />10214 - Glove shell electric<br />IAW ASTM F696-06 dated 2011 with an estimated annual requirement of 6,000 pairs.
<p><br />Please answer the following questions:<br />1. Is there sufficient domestic Goat/Kidskins available in the U.S. to satisfy the DLA estimated annual requirements for these gloves?</p>
<p>2. If not, is it possible to get sufficient Goat/Kidskins from non-domestic sources in a pickled state and then "tanned" in the US to satisfy the above requirements?</p>
<p>3. If non-domestic Goat/Kidskins are required, how much processing of those skins should be permitted to be performed by non-domestic sources to meet quality requirements in the referenced (PD/Spec/CID) versus those that can or should be performed in the US on the above list of requirements?</p>
<p>4. Please confirm that domestic tanning capability exist to process hides needed to make the glove requirements specified above and if requirements for any other Goat/Kidskin products have an adverse impact on the domestic tanning capability of the above requirements.</p>
<p>5. Is there a price difference between the pickled form and the blue form of the Goat/Kidskins?</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation for proposals. Your response to this notice will be treated as information only. <br />Please submit your response to Samuel Clifton via email: samuel.clifton@dla.mil by 3:30 PM EDST July 16, 2018.</p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUND:<br /></strong><br />The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for providing federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives.

The GPAO's Service Units include seven hospitals, eight health centers, and several smaller health stations and satellite clinics. Each facility incorporates a comprehensive health care delivery system. The hospitals, health centers, and satellite clinics provide inpatient and outpatient care and conduct preventive and curative clinics.<br /><br /><strong>PURPOSE:</strong><br /><br />The Great Plains Area Indian Health Service (GPAIHS), Aberdeen, South Dakota is issuing this sources sought synopsis in support of Market Research to identify firms for the purpose of providing up to three (3) Midlevel Providers (Nurse Practitioners) to provide uninterrupted medical services during ongoing primary care provider shortages for the Outpatient Department (OPD) located at the Woodrow Wilson Keeble Memorial Health Care Center (WWKMHCC), Sisseton-Wahpeton Service Unit, Sisseton, South Dakota, 100 Lake Traverse Drive, Sisseton, South Dakota. <br /><br />Work shifts will typically be eight (8) hours and will be worked between the hours of 8:00am and 8:00pm Monday through Friday, including holidays; occasionally additional hours may be required. Work shifts on holidays may be up to eleven (11) hours. Work shifts on the weekends will be four (4) hours each day 1:00pm to 5:00pm. When the Contract Midlevel Provider is scheduled to work on a holiday or weekend, additional time may be scheduled off during the work week, depending on staffing. The typical work week will be 40-50 hours per week.<br /><br /><strong>HOW TO RESPOND:<br /></strong><br />The government is seeking firms that are small business, 8(a) participants, and <strong>all</strong> small business concerns for this requirement.

<RESPDATE>071818
<CONTACT>Wendy Paulo, Contracting Officer, Phone 3019753976, Email Wendy.Paulo@nist.gov
<DESC>Sources Sought<br />BACKGROUND<br />On November 12, 2001, Congress enacted Public Law 107-67, Section 630. This legislation permits Federal agencies, at their discretion, to use appropriated funds (including revolving funds available for salaries and expenses) to assist their lower income employees with child care costs. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has chosen to establish a Child Care Subsidy Program to provide financial assistance to NIST employees who meet specific income criteria. <br /><br />Potential vendors are asked to comment as to their ability to meet or exceed the specifications outlined below. Values listed in parenthesis represent currently expected minimum specifications; however, this list may be modified and/or expanded should a formal procurement be pursued. <br /><br />GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<br />1. FedRAMP<br />a. The Federal Risk and Authorization Program (FedRAMP) is a risk management program for large outsourced and multi-agency information systems used by the U.S Government. FedRAMP authorizes and continuously monitors IT services that are used by multiple federal departments and agencies. This approach uses a "do once, use many times" framework that will save cost, time, and staff required to conduct redundant agency security assessments. <br />b. The contractor shall have, at a minimum, an authorized FedRAMP security and privacy controls package at a moderate level, or an authorized Federal Government agency FISMA security and privacy controls package at a moderate level. <br />c. The Prime Contractor must have FedRAMP authorization or an Authorization to Operate (ATO) letter issued by a Federal Government agency as proof of evidence that they have been assessed and authorized at the moderate level. If using an ATO letter, that letter shall clearly state that the Contractor has been authorized at a moderate level. <br />d. If the Contractor is using subcontractors for this effort, each party that will store, process, transmit, or have any type of access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII_ or other sensitive information shall have the above stated FedRAMP authorization or Federal Agency-issued ATO letter stating the authorization at the moderate level. <br />e. Within 5 days of contract award, the Contractor must supply evidence of a FedRAMP authorization or a valid ATO letter as proof. Either form of evidence must show authorization at a moderate level. If any subcontractor or consultant will have access to PII, the same evidence must be submitted for that party as well. <br />2. Website Security Requirements<br />a. The Contractor must maintain a website that is secure for a Federal Agency. For the purpose of this acquisition, secure refers to all of the following:<br />i. Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) - The contractor shall have its services be accessible through both Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) and IPv4. If not already compliant, the Contractor must provide the Government with a statement regarding its plans to implement IPv6, including timeframe. <br />ii. Section 508 - The Contractor shall create and maintain a website with content and links that comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. <br />iii. Vulnerability Checks - Post contract award, the Government will perform on-going security assessments for continuous monitoring and will inform the Contractor of identified risks. The Government will determine the risk rating of identified vulnerabilities. The Contractor must exhort their best effort to respond to the Government with an action plan and schedule to mitigate security risks found within 30 days of notification of security risks. If an action plan is submitted, the Government will notify the Contractor if the action plan and schedule are acceptable. The Contractor must implement the action plan on schedule. This action plan is not a contract deliverable. The Contractor is strongly encouraged to work with NIST should vulnerabilities be identified. <br />3. Confidentiality<br />a. The Contractor shall be responsible to maintain the confidentiality of all personally identifiable information (PII) that is provided. For the purpose of this acquisition, "confidentiality" means ensuring that only those who have a need to know have access to the PII. PII shall not be disclosed to any party that do not have a direct need to know without the prior written approval of the COR and the Contracting Officer. <br />b. The Contractor and all members of the Contractor's team, including consultants and subcontractors, shall adhere to the Privacy Act, Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Section 552a. Reference the Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses 52.224-1 Privacy Act Notification and 52.224-2 Privacy Act. <br /><br />TASKS<br />1. Develop a Website<br />The Contractor shall develop, host and maintain a website for the CCSP that is secure for a federal agency. Minimum requirements for the website:<br />&bull; Application form for NIST employees in accordance with Attachment 2;<br />&bull; Child Care provider form in accordance with Attachment 3;<br />&bull; Be live 24/7;<br />&bull; The website must link to the NIST Website;<br />&bull; Instructions on the application process;<br />&bull; Contractor points of contact;<br />&bull; COR name and contact information;<br />&bull; Information on customer support and how to reach a live representative;<br />&bull; The NIST Child Care Subsidy Program Business Care Analysis;<br />The Contractor shall develop an alpha version of the website and provide this version to the COR for review and comment. <br />2. Develop Letter Templates for Acceptance and Rejection<br />The contractor shall develop letter templates for acceptance, rejection, and the notification of recipient reaching the maximum subsidy with respect to the CCSP for the applicant and the child care provider. <br />3. Provide and Process CCSP Applications<br />The Contractor shall receive and process all CCSP applications. <br />The Contractor shall review all documentation provided by the applicant and make a recommendation to the COR that the applicant is or is not eligible for Federal assistance under the CCSP. <br />Upon receipt of the COR's concurrence, the Contractor shall forward a written response to the applicant and the child care provider, via e-mail or U.S. mail, using the appropriate template provided under Task 3. <br />The Contractor shall maintain an individual record for each applicant which includes all documents, information, applications, invoices, communication records, and any other documents pertinent to their case. <br />4. Customer Support<br />The Contractor must have personnel available to respond to questions from NIST personnel about the program between the hours of 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM Monday through Friday. <br />5. Review of Monthly Invoices<br />The Contractor must have an established invoicing process to receive, review, and pay invoices electronically for the CCSP program.<br />Upon acceptance into the program, the Contractor must notify the provider to submit complete invoices, in arrears, to the Contractor.<br />The Contractor shall review invoices and provide payment, if appropriate, based on the invoiced amount not later than 30 calendar days after the date of receipt of a complete invoice. The Contractor shall pay the child care subsidy tuition assistance directly to the child care provider, and not to the Federal employee.<br />The Contractor shall:<br />- Ensure that the child care provider submits a written invoice, on a monthly basis, to the Contractor;<br />- Child care subsidy shall be submitted as weekly amounts and the invoices must be prepared using full week amounts unless the child leaves the program during a particular week. A full week amount consists of the weekly amount. <br />6. Reapplication<br />The Contractor is not required to have applicants re-apply on an annual basis. The Contractor shall ensure that applicants re-certify no later than May 15th of each year. The Contractor must require that applicants submit their current federal income tax return, leave and earnings (L&amp;E) statement, and a fee schedule from the child care provider.

<p>5.	Description:  <br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background:  Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs for the pharmacological treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI), although some 10 to 42 million people worldwide, including more than 1.7 million Americans, experience a TBI annually [1]. Alarmingly, TBI is surpassing many common diseases as a major cause of death and disability [2] (30.5%). Of further concern, there is an increased mortality in the elderly and a worse functional outcome following lower initial injury severity [3]. In addition to acute effects (cognitive loss, depression, sleep disorders, anxiety, etc.), TBI triggers a pathological cascade that can lead to early dementia onset [4,5] and is one of the most powerful risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders [6].  By far the majority of TBIs are mild to moderate in nature and account for 80-95% of cases, with severe TBI comprising the remainder. With increases in survival rate following initial injury, TBI can result in substantial and lifelong cognitive, physical, and behavioral impairments that require long-term access to health care and disability services [7].</p>
<p>TBI-associated brain damage in generally categorized into two primary phases. First, an initial phase of primary damage occurs at the moment of insult. This includes contusion and laceration, diffuse axonal injury and intracranial hemorrhage, generally causing instantaneous (necrotic) cell death. This is followed by a longer second phase involving biological processes initiated at the time of injury that may continue over a far greater duration - driven by ischemia, neuroinflammation, glutamate toxicity, astrocyte reactivity, axonal shearing and apoptosis [8-11]. Such secondary brain injury may be reversible; depending on the time-dependent biological processes that drive this extended secondary phase and how quickly and effectively these can be mitigated.</p>
<p>Preclinical studies of the NIA experimental drug phenserine tartrate (PhenT) as well Pomalidomide (Pom) analogs can mitigate mild TBI in a well characterized mouse model [12,13]. These agents appear to have a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities of potential value for the treatment of mTBI as well as long term neurodegenerative disorders [14]. These include lowering the synthesis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and alpha-synuclein (&alpha;-syn), proteins of consequence in the pathology of AD and Parkinson's disease, respectively. In addition, PhenT possesses anti-inflammatory properties [13], also a phenomenon of significance in TBI [15], as well as an array of trophic and, importantly, anti-apoptotic actions [12,16].</p>
<p><br />The focus of this SOW is to critically evaluate these agents in a well characterized mouse model of moderate TBI. This is important as no single animal model is predictive of activity in humans, and hence the demonstration of efficacy across animal TBI models in important (17)</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:<br /> Preclinical studies in mice to evaluate two experimental drugs for efficacy in a controlled cortical impact model of moderate traumatic brain injury. The objective of this contract is to assess whether or not either of the two experimental drugs warrants evaluation as a new treatment strategy for moderate traumatic brain injury - for which there is no current pharmacological treatment.</p>
<p>Project requirements: <br />Histochemical, behavioral and biochemical analysis of TBI mice after treatment with phenserine tartrate and a Pomalidomide analog.</p>
<p>Six groups of mice, 30 animals per group (15 males and 15 females), will be exposed to telencephalic CCI or sham injury followed by administration within 5 h after injury of either (1) vehicle, (2) phenserine tartrate, or (3) a Pomalidomide analog. Each group of 30 will be subdivided into two groups for assessment of behavior and biochemical changes in 18 and 12 animals, respectively. The phenserine dose administered will be 2.5 mg/k BID x 5 days after injury and the Pomalidomide analog dose will be 28 mg/kg once daily x 5 days. Both of these experimental drugs will be provided by Dr. Nigel H. Greig, NIA, NIH, at no cost to the contract. Since hypothermia is neuroprotective, monitoring and regulating body temperature during and after CCI surgery and drug administration will be undertaken to obviate this potential caveat. Although CCI produces a relatively stable and reproducible injury, righting reflex time will be measured postoperatively after CCI to further document comparability between the various treatment groups.</p>
<p>Behavior Assay (18 animals per group): Animals will undergo motor testing and behavioral testing as detailed below at baseline. After CCI or sham injury, animals will undergo motor and behavioral testing again at 24 h after injury (9 animals) or at 7 days after injury (9 animals), followed by histological analysis using cresyl violet and fluoroJade C (FJC) staining.</p>
<p>Motor Behavior: Evaluations will consist of a modified neurological severity score (mNSS) assessment, a tactile adhesive removal test, an elevated body swing test and a beam walk test. All will be performed by an observer blinded to the experimental groups. Overall motor activity will be measured in automated chambers. To compare neurological deficit severity in TBI mice, a mNSS (a composite of motor, sensory, reflex and balance tests) will be performed. One point is scored for inability to perform the test or for the lack of a tested reflex; thus, the higher the score, the more severe the injury. Neurological function is graded on a scale of 0-18 (normal score, 0; maximal deficit score, 18). A tactile removal test will be used to evaluate somatosensory function. In this test, two small adhesive-backed stickers are used as bilateral tactile stimuli that are placed on the distal-radial region on the wrist of each forelimb. Mice will be pre-trained daily for 3 days before CCI. The time required (not to exceed 180 s) for the mouse to remove the sticker from the forelimb will be recorded.</p>
<p>Cognitive Behavior: The Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Y-Maze paradigms will be used. The NOR paradigm will evaluate recognition memory in mice. This task is based on the innate tendency of rodents to explore new objects within their environment. A discrimination preference index is calculated as follows: (time spent near the new object minus time spent near the old object) / (time spent near the new object plus time spent near the old object). After each session, the objects and arenas will be thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol to prevent odor recognition.  The Y maze paradigm will assess rodent spatial memory based upon observing the preference of the animal for a &lsquo;new' location over a &lsquo;familiar' location on two separate occasions. The time each mouse spends within the arms is recorded and used to generate a preference index, as initially described by Dix and Aggleton. Likewise, the maze will be cleaned using a 70% ethanol solution and dried in order to prevent any olfactory recognition between trials.</p>
<p>Histology evaluation Cresyl violet and FJC staining will be used to assess contusion volume and neuronal degeneration, respectively.  FJC (Biosensis, TR-100-FJ) binds selectively to degenerating neuronal cells. All sections will be observed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope with a blue (450-490 nm) excitation light with blinded observers and unbiased stereology (Microbright).  Cresyl violet will be used to measure contusion volume, by staining sections followed by digitization and analysis using a 1&times; objective and computer image analysis system. Contusion area will be calculated from all images of cresyl violet-stained sections that contain contused brain. Hemisphere tissue loss will be expressed as a percent calculated by [(contralateral minus ipsilateral hemispheric volumes) / contralateral hemispheric volume) &times; 100%].</p>
<p>Biochemistry and Immunocytochemistry Assay (12 animals per group): Animals will be euthanized 8 h after injury for biochemical and immunofluorescence markers. Both the injured and non-injured sides will be used for these studies in both CCI and sham animals.</p>
<p>Immunocytochemistry: Sections will be incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies, either mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody (Millpore; 1:500, NeuN is a neuronal marker)/ anti-p53 antibody (GeneTex; 1:500) / anti-annexin V antibody (Abcam ; 1:500) / anti-p-p53 antibody (Cell signaling; 1:1000) / or anti-PUMA antibody (Abcam; 1:200) at 4&deg;C overnight and with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor&reg; 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA); Alexa Fluor&reg; 594 anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA)). The numbers of NeuN-, p53-, annexin V-, p-p53-, and PUMA-positive cells are counted in 5 randomly selected fields by means of SPOT image analysis software using blinded observers and unbiased stereology (MBF biosystem).<br />Statistical Analysis</p>
<p>Evaluation of data will use T-tests for simple two group comparisons, ANOVA for multiple group comparisons with Tukey post-hoc analysis, and appropriate tests for nonparametric data as needed. The Bonferroni correction will be used for serial comparisons over time. In cases where the time course of changes is important, as in the current proposal, nonlinear regression analysis will be applied. For a two-sided test of a null hypothesis of equality in mean values with Type I error of 0.05, power = 0.85 for an effect size of 1.35 (estimated based on results of our previous studies), this study will require a minimum of 17 animals per group to detect the targeted outcome, so the proposed sample size should be sufficient. Numbers for all experiments will be subject to modification as more data on variance is obtained.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Peerless-Winsmith, Inc. to repair eight (8) Planetary Gearbox Differential Speed Reducers PN #14636-5003-3, Winsmith Model #D651229-8X0WS, ASN #R400-2A1A3A3A1, for the National Reconditioning Center (NRC) in Grandview, MO.
<p>Justification for Sole Source<br />The National Weather Service (NWS) NEXRAD Doppler Meteorological Radars provide the capability to detect severe weather and give weather observers and forecasters the ability to issue early warnings to the general public and aviation users.  The Planetary Gearbox is a critical part of the NEXRAD Radar.  It is used to move the antenna dish in the horizontal and vertical direction while supporting the full weight of the antenna.  Failure of this equipment would prevent movement of the antenna and eliminate the radar's ability to detect severe weather, in turn, failing to allow NWS to support their mission of protecting life and property by providing weather alerts and warnings.</p>
<p>Peerless-Winsmith, Inc. is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the NEXRAD Planetary Gearbox.  The gearboxes were designed and manufactured to meet strict NEXRAD specifications and the OEM owns the proprietary rights to all drawings developed for the equipment.  Peerless-Winsmith, Inc. is the only known source of repair, certification, and warranty of this equipment.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) Innovation Centre, 2300 McKenzie Ave, Victoria, BC Canda, for Oceans 2.0 hardware, software, and support for the Office of Ocean Exploration and Research in Seattle, WA. <br />
<p>Background<br />The NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer is uniquely equipped with a high bandwidth satellite connection and a suite of collaboration tool referred to as telepresence technology . NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration and Research (OER) leverages this technology to capitalize on  a worldwide team of volunteer researchers operating on shore while the ship is at sea to provide a multidisciplinary team to explore the deep ocean.</p>
<p>This state of the art software and hard ware will allow the data collection team  aboard NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer  to interact with massive video datasets composed of numerous data types and provide a real time and post cruise annotation and is the only solution on the market worldwinde that can provide thee serves and be ready for field deployment on board the Okeanos Explorer.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification<br />ONC is a not-for profit organization, established by the University of Victoria to manage and enhance the VENUS and NEPTUNE observatories. VENUS and NEPTUNE represent over $200M in capital investment, and support transformative, multidisciplinary research in coastal and deep ocean environments whose applications shed light on ocean processes and their impacts on a global scale. Since its inception, ONC has also expanded to include observatories in the Arctic Ocean, expanded systems along the west coast of Canada, community volunteer ship data collection systems, coastal radars, ferry-based observations, and autonomous systems.</p>
<p>A key aspect of ONC that stands out from other systems operating is the sophisticated interface for users (Oceans 2.0), including the ability to interact with specific instruments, download data in a variety of formats, explore visual and acoustic data sets, and create a variety of plots and images. Oceans 2.0 features data and information for the public, scientists and educators. Users access ONC using the Oceans 2.0 data management and archive system over the Internet using a web portal, web services, or pre-programmed retrievals. The three main components of Oceans 2.0 include (i) Seascribe - a web based real-time annotation system, (ii) SeaTube - a web based video delivery, post cruise annotation system and (iii) Several plotting and visualizations tools to plot oceanographic data collected during ROV expeditions. Although built originally for observatories, the use of these tools have been successfully expanded to ship based operations. Being web-based, these tools are especially useful for telepresence enabled expeditions, similar to NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer, where most of data users (public and scientists) are based on shore.</p>
<p>Oceans 2.0 provides the capability for the 24/7 acquisition of high volumes of extremely diverse data, data quality control and calibration, storage, visualization and access by a global audience, as well as providing a convenient interface to handle otherwise complex tasks associated with the remote monitoring and control of the ROV operations. Oceans 2.0 is able to manage the vast amount of data produced, and users can mine the live and archived data streams, to detect trends, classify content and extract features, feeding the results back into the master database, thereby turning raw data into usable information and setting the stage to allow the information to be transformed into knowledge. For more detailed information related to ONC, please see the supplemental document Oceans 2.0 - An Introduction.<br />http://www.oceannetworks.ca/sites/default/files/images/u2564/Oceans%202.0%20-%20An<br />%20Introduction.pdf</p>
<p>There are no alternative sources for this software. This software is proprietary to ONC and no other software can perform the specialized functions extensively tailored to video data analysis that are configured for distributed web based access and hardened for at sea operations. No other company can make modifications to the software or offer subscription services for this proprietary software package.</p>
<p>This contract would extend and improve upon services ONC provided as part of a project that expires in September, 2018.  In 2016-2017 numerous science and engineering experts were consulted to identify potential solutions for NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer video annotation systems. Although single user video annotations tools are available (e.g. a scientist doing annotations on a ship) but these tools are not adaptable for real-time annotation online from multiple users spread across the globe. Oceans 2.0 provides unique capabilities for real-time ship and shore based annotations of video streams, post cruise annotations by multiple users, and ability to combine various data sources together.</p>
<p>ONC does not have any resellers. ONC is the sole provider of this software and thus there is only one source.</p>
<p>Underwater ROV operations are expensive (over $50,000 a day). The video data collected is only useful as much as the details of the annotations that are available with the video data. As it is logistically impossible to sail with experts from all the various fields of marine science, NOAA OER has invested heavily in telepresence technology. The high bandwidth satellite based connection (&gt; $100,000 per month) enables video from ROV to stream live in real time. The scientists from all over the world tune in to observe the video. This provides an enormous opportunity to leverage interest and expertise of these scientists to annotate video. However, to achieve this objective, a web based annotation tool is required. The video data and ancillary oceanographic data are massive in size (350 GB/day) and complex to analyze. ONC Oceans 2.0 offers a solution of real time annotation (SeaScribe) which can be effortlessly extended for post cruise data analysis and annotation (using SeaTube and associated data plotting and analysis tools). Currently, NOAA does not have robust video annotation and database tools that supports onboard and onshore logging as well the post cruise video annotations therefore the government is failing to record valuable datasets.</p>
<p>The Office of Ocean Exploration and Research has spent over a hundred thousand dollars over the last two and a half years to upgrade the video recording systems onboard the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer. Without the robust integrated logging and annotation system offered by Ocean 2.0 the data quality and discoverability of their new data set will be greatly reduced. There are no other software suites tailored for use on board a ship that are designed to be used with a telepresence enabled distributed science team. Creating a new custom system for OER's operations would cost more than a quarter-half million dollars and take years to develop.  Utilizing Oceans 2.0 will provide significant cost saving for the government both in direct saving from the government not having to contract the development of a custom software package. It will also greatly increase the quality of the data NOAA collects and will benefit NOAA and the marine science community in ways that are impossible to quantify.</p>
<p><br />Sources Sought<br />This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available.

The MRO line will be located in the contractorâ€™s facilities. Status of Forces Agreements between the United States and the contractorâ€™s host nation, as well as flight distance limitations, will be factors in the solicitation process. 

The specifics of any flight distance limitations have not yet been fully determined.
 Interested potential offerors are encouraged to attend the Industry Day meeting regardless of their flight distance from the locations of the aircraft.

Contractor MRO support will include the following: 

1) Depot Level Maintenance

Depot level maintenance (also known as Heavy Maintenance) tasks/actions are those requiring major overhaul or complete rebuilding, remanufacturing, or modification of aircraft structures, parts, assemblies, and end items, including support equipment in accordance with the Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP) IMP Specification and other applicable maintenance manuals.
 
2) Planned Maintenance Interval (PMI) work under IMP

IMP requirements provide for airframe, systems and component inspection (through visual and Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) methods), defect correction, preventative maintenance, operational checkouts and Technical Directive compliance.

The IMP requirements for aircraft subject to this process are the minimum requirements, formulated and established to the depth required to ensure the reliability, operational availability, safe operation and airworthiness of the aircraft for the duration of the established service period.
The IMP Program will provide depot support throughout the total service life of the aircraft.

a. PMI events for H-53 will be based on the latest NAVAIR Specification.

b. The estimated Aircraft throughput is 8 aircraft per year. However, the contract type will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) and will not guarantee either the quantity or frequency of aircraft inductions.  

c. It is anticipated that the Contractor shall be capable of supporting a nominal workload of 5 aircraft in flow, with a surge capacity to 7 aircraft in flow.

d. This requirement includes CH-53 Reset in accordance with NAVAIR A1-H53CE-MRC-300. The Reset inspection is an operational and material condition inspection conducted on CH-53E aircraft.
The Contractor will perform all organizational and intermediate level repairs identified under Reset, as well as any required aircraft modifications. Resets will be performed concurrent with PMI and as stand-alone events.   

e. Aircraft inducted for PMI will be flown to the contractorâ€™s facility.

3) In-Service Repairs (ISR)

Unscheduled maintenance requirements are those requirements, (typically identified as Depot Level Maintenance), which cannot be directly related to any scheduled requirement described herein and which are discovered as an incidental result of the following functions accomplished as a part of and during the scheduled inspection, and during squadron operational use.

a.
ISR repairs are expected to be completed either concurrently with PMI events or as standalone actions.

b. ISR repairs may require the Contractor to dispatch personnel as a contractor field service team (CFT) to perform aircraft ISR throughout the western Pacific region, and other areas as required, without impacting PMI event turn-around times (TAT).

4) Aircraft Modifications 
a. Aircraft modifications (e.g. technical directives, airframe changes, etc.) shall be accomplished either concurrently with PMI events, as standalone actions and as part of CH-53E Reset.

b. The Government will provide the technical data and material required for completing modifications.

5) Customer Service

a.
Customer Service requirements include Squadron Operational Level maintenance tasks performed concurrent with PMI activities when approved by the Government.

6) Engineering Support

a. Engineering services, necessary to support the requirements of the contract, including submittal of repair procedures to be reviewed and approved by the Government.

7) Logistics Support

a. Logistics services necessary to support the requirements of the contract, including timely supply data and material requisition requests necessary for completing aircraft maintenance requirements within the established TAT. The government will procure or directly fund procurement of all material.

8) Program Management Support

a.
Program Management necessary to support the requirements of the contract, including annual Program Management Reviews (PMR), weekly production meetings, Production Plans that identify the critical path to PMI completion within the established TAT.

FRCWP is considering an Industry Day in support of this requirement to be held at Naval Air Facility Atsugi from 15 to 16 August 2018. Attendance is anticipated to be limited to only five representatives per firm. If the government decides to host an industry day, a separate announcement will be made in the future with additional information.

9) Anticipated Facility and Airfield Requirements

â€¢	Access to an airfield capable of providing take off and landings of H-53 aircraft.
Airfield requirements for landing C-5/C-17/AN-124 or equivalent size large transport aircraft. Proof of airfield availability will be required in the contract solicitation.
â€¢	Apron space (outside) for parking up to five (5) H-53â€™s.
â€¢	Repair hangar or hangars capable of supporting seven (7) each H-53 aircraft.
â€¢	Hangars and other maintenance spaces shall meet all applicable environmental and safety requirements (including fire suppression).
â€¢	Contractor provides all support equipment (not otherwise provided as government furnished equipment) and common aircraft maintenance tools. 
â€¢	Paint stripping, priming and painting capability.
â€¢	Capability for fabricating aircraft parts that are not available through the Navy Supply System.


Interested companies are asked to submit any questions or comments related to the requirements described above as well as provide information on the following:

(1) Company name, point of contact, telephone numbers, e-mail address, company CAGE Code, and DUNS

(2) Approximate annual gross revenue for the past 5 years (if available).

(3) Description of the companyâ€™s ability to mobilize, manage and finance a contract of this size.

(4) Description of Government or commercial contracts for work on identical T/M/S aircraft (both as prime and sub-contractor)*

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 
b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 
c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. 
d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. 
e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination. 

3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE 
a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 
b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. 
c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. 
d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 
e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 
h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated. 
i. The contractor/subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request. 
j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response. 
k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response. 
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR. 





6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION 

a. The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 
d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement.

The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. 

7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 
b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 

(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); 

(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any; 
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals; 
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and 
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 

d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $ _______ per affected  individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: 

(1) Notification; 
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports; 
(3) Data breach analysis; 
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; 
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and 
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs. 

8. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS and is for informational/market research purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS, NOR A SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION UNDER FAR SUBPART 5.2. The proposed project is anticipated to be a competed, firm-fixed price contract. The type of solicitation to be issued will depend upon information received in response to this sources sought announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this sources sought announcement or any follow up information. Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.<br />This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Corps. The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potentially qualified Small Businesses (SB), 8(a), Small Disadvantage Business (SDB), Woman Owned Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or HUBZone prime contractor business sources and their size classifications relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Construction; small business size standard is $36.5 Million. The Federal Service Code (FSC) is Y1KF. Depending upon the responses in the small business categories listed above, the solicitation will either be set aside in one of the latter categories or be issued as unrestricted open to both small and large business.</p>
<p>Limitations on Subcontracting: The prime contractor, in accordance with FAR clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting paragraph (c)(4) Construction by special trade contractors, will perform at least 25 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District, requires the replacement of the Hiram M. Chittenden Lock's large lock Stoney Gate Valve System. The magnitude of construction is $10 Million to $25 Million. The start date is to be determined. The work consists of:</p>
<p>&bull; Gate Valve Replacement: The Stoney gate valve system consists of six gate valves that control the filling and emptying of the Lake Washington Ship Canal large lock chambers. The valves are located in 14 feet tall by 8-1/2 feet wide culverts. The culverts and associated valves are accessible only when the large lock chambers are dewatered by the Government. The scope encompasses demolition, removal, and replacement of the existing Stoney gate valves, valve guides, valve bases, machinery and incidentals related to work. This work is to be spread over three separate dewatering events.<br />&bull; Control Panel Replacement: The existing control panel is a partially programmable logic controller (PLC) based with additional hardwired controls and indicators. The PLC system primarily handles miter gate operation, and is vulnerable to disruption in the system (i.e. lightning strikes). The scope encompasses demolition, removal, and replacement of the Chittenden control panel, extension of fiber optic cabling, and incidentals related to work. The new system will utilize a master PLC and six Remote I/O Panels (RIOPS) each located in a miter gate machinery recess. RIOPS will provide localized control of the associated Stoney gate valve, and will additionally provide localized control of miter gate operations. The master/RIOP system will utilize a fiber optic ring network. Existing fiber optic cables will be incorporated into the new system and augmented with additional fiber optic cabling.</p>
<p>Industry Day / Site Visit:<br />The Government will have an Industry Day / Site Visit on 14 November 2017 at 9:00am in the Chittenden Locks Visitor Center Theater. Once the briefing is completed a tour of the Stoney gate valve system will be offered to all in attendance, gloves, a hard hat and waterproof boots are required. <br />Site Visit Registration:</p>
<p>All personnel wishing to attend the Industry Day / Site Visit please contact Brian Nelson no later than 13 November 2014 at 1:00 pm (Pacific) via email, Brian.C.Nelson@usace.army.mil. Requests for attendance received after 1:00 PM the day prior to the site visit date will not be accepted. Due to limited field staff available for site visits, only one site visit will be offered. Individual requests for site visits will not be granted. Offerors should visit the site and take such other steps as may be reasonably necessary to ascertain the nature and location of the work, and the general and local conditions which can affect the work or the cost thereof. Failure to do so shall not relieve Offerors from responsibility for estimating properly the difficulty or cost of successfully performing the work. The Government shall assume no responsibility for any understanding or representations concerning conditions made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of the contract, unless included in the solicitation, specifications/plans, or related documents.</p>
<p>Each individual must have valid government picture identification on his/her person while at the project site. There can be no substitutions of one individual for another. If an individual arrives at the site visit without having RSVP'd ahead of time and/or without picture identification, that individual may not be allowed on the project.</p>

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION   SOURCES SOUGHT 
 NAME BRAND REQUEST - GH3+ Guldmann Patient Lift System


Contracting Office Address: 
Department of Veterans Affairs 
Program Contracting Activity Central 
6150 Oak Tree Blvd, Suite 300 
Independence, OH 44131

The Department of Veterans Affairs Long Beach (VALB) Healthcare System requires a quantity of four (4) GH3+ Guldmann Ceiling Lift System for the Tibor Rubin VA Medical Center located at 5901 E. Seventh Street, Long Beach, CA 90822. The items shall be delivered to a warehouse located at 1964 W. Corporate Way, Anaheim, CA.  The GH3+ Ceiling lift is a stationary lifting motor that is powerful enough to handle lifting and moving procedures in almost all professional care settings. The ceiling lift is easy to operate and helps make lifting and moving procedures safe, simple and comfortable for users and care staff. It is designed with a lifting capacity of up to 375 kg/825lbs on a single strap and is ideal for use in bariatric care. The GH3+ ceiling lift can be fitted with one or more modules from the Guldmann Care Lift Management (CLM) system, which streamlines everyday use of the ceiling hoist system and increases efficiency. These CLM modules can be used for monitoring and improving procedures for safe patient handling, and for optimizing resource planning. 

The purchase and installation of 4 Guldmann Ceiling Lift systems in Project 402 of VA Long Beach (VALB) Healthcare System is essential in the standardization of the whole facility. At present, 90% of VALB s ceiling lifts are Guldmann, while 10% are Hill-Rom Liko. As the Hill-Rom Liko ceiling lifts reaches the end of their life cycle, the ceiling lifts are replaced with Guldmann to ultimately reach 100% Guldmann only ceiling lifts in the entire facility. The Guldmann ceiling lifts are compatible with all slings used facility wide. The introduction of a third ceiling lift system at VALB is counterproductive to the standardization plan of VALB and the Safe Patient Handling and Mobility s VHA Directive 2010-032 (Safe Patient Handling and Mobility Program). This directive also specifies that new construction and renovation projects will incorporate patient handling and mobility technology appropriate to the type of care setting in the design phase. A standardized process of equipment use and sling mounting will increase safe patient movement.  

The likelihood of staff returning to manual means of patient movement increases with lack of familiarization of multiple movement systems. The use of identical equipment throughout he facility decreases the possibility of human error and enhances patient safety. The GH3+ is characterized by its simple design and developed for versatile application and different work processes. It can be used to assist care staff with additional care tasks like mobilization exercises, training and rehabilitation programs. The GH3+ also include features such as automatically recharging batteries and movement along a traverse rail, where the lifting module is operated either by a hand control or an infra-red (IR) remote control unit reducing unnecessary movement of patients. The GH3+ technology is intended to facilitate safe repositioning, mobility, and transport for patients and care staff alike.  

At present, the VALB staff are trained with the proper use of Guldmann ceiling lift system with different variations of slings. The VALB Biomed staff are currently certified by Guldmann, Inc. to perform annual inspection, maintenance, and repairs, which decreases overall work stoppage due to major mechanical issues. Guldmann also provides 2-years initial warranty on all hardware and motors (parts and labor) and includes the first 2-years of PMI, which value is estimating around $100,000.

The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract. This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition in accordance with FAR subpart 13.106. 

Please note that this is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the product/services listed above. Deadline date for the submittal is July 20, 2018 at 4PM Eastern Daylight Time. The anticipated award date is September 9, 2018.

Information received will be considered solely for determining method of solicitation. For information regarding this purchase, contact James Carson, Contract Specialist, at (216) 447-8300 or james.carson2@va.gov.

**IMPORTANT:  Please read this notice in full BEFORE responding!**

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is in the process of planning a requirement in which a contractor will be required to provide deliver and install Temperature and Humidity Monitors (Brand Name or EQUAL) as part of the initial outfitting of the newly constructed Chico Outpatient Clinic located at Chico VA Clinic 2000 Concord Avenue Chico, CA 95928. Â (see salient characteristics, delivery specifications, and warranty specifications below).

The VA is conducting market research and is seeking written responses with information to assist with identifying potential sources that are interested in, and capable of, providing the products described.Â  Please review the information contained herein and identify whether your company has the capability and interest to provide the brand name items listed or equivalent items that possess the salient characteristics as described.Â  Please see section titled  SUBMITTAL OF RFI RESPONSE  below for what information to include in your company s response.

GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS

The VA is requesting vendors answer the following questions in response to this notice.Â  

Are there any specifications for individual items that you believe may be too restrictive when taking into consideration industry standards (see draft Statement of Work)?Â  What specifications and why?
Are there any accessories for any equipment item that are normally separately priced?Â  What accessories?
Are there any items that you would recommend be purchased separately?Â  What items and why?
Is there any reason you would not be interested in responding to a solicitation?Â  What are the reason(s) and why?
What is the lead time on this equipment?
Does your company manufacture the items in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R. Â§ 125.6) or supply the product of a small business made in the United States?
Do you have any questions or comments that may otherwise assist us?


SET-ASIDE

Complete responses to this notice will assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside for the requirement.Â  Not providing all information requested in response to this notice may result in the VA being unable to determine a vendor potentially capable of satisfying the requirement and, subsequently, if the  rule of two  criteria is not met, a specific set-aside category may not be decided by the Contracting Officer.



AUTHORIZED DEALER/DISTRIBUTOR VERIFICATION

Gray market items are Original Equipment Manufacturer s (OEM) goods sold through unauthorized channels in direct competition with authorized distributors.Â  This procurement is for new OEM medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts) for VA Medical Centers.Â  No remanufactures or gray market items will be acceptable.

Vendor shall be an OEM, authorized dealer, authorized distributor or authorized reseller for the proposed medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts), verified by an authorization letter or other documents from the OEM, such that the OEM s warranty and service are provided and maintained by the OEM.Â  All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

The delivery of gray market items to the VA in the fulfillment of an order/award constitutes a breach of contract.Â  Accordingly, the VA reserves the right enforce any of its contractual remedies. This includes termination of the contract or, solely at the VA s election, allowing the Vendor to replace, at no cost to the Government, any remanufactured or gray market item(s) delivered to a VA medical facility upon discovery of such items.

This requirement is for new equipment ONLY; remanufactured or  gray market  items will not be accepted.Â   Gray market,  also known as parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer.

Any vendor interested in this requirement shall be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized dealer or distributor for the proposed equipment/system such that OEM warranty and services are provided and maintained by the OEM or that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment on their behalf. Â All software licensing, warrant, and service associated with the equipment/system shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

To assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside, we are requesting vendors provide the authorized dealer/distributor letter in response to this Request for Information (RFI).Â  Any future solicitation will include the requirement for vendors to provide authorized dealer verification for all items of equipment.Â  To satisfy this requirement, the vendor shall provide the original documentation from the manufacturer stating they are an authorized dealer/distributor for the items being procured.Â  This letter shall be on the manufacturers  official letter head or from an official manufacturer  email and guarantees the products are safe, are not counterfeit or adulterated devices, have maintained adequate storage conditions, and that:

All product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or 
Guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.Â  

An EXAMPLE of an acceptable OEM Authorized Dealer letter is attached (SEE ATTACHMENT 1). 

LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTING AND THE NON-MANUFACTURER RULE (NMR)

The requirement that a non-manufacturer supply the product of a small business concern is referred to
as the Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) [13 C.F.R. Â§ 121.406]. In order to qualify as a small business
concern for a small business set-aside, an offeror must either manufacture the item in accordance with
the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R. Â§ 125.6) or
supply the product of a small business made in the United States.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS/DELIVERY SPECIFICATIONS/WARRANTY SPECIFICATIONS

<SUBJECT>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR PROBABILISTIC FLOOD HAZARD ASSESSMENT SENIOR TECHNICAL REVIEW BOARD
<SOLNBR>31310018R0049
<RESPDATE>072518
<CONTACT>Sharlene McCubbin, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014155392, Email sharlene.mccubbin@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a non-competitive Time and Materials contract with Nilesh C. Chokshi for the project entitled, "Technical Assistance For Probabilistic Flood Hazard Assessment Senior Technical Review Board". The proposed period of performance for this contract is three years.<br />The statutory authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (b)(1), which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy NRC's requirements. The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong>
<p>The agency is currently reviewing two Integrated Assessments containing probabilistic risk-based analyses and anticipate that three more IAs will be submitted for review in the next fiscal year. This is a challenge for staff not only because the reviews are "first-of-a-kind" for the NRC, but also because the staff is refining guidance, tools and probabilistic methodology as these initial reviews are performed. To do so, the NRO Hydrology and Meteorology Review Branch (RHM) within the Division of Licensing Safety and Environmental Review (DLSE) has developed a two- tiered review approach. In this approach, a project-specific technical review team performs the PFHA reviews. A separate group of experts, known as the Senior Technical Review Board (STRB), provide technical and regulatory guidance to the project teams throughout the review process.</p>
<p>Because of the newness of these reviews and this process to the Agency, the individuals selected for the STRB must able to step into the role with little training. To do so, the individuals must understand a broad range of issues including (but not limited to); the events which necessitated natural hazard reanalysis (Fukushima) and the industry and Agency response to the events (the NTTF and related guidance), hydrologic flood causal mechanisms and evaluation techniques, probabilistic methodology, seismic hazard analysis methodology and implementation of the SSHAC process, plant systems and engineering, statistical analysis and coding, overall NRC structure and the Agencies guidance development process. Populating the STRB with a technical authority with such unique qualifications is vital to ensuring the completion technically sound reviews that comply with applicable guidance and methodology in an efficient manner and will promote the overall success of the team and Agency. Because of the broad nature of his experience and recognized expertise Mr. Chokshi is singularly qualified to lead this STRB. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acquisition Purpose and Objective</span></strong><br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain technical assistance and support from a recognized technical authority to function as a member of the Probabilistic Flood Hazard Assessment (PFHA) Senior Technical Review Board (STRB). The STRB is a key decision-making body providing guidance and oversight to a number of project-specific technical teams within the Agency that are performing first of a kind, complex probabilistic flooding hazard reviews for operating reactor sites as required by NTTF Recommendation 2.1. As a member of the STRB, this authority will use technical knowledge and specific experience in applying existing probabilistic methodology to developing flooding assessments at licensed nuclear facilities in a manner consistent with the established regulatory framework, existing guidance and previous Agency actions. As a member of the STRB, the authority sought in this acquisition will specifically; <br />&bull; Guide project specific technical teams in resolving technical issues in the complex and emergent field of probabilistic flood hazard analysis, <br />&bull; evaluate technical team products and make recommendations for consistency with established probabilistic seismic hazard analysis methodology, <br />&bull; Ensure that technical team products and results are aligned with applicable NTTF R2.1 guidance and established industry and Agency probabilistic flooding assessment methodology (e.g., NEI 16-05, COMSECY-15-0019),<br />&bull; Provide advice regarding project team products and aid development of PFHA guidance documents and User Needs documents, and <br />&bull; Assist in public meetings with licensees and their flooding experts.</p>
<p>Specific outcomes of the actions listed above include, but are not limited to, establishment of methodology and guidance to be used by the Agency for future PFHA reviews by technical staff, development of consensus regarding industry practice for flooding assessments. All work by the contractor needs to be fully documented in writing so the material can be preserved for knowledge transfer/knowledge management purposes for current and future NRC employees. <br />The contractor shall not have any affiliation with commercial nuclear power plants and must be conflict of interest free.</p>
<p>Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services. Detailed capability statements must be submitted to Sharlene McCubbin, Contract Specialist via e-mail at Sharlene.mccubbin@nrc.gov no later than July 25, 2018 (i.e. 15 calendar days from the date this announcement was posted).</p>

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is seeking information on new capabilities that could be enabled by current and next generation quantum computers for understanding complex physical systems, improving artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), and enhancing distributed sensing. The field of Quantum Computing (QC) has seen considerable progress in recent years, both in the number of qubits that can be physically realized, and in the formulation of new quantum search and optimization algorithms. However, numerous challenges remain to be solved to usefully employ QC to solve real world problems. These include challenges of scale, environmental interactions, input/output, qubit connectivity, quantum memory (or lack thereof), quantum state preparation and readout, and numerous other practical and architectural challenges associated with interfacing to the classical world.

<CONTACT>Michelle Gonzales , Technology Integration Manager , Phone 281.244.7640 , Email michelle.s.gonzales@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA seeks to continue efforts to advance an understanding of the relationship between Lithium ion (Li-ion) cell design and thermal runaway (TR) phenomena, which can lead to overheating and fire.
<div><br /></div>
<div>NASA is conducting research aimed at calorimetrically quantifying the heat response of Li-ion cells during TR and advancing design features, simulation and test methods for achieving safe Li-ion cell and battery pack designs. Specifically, NASA is interested in test methods which facilitate the discernment of the fraction of thermal runaway energy released through the cell casing vs. through the hot ejecta material. The purpose here is to collaborate with other entities interested in the same information, with access to commercially available Li-ion cells, and/or with access to similar test apparatus that support the discernment of the aforementioned energy fractions.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Technology:<br /><br /></div>
<div>Numerous calorimetric techniques exist today (e.g. ARC, bomb calorimetry, slug calorimetry, cone calorimetry, et...); however, these methods do not readily facilitate the discernment of the thermal runaway energy fractions. Therefore it is appropriate to say that the necessary technology does not currently exist in the public domain.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>R&amp;D Status:&nbsp;<br /><br /></div>
<div>NASA JSC developed a new fractional thermal runaway calorimeter capable of supporting the discernment of the thermal runaway energy fractions for 18650-format Li-ion cells; the device is customizable to support other cell types. This instrument is currently fully operational. It has been used over 100 times on various cell designs with turnaround time between tests as quick as 90 minutes. The instrument is portable and has been used at JSC and at other facilities.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Intellectual Property (IP):</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This Partner relationship may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner.</div>

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD to Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc (WEST).  The project will assess the impacts to birds of industrial-scale solar energy in southern California by documenting birds' use of these areas and any associated mortality. Successful completion of the project requires both new data collection and access to and analysis of existing data on avian-solar impacts.  This work requires conducting systematic bird use and mortality searches on solar facility property and in associated reference areas outside the facilities. Analysis of these data must control for various forms of searcher bias.  Also, new and existing avian mortality and natural history data from multiple solar facilities must be combined into a meta-analysis to determine what characteristics of solar facilities and species natural histories explain variation in mortality exhibited across solar sites at a regional scale.  The project calls for new data collection on avian presence and mortality at select solar facilities in southern California. Careful and systematic approaches are required to gather these data in a manner that is both representative of areas being surveyed and limits or accounts
for potential sources of biasÂ·.  Accomplishing this requires an understanding of study design considerations that apply specifically to data collection within solar facilities, the ability to identify and properly allocate resources to matched reference sites (i.e., controls), the ability to account for other forms of bias such as bird carcass removal by scavengers, and the statistical proficiency to analyze resulting datasets. WEST expertise for work with the wind and solar energy industries in assessing avian impacts of alternative energy is well established and spans hundreds of projects over many years. They are leaders in developing statistical methods for coping with bias in avian mortality searcher datasets and retain considerable expertise in metaÂ­ data analysis relevant to those required for assessing regional-scale factors influencing mortality at solar facilities. Unlike many consulting companies, much of WESTs research is published in the primary literature and therefore is exposed to the rigors of peer review. Indeed, study design considerations encountered during the conception of this project were partially informed by published work in various refereed journals by this entity.  This project will gather field data to assess avian-solar impacts locally at specific solar facilities, but addressing regional scale contextual questions concerning avian mortality requires access to already existing datasets. WEST has or is currently conducting postÂ­ construction monitoring for avian-solar impacts at most of the solar facilities identified as study sites for this project including Blythe, McCoy, Desert Sunlight, Genesis, and others. WEST retains exclusive intellectual access to the largest database of avian fatality data gathered at solar facilities, and such data are critical for understanding the regional factors that drive avian mortality across solar facilities in southern California. Over the years, the cumulative effort of WESTs field campaigns to date could not (and should not) be replicated, so in effect, access to these data would represents a substantial cost savings to the project as matching support in the form of monitoring costs (i.e., labor), equipment, and shared data. WEST also maintains facility access relationships with the solar industry that will facilitate the USGS team obtaining access to project sites as needed. Finally, WEST uses consistent data collection protocols across their project work. Using the same protocols for new data collection that are consistent with existing data ensures consistency of datasets that otherwise would not be possible if the project were forced to mix datasets from different sources. This consistency across datasets reduces 'noise' in any resulting analysis that would otherwise reduce our sensitivity for detecting the potential impacts to birds the projects seeks to explore.  This data is proprietary to WEST.

<SUBJECT>B--Cosmogenic radionuclide dating of rock
<SOLNBR>140G0318Q0116
<CONTACT>Ciccarelli, Cheryl
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source 
The U.S. Geological Survey, Earthquake Science Center, Menlo Park, CA has a requirement cosmogenic radionuclide dating of rock fragments and sediments, including sample preparation and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement.  The lab determines the in situ abundance of a specific nuclide in the quartz component of a geologic sample. The nuclides targeted are 10Be (beryllium) and 26Al (aluminum).  The laboratory is to perform the sample preparation as well as AMS measurement of both 10Be and 26Al, including: crushing and grinding of clast or sand-sized particles; quartz separation and purification; chemical extraction of BeO and Al2O3; and target preparation. The requirement is to analyze 35 samples for both nuclides. Established QA/QC procedures for sample preparation and peer-reviewed documentation of analytical success for both nuclides in small abundances are required. In particular, the lab should achieve background ratios of 1x10-15 or less for both nuclides.
The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541380. The size standard is $15.0 million dollars.
The USGS intends to make a non-competitive award to PRIME Lab, Purdue University. The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) (1).  The samples provided for CRN dating must be crushed and ground, quartz mineral must be extracted, separated, then the target material, BeO and AlO must be chemically extracted, and finally the AMS target is measured.  While other labs can complete the final stage (measurement of the AMS) for BeO, no other lab can complete the aluminum measurements.  Also, only the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory offers the specific pretreatment required for these samples.  Pre-treatment includes crushing and grinding of clast or sand-size particles.   
The anticipated contract will be firm fixed price. 
This is not a request for quotation, and the Government does not intend to pay for information received. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government evaluation of the information received. All questions and submissions in response to this notice must be submitted electronically via email to Cheryl Ciccarelli cciccarelli@usgs.gov by 5:00 PM ET on July 16, 2018.

The proposed services, which will be obtained by negotiated firm fixed price contracts, are for a variety of architect/engineer (A/E) services primarily for Army, Air Force, other military and government, and civil works projects at various locations within the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division mission boundaries. Projects outside the primary mission area may be added at the government's discretion upon agreement of the A/E firm.<br />Projects will be awarded by individual task orders. The maximum cumulative contract value for each contract is $5,000,000. These are five year contracts, with no option years. The estimated construction cost per project is between approximately $2,000,000 and $10,000,000.<br />Up to two firms will be selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second. Award of all contracts will be made within nine (9) months after award of the first contract provided there is sufficient workload. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between firms considered as technically equal. The following factors will be used in deciding which selected firm will be utilized on task orders: performance and quality of deliverables, current capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, and uniquely specialized experience. Significant emphasis will be placed on the A/E's quality control procedures, as the District will perform the quality assurance role only. Estimated start date is October 2018.<br />In accordance with FAR 36.604 and supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, all task orders above $35,000 will receive a performance evaluation. A performance evaluation may be prepared for lesser task orders and interim performance evaluations may be prepared at any time. Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for A/E services.<br />2.) PROJECT SPECIFIC INFORMATION: The selected firms will be solely responsible for the designs that they produce, and will become the designer of record for each individual project on their contract. Projects may consist of military projects for the U.S. Army, Air Force, and other military and government customers of USACE Louisville District. This contract may also be utilized for civil works projects. Military work is anticipated to be the largest percentage of work (approximately 90%).

<DESC>Solicitation Number: W912QR18R0065<br /><br />Presolicitation <br />Synopsis:
<p>1.) SYNOPSIS: This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. The proposed services, which will be obtained by negotiated firm fixed price contracts, are for a variety of architect/engineer (A/E) services primarily for Army, Air Force, other military and government, and civil works projects at various locations within the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division mission boundaries. Projects outside the primary mission area may be added at the government's discretion upon agreement of the A/E firm.<br />Projects will be awarded by individual task orders. The maximum cumulative contract value for each contract is $9,000,000. These are five year contracts, with no option years. The estimated construction cost per project is between approximately $2,000,000 and $50,000,000.</p>
<p>Up to four firms will be selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second, and so on. Award of all contracts will be made within nine (9) months after award of the first contract provided there is sufficient workload. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between firms considered as technically equal. The following factors will be used in deciding which selected firm will be utilized on task orders: performance and quality of deliverables, current capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, and uniquely specialized experience. Significant emphasis will be placed on the A/E's quality control procedures, as the District will perform the quality assurance role only. Estimated start date is October 2018.</p>
<p>If a large business is selected to negotiate a contract, the firm will be required to present an acceptable Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507 prior to award of the contract.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.604 and supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, all task orders above $35,000 will receive a performance evaluation. A performance evaluation may be prepared for lesser task orders and interim performance evaluations may be prepared at any time. Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for A/E services.</p>
<p>2.) PROJECT SPECIFIC INFORMATION: The selected firms will be solely responsible for the designs that they produce, and will become the designer of record for each individual project on their contract. Projects may consist of military projects for the U.S. Army, Air Force, and other military and government customers of USACE Louisville District.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS RFI. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. The Government will not pay for any response expenses. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government is specifically interested in technologies, methodologies, ideas and solutions for the Manatee Harbor DMMA offload to Washington Park Project. The information received will be used to support a market analysis for the project goal of creating additional capacity in the Dredge Material Management Area and beneficially using the dredge spoil to create a park in an approximately 80-acre area of Manatee County that has historically been economically depressed. <br /><br />Background:
<p>The project requires the removal of up to 300,000 cubic yards of material from the existing Manatee Harbor Dredge Material Management Area (DMMA), transport the material to Washington Park which is approximately 8 miles away, and deposit the material in a specified location. The contractor will not be responsible for grading of the material deposited at Washington Park. The goal of the project is intended to make beneficial use of dredge spoil to create a park in an approximately 80-acre area of Manatee County that has historically been economically depressed. Currently, Washington Park consists of an abandoned shallow borrow pit with vegetation dominated by nuisance and exotic species. Washington Park has the capacity to hold up to 1.1 Million cubic yards of material.</p>

<p>52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors:</p>
</p>
<p>(i) Price<br /><br />(ii) Technical Approach<br />A.Staffing<br />a.Qualifications of Personnel Proposed<br />b.Plan to Backfill or Replace Personnel as needed<br />c.Status of Security Clearances for Personnel Proposed<br />d.Number of FTEs Proposed<br /><br />B.Project Management<br />a.Management Plan for Deliverables and Quality Control<br />b.Communication Plan</p>
<p>
<p>(iii) Past performance</p>
<p>Offers must first be determined acceptable in both technical capability and past performance in order to be considered eligible for award. For technical capability to be considered acceptable, the offer must clearly demonstrate how the Offeror will meet the minimum performance requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). For past performance to be considered acceptable, the Government must have a reasonable expectation, based on the offeror's performance record, of recent and relevant information, that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. To be considered recent, information must not be older than six (6) years of the date set for receipt of quotes. In the event an offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance, the offeror will not be rated favorably or unfavorably.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>TAKE NOTE:<br />(1) The offeror's technical capability will be evaluated based on information furnished by the offeror. The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the offer.</p>
<p>(2) Evaluation of Option to Extend Services under 52.217-8. For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services, provided under FAR 52.217-8, as follows: The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time during any contract performance period, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but for no more than a total of six months during the life of the contract. The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR<br />52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract when the option is exercised. The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise. This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.</p>
<p>(3) The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.</p>
<p><br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Mar 2015)<br />The Offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

(a) Definitions. For the purposes of this provision and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below:

(1) "Trade Secret" means an unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials which are trade commodities.

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells."

(b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend:

"The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract."

(c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend:

"This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal."

(d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction.

(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information.

(f) The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision. If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision, the offeror concerned shall be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p><strong>Note to the Proposed Contractor</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Security Clearance<br /></strong>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the IHS (Indian Health Service). Before starting work requiring routine access to IHS facilities or systems each person must complete an FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an IHS employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for IHS processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an IHS site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of IHS sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The IHS utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the eQIP entry to the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the Service Unit for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>OIG Exclusion List<br /></strong>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

<p><br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p><br />** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **</p>
<p>Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the<br />Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes,<br />prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only<br />upon such contingencies as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage<br />determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract,<br />adjusting the contract price, etc." (The relevant CBA section) in the collective<br />bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that<br />Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting "arm's length negotiation" under<br />section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations. This wage<br />determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits<br />paid under the predecessor contract.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE<br />Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444)</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming<br />procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of<br />contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of<br />conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be<br />retroactive to the commencement date of the contract (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(iv)(C)(vi)). When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE)<br />for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for<br />proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or<br />disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or<br />where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This<br />report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days<br />after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, for review (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to ensure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<br />determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<br />subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).</p>

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.<br />3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.<br />b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.<br />7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).<br />e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.<br />f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.<br />1330-52.222-71 - NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY APPLICABLE TO CREW MEMBERS OF VESSELS UNDER NOAA CONTRACT OR ORDER (MAY 2018)<br />(a) General Policy.<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NAO 202- 1106 prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. The NAO includes NOAA's mandatory requirements for completion of sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training.<br />It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract or order. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention.<br />(b) Applicability.<br />The policy set forth in NAO 202-1106 applies to all contractor employees identified as crew members on vessels secured for use under a NOAA contract or order. Prior to performance, the contractor shall provide all contractor employee crew members an awareness briefing on the requirements of the NAO and a copy of or access to a copy of the NAO. All contractor employee crew members must comply with the NAO, which includes completion of the mandatory training provided by NOAA as described in (d) below.<br />The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract for services involving the use of vessels so that it is binding on each subcontractor.<br />(c) Definition.<br />Contractor Employees - As used this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.<br />Attachment 2 AA 18-06<br />2<br />(d) Mandatory Training.<br />1. Completion of initial mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training is required for all contractor employees identified as crew members in performance of this contract or order, in accordance with NAO 202-1106. This training will be provided by NOAA.<br />a. The training will include by-stander intervention training and specific steps on how to prevent and report sexual assault and sexual harassment, as well as training on drug and alcohol awareness in the workplace. The training will typically be provided within two (2) hours of the vessel's departure from port.<br />b. A copy of NAO 202-1106 will be provided to each crew member upon initial boarding of the vessel. Each crew member must sign a form managed by the vessel's Commanding Officer/Operations Officer verifying they have received and will comply with the NAO in its entirety.<br />2. For vessels at sea for more than 12 months, annual sexual assault and sexual harassment training, provided by NOAA, will be required pursuant to NAO 202-1106. The specific</p>
<p>format of the training will depend on the availability of resources (e.g. internet access).<br />(e) Reporting Incidents of Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment.<br />Contractor employee crew members should refer to NAO 202-1106, Section 6, Reporting Incidents of Sexual Harassment or Sexual Assault, at .07, Reporting from Remote Locations, when reporting incidents of sexual assault or sexual harassment.<br />(f) Remedies.<br />In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of NAO 202-1106 or other Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, or regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment may result in:<br />1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action;<br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract;<br />5. Suspension or debarment; or<br />6. Other appropriate action.<br />(End of Clause)<br />1330-52.237-70 Contractor Communications (Apr 2010)<br />CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATIONS<br />(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.<br />(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.<br />(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.<br />(End of Clause)<br />1330-52.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT<br />(SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non- personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Clause)<br />COAST GUARD INSPECTION<br />Performance under this contract is dependent on the vessel passing a U.S. Coast Guard safety examination. The Coast Guard inspection shall be performed no earlier than two weeks before the vessels' scheduled departure and the Coast Guard certification must be obtained by the vessel, no less than one week prior to scheduled departure. In the event that the contractor does not obtain the Coast Guard inspection, the Government may terminate the contract, and the contractor may be liable to the Government for excess re-procurement costs. Inspection is required before the commencement of each charter year, unless the Coast Guard has issued a letter of inspection that is valid for the time period of the charter. The contractor will arrange for the inspection, and any costs associated with bringing the vessel to passing standard shall be borne by the contractor. A copy of the Coast Guard certification shall be posted on the vessel.<br />(End of Clause)<br />CHARTER VESSEL SAFETY<br />The contractor shall adhere to the safety regulations as set forth in Coast Guard rules effective on September 15, 1991, and as provided for by the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act of 1988 (specifically, 46 CFR Part<br />28) or subsequent additions or revisions. These regulations require that specified vessels be equipped with a variety of safety features and equipment.<br />A Coast Guard inspection of the vessel based on an interagency agreement between National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the Coast Guard or 46 CFR Part 28 will be required prior to performance. In addition to the requirements of 46 CFR Part 28, the Coast Guard inspection will require conformance with standards for<br />lifesaving and firefighting equipment in the Rules for Small Passenger Vessels, which exceed the requirements of 46 CFR Part 28. Issuance of the notice to proceed by the Government is conditioned upon the successful completion of the mandatory Coast Guard inspection under Part I, Paragraph 15 of this contract. Failure of the Contractor to successfully complete the inspection requirements shall be grounds for termination of this<br />contract. Conformance with present regulations for commercial fishing vessels requires that the master or an individual in charge of the vessel ensures that safety drills and instruction are conducted at least once a month (46 CFR 28.270). Following personnel changes, safety orientations must be given to each individual on board that has not received the instruction or has not participated in the drills, prior to continuation of vessel operations. The contractor shall conduct such safety orientations prior to sailing on each cruise leg. Due to the frequent wholesale exchange of scientific personnel at cruise breaks, it is recommended that a full drill be completed early in each cruise leg even if less than a month has elapsed since the last drill. Each vessel must also have all required emergency instructions posted (46 CFR 28.265).<br />(End of Clause)<br />MECHANICAL BREAKDOWNS OR NON-PERFORMANCE<br />The contractor is responsible for maintaining all contractor provided equipment and vessels in a safe operating condition during contract performance. If a mechanical breakdown of the vessel occurs or other contractor provided equipment that is greater than 12 hours cumulative within a 24-hour period that begins at 0700 and ends at 0659, the vessel and all contractor provided equipment shall be considered off charter and make-up fishing days may be required at no additional cost to the Government.<br />The charter shall also be considered off charter if the Captain or Crew of the boat is unable to perform the duties as outlined in the Statement of Work in increments of time greater than 12 hours cumulative within a 24-hour period that begins at 0700 and ends at 0659. The contractor shall make every reasonable effort to resolve the problem causing the vessel, contractor provided equipment or Captain and Crew to be out of service and bring it back into service as quickly as possible to continue contract performance. Mechanical breakdown periods in excess of four<br />(4) consecutive or four (4) cumulative days may be grounds for termination of the contract. In the event that the breakdown requires the vessel to return to port for repairs, the vessel will not be considered back on charter until the vessel returns to active survey status as determined by the Contracting Officer in consultation with COR. (End of Clause)<br />FIREARMS<br />The Government prefers that no firearms be carried on board during the charter. However if the vessel has firearms on board that cannot reasonably be removed prior to the charter, the firearms may stay on board if the COR gives approval prior to the vessel departure. Any firearms approved for carriage during the charter period, must be kept locked in the Captain's quarters at all times during the charter. Onshore use of firearms shall be at the discretion of the Captain.<br />(End of Clause)<br />POSSESSION OF LIQUOR/ILLEGAL DRUGS<br />During the charter period, the possession or use of intoxicating liquor and/or illegal drugs by any person is not permitted and may be grounds for termination of this contract by the Government.<br />(End of Clause)<br />CONTROL OF PLASTIC DISCHARGES<br />Contractor shall comply with the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987, which establishes Federal requirements for controlling plastic discharges from ships.<br />(End of Clause)<br />WORKING CONDITIONS FOR GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL<br />The contractor shall provide safe, efficient working conditions and accommodations to the Government personnel free from violence, threats of violence, harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, and other disruptive behavior. The contractor, its agents, subcontractors, and employees, including the Captain and crew of the vessel shall not harass, assault, oppose, impede, intimidate, threaten, interfere with or make unwelcome advances toward any member of the Government field party. Violation under this clause may result in termination of the contract, at the discretion of the Government under the "Termination for Cause" paragraph of FAR 52.212-4, and in consequent liability of the contractor to the Government for any costs incurred, as well as debarment, suspension or similar action from future participation in government contracts.<br />(End of Clause)<br />PRESENCE OF FAMILY MEMBERS<br />Unless serving as crew, the spouses or children of crew members or owner(s) may not accompany the vessel during the term of the charter without obtaining written approval in advance from the vessel captain. Liability for any family members allowed on board during the charter is solely the responsibility of the contractor.<br />(End of Clause)<br />RECREATIONAL FISHING<br />Scientists and vessel's crew members may engage in recreational fishing upon obtaining permission from the vessel's Captain. Recreational fishing must be done in full compliance with the recreational fishing laws and regulations in effect at the fishing locality. Fish and shellfish caught recreationally may be consumed aboard the vessel or, with permission of the captain, be retained for consumption after the completion of the charter.<br />Recreationally caught fish which are retained should be clearly marked as such, including the license holder's name. It is the responsibility of each recreational fisherman to meet all legal and license requirements relative to the capture, landing, and possession of recreationally caught fish.<br />(End of Clause)<br />LIAISON AND COORDINATION<br />The Contractor shall coordinate efforts with the Contracting Officer or a designated representative. Any request or recommendation for a change shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer for necessary implementation, if applicable.<br />(End of Clause)<br />HARMLESS FROM LIABILITY<br />The contractor shall hold and save the Government, its officers, agents, and employees harmless from liability of any nature or kind, including costs and expenses to which they may be subject or on account of any or all suits or damages of any character whatsoever resulting from injuries or damages sustained by any person or persons or property by virtue of performance of this contract, arising or resulting in whole or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the contractor, or any subcontractor, their employees, and agents.<br />(End of Clause)<br />1330-52.203-70 Scientific Integrity and Research Misconduct<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision -<br />Scientific activities mean activities that involve inventorying, monitoring, observations, experimentation, study, research, integration, modeling, and scientific assessment.<br />Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.<br />Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America.<br />Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.<br />Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend appropriate action.<br />(b) General Guidelines<br />1. Maintaining Integrity. The Contractor shall maintain the scientific integrity of research performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations and adjudications of allegations of research misconduct.<br />2.

The Contractor shall insert the substance of this provision in subcontracts at all tiers that involve research being performed under this contract.<br />(c) Investigating Misconduct Research<br />1. Initiating Investigation. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it shall notify the contracting officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the Contractor shall:<br />a. Promptly conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of scientific and research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.<br />b. If the investigation leads to a finding of scientific and research misconduct, obtain adjudication by a neutral third party adjudicator. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.<br />2. Finalizing Investigation. When the investigation is complete, the Contractor shall forward to the contracting officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).<br />Back to Top<br />(d) Findings and Corrective Actions<br />1. If the Contractor finds that scientific and research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process and shall:<br />a. Take all necessary corrective actions, which includes, but are not limited to, correcting the research record, and, as appropriate, imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future, and<br />b.

<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, July 19, 2018.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.</p>
<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>
<p>(1) &#9633; In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) &#9633; Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;</p>
<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p><br />NAM 1330-52.270-304 ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<p><br />NAM 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted ________ hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.<br />(End of Contract Language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-71 GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018)</p>
<p>In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. (a) Definitions. Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: &bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; &bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; &bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures. A (b) Requirements. 1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. 2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. 3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). 4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable. Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance. i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace</p>
<p>a.     Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed. ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106. 5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. (c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline. For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including: &#9679; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 &#9679; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org &#9679; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) &#9679; Text: (202) 335-0265 (d) Confidentiality. Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.</p>
<p>b.    (e) Remedies. In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in: 1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; 2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; 3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; 4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; 5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action.</p>
<p><br /> (XIII) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.<br />(XIV)  Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 5 P.M. MST on July 19th, 2018.  All quotes must be emailed or faxed to the attention of Ryan Stroud. The email address is ryan.stroud@noaa.gov, and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>

<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.</p>
<p>(b) Requirements.</p>
<p>1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.<br /><br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.<br /><br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.</p>
<p>Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.</p>
<p>Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace</p>
<p>Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.</p>
<p>ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p><br />5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. (c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
<p>&#9679; Phone: 1-866-288-6558<br />&#9679; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org <br />&#9679; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)<br />&#9679; Text: (202) 335-0265</p>
<p>(d) Confidentiality.</p>
<p>Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties. 3</p>
<p>(e) Remedies.</p>
<p>In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:</p>
<p>1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial<br />action;<br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of <br />5. Suspension or debarment; or<br />6. Other appropriate action. <br />(End of contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-70 Contractor Communications</p>
<p>(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.</p>
<p>(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.</p>
<p>(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.</p>
<p><br />(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MDT on July 23, 2018. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Diana Romero. The E-mail address is Diana.Romero@noaa.gov and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>
<p>(XVI) Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Diana Romero, (303) 497-3761, E-email address is diana.romero@noaa.gov .</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NON-RECEIPT OF QUOTES. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION OF THE QUOTE RECEIPT.</p>
