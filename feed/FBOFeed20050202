<DESC>POSITION DESCRIPTION

1. BACKGROUND

USAID’s Democracy and Governance (DG) portfolio in Zambia has as its objective activities that promote more accountable government. The DG Strategic Objective (SO8) “Government is Held More Accountable” targets permanent structural reforms to reduce public sector abuse of office and corruption through: rule of law reforms, which encompasses improving the criminal justice system and sustained corruption prevention; public demand for accountability; and strengthening watchdog institutions. DG program activities aim to build more effective, responsive and accountable democratic institutions and are directed toward three intermediate results areas: 1) Rule of law enhances accountability; 2) Citizens and civil society organizations demand accountability; and 3) Effective oversight institutions. The current DG (SO8) bilateral (SOAG) was signed March 2004 and is to run until September 2010 with a total budget estimate of US$10 million.

The DG portfolio is implemented in the context of a complex political environment. The issues of political accountability and executive dominance, and the concomitant issue of systematic corruption condition developments in all significant institutional arenas. The prevailing absence of political accountability has deep historical roots in Zambian political history and is embedded both in the structure of institutions and in the informal norms that govern the behavior of political actors and citizens throughout the political system. It has contributed to the development of a culture of impunity among the powerful, and a culture of avoidance that governs the behavior of those who are not. The stalling of political liberalization after the 1991 transition resulted in large part the failure to alter institutional arrangements designed to entrench executive ( in practice, presidential) domination of both state and ruling party structures during the period of one party rule. The dilemma of Zambian politics is how to break the Gordian knot that confronts efforts to reduce, channel and redistribute the power of the executive, since such efforts are ultimately subject to executive approval. In the present political context, the prospects for such reform appear closely linked to what is perhaps the second most pressing political and developmental issue in Zambia – reducing the prevalence of official corruption, which drains scarce developmental resources and seriously undercuts state legitimacy.

While constitutional reform is the vital structural change on which achievement of the SO greatly depends, other tactics are necessary as means to return Zambia to its 1991 ideals to increase government accountability and transparency. Enforcement must be stepped up as a means of corruption deterrence. Parliament must become an effective oversight, and civil society must continue to apply pressure.

Civil society rather than government or political opposition is the prime force that will drive change. The “zeitgeist” that will inspire Zambians over the next decade is eliminating corruption; and a successful fight against corruption will significantly improve Zambia’s economy.

Following the 2001 election and the installation of the Mwanawasa administration, the President was blunt in stating a policy of “zero-tolerance” for corruption, and that he would institute a ‘government of laws and not of men’ emphasizing that the new administration  would be strictly governed by the rule of law. He dismissed or demoted a number of senior government officials associated with corruption (or the failure to deal with it) under the previous government including the Attorney General, Minister of Information, and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance. The budget of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) was increased significantly and its facilities were upgraded. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the judiciary interpreted these signals by moving aggressively on corruption cases, with close allies of Former President Chiluba under investigation. In July, 2002, Mwanawasa set up a corruption task force with the mandate to recover resources stolen by the previous administration and to investigate and prosecute former officials, including Chiluba. Following an impassioned speech by Mwanawasa to Parliament in July 2002 on corruption in the previous administration, Parliament removed the Constitutional immunity from Chiluba, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court in February 2003. Chiluba was then charged on 59 counts of corruption. The former president and several senior public officials have since been put on trial for a myriad of corruption offences.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Northwest Fisheries Science Center, has a requirement for a fishing vessel to help conduct surface pair-trawling to sample juvenile salmonids containing passive integrated transponders (PIT) tags in the Columbia River.   It is anticipated that there will be two proposed sample periods each year, on in the spring (May to early June) and one in the fall (September to November).  There will be an estimated sixty-four (64) active sampling days per year and sixty-six (66) inactive sampling days per year.  It is also anticipated that there will be three, one year option years for sampling which will be exercised pending available funding.  Sampling will be performed as tides and currents allow while working eight to ten hours per day, five or six days per week.   A similar schedule will occur in the fall; however sampling may be limited to three or four days per week every other week.    

Contractor shall provide a suitable vessel with a minimum overall vessel length of 8.5 m (28 ft.) with 250 horsepower or greater.  A power stern-reeling gillnet vessel is desired.  An inboard mounted gas or diesel engine (no out-drive) and adequate tow point are required.  An accessory winch/boom capable of picking a minimum of 160 kg (350 pound) load (PIT-tag detection antenna) under dynamic conditions prevalent in rough weather shall also be provided by the Contractor.  The vessel must have sufficient deck area within easy reach of the winch to store the antenna (about 1 meter in diameter and 0.5 meters long) when not deployed.  On-deck storage of a small (2m x 1.5m wide), plastic pontoon “Hobe-cat” used to house detection electronics is also required.  Vessel shall be equipped with navigational and communication equipment such as radar, GPS, and marine VHF radio.  A dry, secure storage area inside the cabin is required for storage of scientific equipment.  Clean and sanitary accommodation for day use (eating space) for the five crew members is desired.  Crew berthing arrangements will be made under a separate contract.  Vessel is required to have a storage facility to retain all refuse to be deposited ashore in proper trash receptacles.  

Solicitation documents will be available for download on or about February 16, 2005.  A written request must be sent to NOAA/WASC/AMD, Attention: Kristina Loesell, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle WA 98115-6349. Telephone or facsimile requests for the solicitation package will not be accepted. The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.

The VSBP system provides backup to various communications voice switches used by air traffic control personnel at Air Traffic Control Towers and Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities.  This contract extension will enable the FAA to: (1) Continue uninterrupted deployment of VSBP systems with scheduled Enhanced Terminal Voice Switch (ETVS) deliveries over the next 2 years, (2) Continue to provide supply support to over 300 installed systems and (3) Provide tailored expansion of presently installed VSBP systems as required. DME Corporation designed, developed, tested and is currently providing VSBP Systems to the FAA.  Under this planned contract extension, deliveries are required on a one per month basis beginning in June 2005 through December 2005 and as required through June 2007.  DME Corporation has the technical expertise and production capability to perform this work within the timeframe required, and can meet the required deliveries concurrent with scheduled ETVS installations.   The VSBP system meets the following requirements: Â·	Operates totally independent of (existing/new) voice switch system (i.e. ETVS, ICSS, IVSR, NVS, RDVS, STVS). Â·	Provides direct connectivity between air traffic controller and existing air-to-ground radio communication equipment for primary frequency(s) assigned to that air traffic control operational position. Â·	VSBP system activation must be by a positive action by the air traffic controller (insertion of the air traffic controller's headset plug into the Voice Switch ByPass jackbox). Â·	Provides a push-to-talk signal compatible with the push-to-talk requirements of existing primary air-to-ground radio communication equipment system (both local and remote). Â·	Provides an audio path (both transmit and receive) compatible with requirements of existing primary air-to-ground radio communication equipment system (both local and remote). Â·	Is capable of manual reassignment and connection of primary air-to-ground radio communication equipment system to existing air traffic control position. Â·	Provides a transparent interface compatibility with the existing air traffic control facility legal voice communication recorder system. If your firm can immediately meet this requirement you should contact the Federal Aviation Administration, ATTN: Stephen Bobby, ATO-A, 800 Independence Ave. SW, Washington, DC  20591, Telephone 202-493-4786.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Administrative Support Center (EASC), is seeking sources to provide data collection services for inshore and offshore fisheries in the state of New York.  The objective of the proposed contract is to provide the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Gloucester, Massachusetts and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC) with fishery dependent and independent data relative to the commercial fisheries of New York.  Work under this proposed contract will be conducted with the marine fishing industry of New York, specifically with those dealers, vessels and harvesters of Long Island and adjacent waters.  Data collected under the contract will serve as inputs toa variety of areas, including biological analysis and stock assessments, regulatory impact analysis, quota allocations and monitoring, economic profitability profiles, trade and import tariff decisions, allocation of grant funds among states, identification of ecological interactions among species and documentation of vessel fishing histories.  The work shall be performed in close cooperation and coordination with the NYDEC.  Tasks may specifically involve fisheries which occur in New York’s internal waters, those waters under federal jurisdiction, or both depending on industry developments and requirements.  The ultimate goal is to obtain complete information on marine fisheries by obtaining data and other information from industry, providing information back to industry and coordinating with all affected entities.  Without the basic fisheries statistics that the above collections will provide, NMFS and NYDEC would be unable to fulfill the majority of its scientific research and fishery management missions, which must be based on the best available scientific information.  As the magnitude and scope of these data collection programs expand, the requirement for proficient data processing capabilities becomes paramount to the success of the programs.  Two criteria which are critical to this information pathway are the timeliness and accuracy of the processed data.  The NMFS Northeast Regional Office, Fishery Statistics Office is responsible for processing the above fishery logbook data.   An indefinite-delivery type contract is anticipated.  The period of performance will be one year base period beginning May 1, 2005, plus four one year option years.  The contractor should be located on or near Long Island, New York.  The applicable NAICS code is ¬¬¬¬¬518210.  This action is not a small business set-aside, and is anticipated above the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00.  Interested parties may submit a request for the solicitation in writing to the Acquisition Management Division, 200 Granby Street, Suite 815, Norfolk, VA 23510.  Fax requests will be accepted at (757) 441-3786.  The solicitation may be issued electronically.  Therefore, all interested parties are requested to include an e-mail address on any request for the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a response to the solicitation that will be considered by the agency.  Offerors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database (CCR) prior to contract award.  Numbered note 26 applies.

White Sands Missile Range (WSMR, White Sands or Installation) is a national test range designed to support research, development, testing, and evaluation for the Army, Navy, Air Force, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other approved U.S. government agencies and foreign governments.  The range also plans and conducts development testing and evaluation of Army missiles, rockets, and materiel systems.

WSMR is located in south-central New Mexico in a region known as the Tularosa Basin between the Sacramento Mountains to the east and the San Andres and Organ Mountains to the west. The Main Post /Headquarters Area is 20 miles east of Las Cruces, NM and 45 miles north of El Paso, TX. The range boundaries extend almost 100 miles north to south by 40 miles east to west. At almost 3,200 square miles the range is the largest military installation in the country.

The range opened on 9 July 1945 as White Sands Proving Ground and later renamed to White Sands Missile Range.  One week after it’s opening, the first atomic bomb was exploded on the range at an area known as Trinity Site.  Missile testing began in September 1945 with Tiny Tim firings and “took off” with captured German V-2 rockets in 1946.  White Sands served as the landing site for the space shuttle Columbia on 30 March 1982, at the range’s Northrup Strip.

White Sands has over 840 sets of family quarters.  Temporary quarters are usually available for the new families.  Civilian personnel are authorized on-base housing, on a space-available basis.  Sixty-four units are available for unaccompanied military personnel as well. Today, WSMR is divided into five major areas:  Main Post Area, Small Missile Range, MAR, Rhodes Canyon Camp, and Stallion.
Wastewater Utility System Description
The WSMR Sanitary Wastewater (wastewater) Collection System comprises all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the point in which the Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation defined by the real estate instruments. Generally, the point of demarcation will be the building footprint. The system includes, but is not limited to the treatment facilities, manholes, and the collection piping including service laterals. This description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the collection system. The inventory is assumed to be approximately 90 percent complete. The Offeror shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and, to a lesser degree, this description. Under no circumstances shall the Offeror be entitled to any rate or cost adjustments to the contract, based on the accuracy of the Government's description and inventory. The WSMR wastewater collection system is a conventional series of gravity flow laterals, mains, and manholes.  There are three small can type lift stations at WSMR.  All wastewater treatment is either by the main post treatment plant, a package unit at a remote site (DATTS East), or a septic tank system (Stallion Range Camp).  The collection system comprises approximately 201,410 linear feet of vitrified clay, transite, and PVC piping with associated manholes.  The average age is approximately 40 years, but all of the PVC piping has been installed in recent years.  Pipe sizes range from 4 to 21 inches.  Building services are predominantly four, six, and eight inches.

The main post area is serviced by a 1 MGD trickling filter sanitary treatment plant constructed in 1958.  The 21 inch inlet flows into the headworks with a mechanically cleaned bar screen and debris separator.  Waste then enters a Parshall flume where it is split and directed to two 35-foot diameter primary clarifiers.  The plant contains four splitter boxes, two 100-foot diameter trickling filters, two 35-foot diameter primary and secondary digesters, two pump houses, two 35-foot diameter secondary clarifiers, a sludge recirculation pump, and heat exchanger.  There is a new, three-cell, reinforced polymer concrete drying bed system.  The DATTS East area uses a package plant with effluent flowing to an approximately one-acre evaporative lagoon.  The Stallion Range Camp sanitary system uses a septic tank and multicelled evaporative lagoon system approximately 1.8 acres in size.  A separate evaporative lagoon approximately 0.25 acre in size receives waste water from the water treatment plant.
Water Utility System Description
Water is supplied exclusively from deep wells in the Tularosa and Hueco Basins in the Main Post Area and the Rio Grande Basin at the Stallion Range Camp.  The universal problem of declining static water levels is a particular concern at WSMR because of the close proximity of salt water.  The Stallion Range complex also uses well water, which is highly saline and must be treated prior to storage and distribution. 

Generally, it must be recognized that potable water, regardless of the quality, is a precious commodity in this water-starved region, especially in view of the burgeoning requirements of the El Paso/Juarez municipalities. The Army is vitally interested in protecting the existing water rights for the WSMR and Fort Bliss installations, and are therefore not included as part of the Scope of this privatization action.

J02.2.1 Total Storage and Distribution System

A total of 839,382 lineal feet of mains and lateral lines were scaled from utility maps provided by the Installation. Subsequent review of the draft inventory report by the WSMR indicated there were 1.3 million lineal feet of water lines. This disparity is due probably to incomplete and out-of-date utility maps.  The system comprises various pipe sizes and material types, as well as valves, air relief valves, back flow preventers, post indicator valves, monitoring and warning systems, fire hydrants, and storage tanks. Though the average age of the system is approximately 30 years and some repairs are needed, the system is in relatively good condition.

J02.2.2 Main Post Area/SMR/MAR

The Main Post, located in the extreme southwest corner of WSMR, covers approximately 1,650 acres and accommodates housing, administrative, and technical facilities.  There is a large distance between components in these areas.  The small missile range and the MAR are included in the main post area description however they differ in the pressure located at each area.  

The SMR/MAR areas include a 10-inch water line from the Main Post supplies the Launch Complexes and Orogrande area from the two 400,000-gallon ground storage tanks to the 200,000-gallon elevated tank at LC-38. A booster station then pumps water through a 10-inch line to the Orogrande Range Camp and storage tanks on Elephant Mountain. The elevated storage structures are equipped with cathodic protection, depth indicators, warning systems, and altitude transmitters. The tanks have been recently overhauled and are in excellent condition.

Eleven potable wells serve the Main Post Area and collectively produce approximately 600 to 700 million gallons of water per year.  Wells 10A and 15A have emergency back up engines. Four potable wells and a booster station provide water from the Soledad Canyon region.  The SMR area contains one submersible well rated at 80 gpm.  The MAR area contains three wells that feed the Helstef region and one well used for fire protection as well as construction.

Raw water is pumped through a 60,000-gallon sedimentation tank. The tank has 12-inch inlets and outlets that are separated from the settling zone by steel baffle plates. Sludge is drawn off into a concrete trench, collected in a 10-inch line and drained to a dry wash. The water is then chlorinated and fluoridated before entering the ground storage tanks. 

Water storage for the Main Post area is provided by two (each one million gallon elevated storage tanks), a 200,000-gallon elevated storage tank, two 400,000-gallon ground storage tanks, two 10,000-gallon ground storage tanks ,and a 200 gallon ground storage tank. The structures are equipped with cathodic protection, depth indicator and warning systems, and altitude transmitters. All tanks have been overhauled in recent years and are in excellent condition. 

J02.2.3 Rhodes Canyon Area

Water is currently being supplied by truck to this area that presently does not have any active wells or treatment facilities.  Water is stored in two ground storage tanks.  Notwithstanding, the Government has identified a project to construct a well in this area at a future date.  

J02.2.4 Stallion Area

Water is pumped from two wells.  The wells are approximately 800 feet deep with submersible pumps set at 400 feet. One four-inch diameter well, currently out of service, produces about 90 GPM and the other well (six-inch diameter) produces approximately 150 GPM. Distribution is through 6- and 8-inch transite pipes, installed in the 1960s. 

Because of the high salt content, an ion-exchange plant treats the water at the Stallion Range to bring it to drinking quality.  Plant capacity is 120,000 GPD and comprises three independent units. Two were installed in 1989 and the third in 1993.

Well water is pumped to the surface and then flows by gravity into two 20,000-gallon raw water tanks. After treatment, the water is pumped from an underground 20,000-gallon tank to a 150,000-gallon above ground tank, from which it is boosted to a new 500,000-gallon above ground storage on a nearby hill.  An unused 100,000-gallon elevated storage tank in the area will be demolished by the government and is not included in this inventory.

Gas Utility System Description
The WSMR natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation, and/or Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation defined by the real estate instruments. Generally, the point of demarcation will be the building footprint. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description. Under no circumstances shall the Offeror be entitled to any rate adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.

Natural gas is supplied to WSMR by Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM). Gas is metered at four delivery points.  These delivery points are the Main Post Area, NEL, NIKE, and CNG Station. Gas is supplied at the Main Post area through two (3½-inch and 2½-inch) high-pressure (300 psi), coated and wrapped steel (C&WS) lines.  Downstream of the meter and regulator, where distribution pressure is reduced to 22½ psi, all distribution components are owned and maintained by WSMR. The housing natural gas distribution system has been replaced in recent years, except for that portion of the housing complex scheduled for demolition. Areas to be demolished were not included in this inventory.  There are approximately 224,000 lineal feet of distribution pipe. The most common pipe is 2-inch and 4-inch C&WS. The recently rehabilitated housing system is plastic pipe. Pressure is reduced from the 22½-psi distribution pressure by individual facility regulators. The system age/construction year varies up to 45 years old. With the exception of the housing area, minimal investment has been committed to system maintenance.

<DESC>Sources Sought.     Klondike Gold Rush National Historic Park (KLGO) is currently seeking potential sources for historical research, design and construction of the Moore Homestead Cultural Landscape in Skagway, Alaska. The scope of work includes but is not limited to: researching the Moore Homestead Landscape to establish appropriate historic appearance and appropriate historic species composition, elaboration of existing historic design as outlined in the draft Cultural Landscape Report (treatment section), including detail drawings and specifications for construction, and the implementation of approved design. Specific products include but are not limited to: brief report on historic precedence of design and historic seed sources, establishing a viable 'kitchen garden' which re-creates the historic kitchen garden at the Moore House property, providing certified historic seed stock from appropriate species of plants (cooperation with KLGO Park staff in determining appropriate species is vital), re-creating a historic flower-bed using historic seed stock, re-install historically placed trees of specimen grade, install local flagstone to mark footprint of historic buildings which no longer exist, and development of a long-term maintenance brief for Park personnel. Contractor will be responsible for removing and disposing of existing soil and replacing it with sterilized and amended soil suitable for gardening. Contractor will be responsible for all labor, supervision, management, tools, materials, equipment, facilities, transportation, incidental engineering, and other items necessary to accomplish the goals outlined above in a timely manner. Preference is for an established design/build firm with experience in historic landscape restoration. This is NOT a request for proposal and no solicitation is available at this time. A market search is being conducted to determine interest and capability of potential sources from Small Business firms. All interested parties are invited to respond.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) executes the mission and functions of the Missile Defense Data Center (MDDC) under an agreement with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).  The contractor will be expected to provide MDDC mission support to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in developing and fielding an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) by managing past, present and future MDA-related data products from Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) technology research, developmen t, testing, and evaluation, M&S and service specific Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence data facilitating access to MDA-related data products across the MDA enterprise; and producing MDA-related data products to support MDA technology, devel opment, testing and evaluation.  The MDDC program will revolve around executing the following four key functional areas:   1) Core Functions  2) Disaster Recovery   3) Legacy Data  4)  Non-Core Functions.  In general, the contractor selected for award will  be expected to provide support as set forth in the Scope of Work (SOW).  These areas are not meant to be definitive, but rather represent in summary form, the general areas to be supported.  Therefore, the SOW is deemed to be a basic expression of the ove rall contract requirement.  Specific performance requirements will be set forth in the Task Orders (T/Os) issued under the contract.  The T/Os may be issued in support of any area of the current MDA Data Centers Program Management Plan (MDA DCP MP), as am ended.  The MDDC contract will be managed by SMDC via a contract-level Technical Monitor (TM)  and Task Order Monitor (T/OM) assigned to each specific Task Order. In general, the contractor will be expected to: 1) collaborate with the government and work t ogether to provide the vision, direction, plans and execution to increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the MDDC Program and its processes; 2) collaborate and interface with the other MDA Data Centers and contractor(s) of similar organization s to share information and best practices; 3) monitor other data centers development, processes and results as well as those of current industry leaders to identify and recommend best practices that may be adopted or adapted to improve the overall efficie ncy and effectiveness of the MDDC.  Stake holder and customer satisfaction, cost control, and technical performance shall be considered during the process; 4) procure hardware and software as required per T/O requirements; 5) maintain government-furnished property/government furnished equipment (GFP/GFE); maintain and operate the MDDC during government business hours and, upon special request, 24/7, on weekends, and government holidays; 6) maintain the GFP/GFE to provide data access and analysis capability to government-designated users during government business hours; 7) track and identify the GFP/GFE as required to pass inspections; 8) support the MDDC by publicizing the MDDC to the MDA Community, its potential users and programs by way of sending MDDC re presentatives to exhibits, symposiums, conferences and participating contractor sites (with proper approvals). It has been determined that the resultant contract will not contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause.  The MDDC will be locate d in a government facility in Huntsville, Al for the duration of the contract.  All effort under the resultant contract will be performed at the MDDC Facility (currently located at 106 Wynn Drive, Huntsville, AL).  All contractor personnel working at the g overnment location must have at least a secret security clearance and at least 25% of the contractor personnel working at the government location must possess a top secret security clearnance.   The Government anticipates the award of one contract.  The ac quisition is 100% set-aside for small business competition.  Small Businesses should note the FAR 19 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and size standard is 541710/1000 employees. This acquisition is not open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The resultant contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and set aside fo r small business.  It will consist of a one-year basic and four (4) one-year options.  The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propo se as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams). Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award.  The proposal, in response to W9113M-05-R-0002, is due to this of fice on 8 Apr 2005 with past performance data due on 15 Mar 2005.  Additional information, as well as the RFP, when released, is/will be available at the MDDC Website http://www.smdc.army.mil/contracts/mddc.html.  NO PAPER COPIES OF THE RFP WILL BE PROVIDE D NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINED FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS THE RFP WILL BE POSTED ON THE ABOVE WEBSITE ADDRESS.

<SUBJECT>S -- Privatization of Utility Systems for White Sands Missile Range, NM
<SOLNBR>SP0600-05-R-0016
<RESPDATE>090105
<CONTACT>Martha Gray, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-9415, Fax 703-767-2382, Email martha.gray@dla.mil
<DESC>Privatization of Gas Distribution, Water and Wastewater Utility Systems at White Sands Missile Range, NM

This acquisition is for the privatization of the natural gas, water and wastewater distribution systems at White Sands Missile Range, NM.  Privatization is the complete divestiture and transfer of ownership of a U.S. Government-owned utility system to a non-Government entity.  In conjunction with the purchase of the systems, the contractor will also be required to provide (as needed) improvements, upgrades; repairs; expansions; investments; and plant replacement, as well as continued operation and maintenance of the utility distribution systems.  The following guidance has established the necessary requirements to accomplish Utility Privatization (UP):  10 U.S.C. 2688 (1997) and OSD UP Guidance (09 Oct 02).
White Sands Missile Range Overview
White Sands Missile Range (WSMR, White Sands or Installation) is a national test range designed to support research, development, testing, and evaluation for the Army, Navy, Air Force, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other approved U.S. government agencies and foreign governments.  The range also plans and conducts development testing and evaluation of Army missiles, rockets, and materiel systems.

WSMR is located in south-central New Mexico in a region known as the Tularosa Basin between the Sacramento Mountains to the east and the San Andres and Organ Mountains to the west. The Main Post /Headquarters Area is 20 miles east of Las Cruces, NM and 45 miles north of El Paso, TX. The range boundaries extend almost 100 miles north to south by 40 miles east to west. At almost 3,200 square miles the range is the largest military installation in the country.

The range opened on 9 July 1945 as White Sands Proving Ground and later renamed to White Sands Missile Range.  One week after it’s opening, the first atomic bomb was exploded on the range at an area known as Trinity Site.  Missile testing began in September 1945 with Tiny Tim firings and “took off” with captured German V-2 rockets in 1946.  White Sands served as the landing site for the space shuttle Columbia on 30 March 1982, at the range’s Northrup Strip.

White Sands has over 840 sets of family quarters.  Temporary quarters are usually available for the new families.  Civilian personnel are authorized on-base housing, on a space-available basis.  Sixty-four units are available for unaccompanied military personnel as well. Today, WSMR is divided into five major areas:  Main Post Area, Small Missile Range, MAR, Rhodes Canyon Camp, and Stallion.
Wastewater Utility System Description
The WSMR Sanitary Wastewater (wastewater) Collection System comprises all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the point in which the Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation defined by the real estate instruments. Generally, the point of demarcation will be the building footprint. The system includes, but is not limited to the treatment facilities, manholes, and the collection piping including service laterals. This description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the collection system. The inventory is assumed to be approximately 90 percent complete. The Offeror shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and, to a lesser degree, this description. Under no circumstances shall the Offeror be entitled to any rate or cost adjustments to the contract, based on the accuracy of the Government's description and inventory. The WSMR wastewater collection system is a conventional series of gravity flow laterals, mains, and manholes.  There are three small can type lift stations at WSMR.  All wastewater treatment is either by the main post treatment plant, a package unit at a remote site (DATTS East), or a septic tank system (Stallion Range Camp).  The collection system comprises approximately 201,410 linear feet of vitrified clay, transite, and PVC piping with associated manholes.  The average age is approximately 40 years, but all of the PVC piping has been installed in recent years.  Pipe sizes range from 4 to 21 inches.  Building services are predominantly four, six, and eight inches.

The main post area is serviced by a 1 MGD trickling filter sanitary treatment plant constructed in 1958.  The 21 inch inlet flows into the headworks with a mechanically cleaned bar screen and debris separator.  Waste then enters a Parshall flume where it is split and directed to two 35-foot diameter primary clarifiers.  The plant contains four splitter boxes, two 100-foot diameter trickling filters, two 35-foot diameter primary and secondary digesters, two pump houses, two 35-foot diameter secondary clarifiers, a sludge recirculation pump, and heat exchanger.  There is a new, three-cell, reinforced polymer concrete drying bed system.  The DATTS East area uses a package plant with effluent flowing to an approximately one-acre evaporative lagoon.  The Stallion Range Camp sanitary system uses a septic tank and multicelled evaporative lagoon system approximately 1.8 acres in size.  A separate evaporative lagoon approximately 0.25 acre in size receives waste water from the water treatment plant.
Water Utility System Description
Water is supplied exclusively from deep wells in the Tularosa and Hueco Basins in the Main Post Area and the Rio Grande Basin at the Stallion Range Camp.  The universal problem of declining static water levels is a particular concern at WSMR because of the close proximity of salt water.  The Stallion Range complex also uses well water, which is highly saline and must be treated prior to storage and distribution. 

Generally, it must be recognized that potable water, regardless of the quality, is a precious commodity in this water-starved region, especially in view of the burgeoning requirements of the El Paso/Juarez municipalities. The Army is vitally interested in protecting the existing water rights for the WSMR and Fort Bliss installations, and are therefore not included as part of the Scope of this privatization action.

J02.2.1 Total Storage and Distribution System

A total of 839,382 lineal feet of mains and lateral lines were scaled from utility maps provided by the Installation. Subsequent review of the draft inventory report by the WSMR indicated there were 1.3 million lineal feet of water lines. This disparity is due probably to incomplete and out-of-date utility maps.  The system comprises various pipe sizes and material types, as well as valves, air relief valves, back flow preventers, post indicator valves, monitoring and warning systems, fire hydrants, and storage tanks. Though the average age of the system is approximately 30 years and some repairs are needed, the system is in relatively good condition.

J02.2.2 Main Post Area/SMR/MAR

The Main Post, located in the extreme southwest corner of WSMR, covers approximately 1,650 acres and accommodates housing, administrative, and technical facilities.  There is a large distance between components in these areas.  The small missile range and the MAR are included in the main post area description however they differ in the pressure located at each area.  

The SMR/MAR areas include a 10-inch water line from the Main Post supplies the Launch Complexes and Orogrande area from the two 400,000-gallon ground storage tanks to the 200,000-gallon elevated tank at LC-38. A booster station then pumps water through a 10-inch line to the Orogrande Range Camp and storage tanks on Elephant Mountain. The elevated storage structures are equipped with cathodic protection, depth indicators, warning systems, and altitude transmitters. The tanks have been recently overhauled and are in excellent condition.

Eleven potable wells serve the Main Post Area and collectively produce approximately 600 to 700 million gallons of water per year.  Wells 10A and 15A have emergency back up engines. Four potable wells and a booster station provide water from the Soledad Canyon region.  The SMR area contains one submersible well rated at 80 gpm.  The MAR area contains three wells that feed the Helstef region and one well used for fire protection as well as construction.

Raw water is pumped through a 60,000-gallon sedimentation tank. The tank has 12-inch inlets and outlets that are separated from the settling zone by steel baffle plates. Sludge is drawn off into a concrete trench, collected in a 10-inch line and drained to a dry wash. The water is then chlorinated and fluoridated before entering the ground storage tanks. 

Water storage for the Main Post area is provided by two (each one million gallon elevated storage tanks), a 200,000-gallon elevated storage tank, two 400,000-gallon ground storage tanks, two 10,000-gallon ground storage tanks ,and a 200 gallon ground storage tank. The structures are equipped with cathodic protection, depth indicator and warning systems, and altitude transmitters. All tanks have been overhauled in recent years and are in excellent condition. 

J02.2.3 Rhodes Canyon Area

Water is currently being supplied by truck to this area that presently does not have any active wells or treatment facilities.  Water is stored in two ground storage tanks.  Notwithstanding, the Government has identified a project to construct a well in this area at a future date.  

J02.2.4 Stallion Area

Water is pumped from two wells.  The wells are approximately 800 feet deep with submersible pumps set at 400 feet. One four-inch diameter well, currently out of service, produces about 90 GPM and the other well (six-inch diameter) produces approximately 150 GPM. Distribution is through 6- and 8-inch transite pipes, installed in the 1960s. 

Because of the high salt content, an ion-exchange plant treats the water at the Stallion Range to bring it to drinking quality.  Plant capacity is 120,000 GPD and comprises three independent units. Two were installed in 1989 and the third in 1993.

Well water is pumped to the surface and then flows by gravity into two 20,000-gallon raw water tanks. After treatment, the water is pumped from an underground 20,000-gallon tank to a 150,000-gallon above ground tank, from which it is boosted to a new 500,000-gallon above ground storage on a nearby hill.  An unused 100,000-gallon elevated storage tank in the area will be demolished by the government and is not included in this inventory.

Gas Utility System Description
The WSMR natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation, and/or Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation defined by the real estate instruments. Generally, the point of demarcation will be the building footprint. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description. Under no circumstances shall the Offeror be entitled to any rate adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.

Natural gas is supplied to WSMR by Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM). Gas is metered at four delivery points.  These delivery points are the Main Post Area, NEL, NIKE, and CNG Station. Gas is supplied at the Main Post area through two (3½-inch and 2½-inch) high-pressure (300 psi), coated and wrapped steel (C&WS) lines.  Downstream of the meter and regulator, where distribution pressure is reduced to 22½ psi, all distribution components are owned and maintained by WSMR. The housing natural gas distribution system has been replaced in recent years, except for that portion of the housing complex scheduled for demolition. Areas to be demolished were not included in this inventory.  There are approximately 224,000 lineal feet of distribution pipe. The most common pipe is 2-inch and 4-inch C&WS. The recently rehabilitated housing system is plastic pipe. Pressure is reduced from the 22½-psi distribution pressure by individual facility regulators. The system age/construction year varies up to 45 years old. With the exception of the housing area, minimal investment has been committed to system maintenance.
All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.     Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.     The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.     Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.     In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.     If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.     Interested sources shall contact Martha Gray at 703-767-9415 to be added to our bidder mailing list.     
A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL.     The solicitation will be available on or after February 25, 2005.

<DESC>Sourses Sought: The Mid South Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) 764 located at 5171 Sam Jared Drive, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 has a need for new pucks. The pucks are use on an assembly line to hold 120 ml bottles or 250cc bottles that are being filled at various stages on the assembly line. The current pucks are made of UHMW material. The cylinder has two dimensions, which is the base and top. The base of the cylinder size is approximately 3.75 inches wide with 1.92 inches in height. The tops section of the puck is approximately 3.10 inches in width and a height of 2.30 inches. The material insides the top portion of the puck is removed so the bottles will set during assembly line transfer or filling of bottle.

For the larger bottles, the section removed is approximately 2.71 inches in width and 2.75 inches in depth. The contractor shall design the new pucks so a 35mm metered chip can be installed from the top of the puck. The pucks that holds the smaller bottle will be a color and the pucks that holds the larger bottle will be a different color for easy recognition on the assemble line. The contractor shall engrave each puck with a numeric number on the outside of the top portion of the puck. The numeric sequential numbers for engraving shall range from a three-digit number to a four-digit number.  The bottom of the pucks will be scarred/itched to provide a rough surface for movement on the assembly line. The estimated value is $50,000.00 to $100,000.00.  Interested parties should contact Dale Sites, Contracting Officer at Mid South CMOP 764, 5171 Sam Jared Drive, Murfreesboro, TN 37130. Faxed information may be sent to 615-867-5799.

The parking lot provides a work area for work sheds, storage laydown, dumpsters, above ground gas storage tanks as well as parking space to support the facility operations. The parking lot was constructed approximately 30 years ago, and it is almost entirely surrounded by wetlands along Suisun Bay. The surrounding area is managed by California Department of Fish and Game and a private duck club. On the East side, an elevated pier leads to the floating MARAD office barge. On the West side, an access road paved on fill leads to the upland area and Highway 680. In recent years the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet has experienced shutting down the parking lot due to flooding caused by heavy rains and or high tides. See attached pictures. Review design documents, as-built drawings for the existing parking lot. Note: Certain reference materials such as old Geotechnical studies, Topographic map, and Parking area improvement drawings, which are available through Maritime Administration; but this agency will contest to the completeness or accuracy of these documents, and the contractor would need to agree to use them at their own risk.

<DESC>Contractor shall provide all required psychological assessment services for incumbent VA police officers and police officer applicants for the Phoenix VA Medical Center.   The psychological assessments shall be performed in accordance with the guidelines in attached VA directives which provide guidance designed to determine an officer's capability of conducting designated functional requirements essential to the duties of a VA police officer and an officer's suitability to carry a firearm.

EVALUATION CRITERIA
 
CAPABILITY OF THE OFFEROR

USAID will assess (evaluate) the capability of each offeror on the basis of its organizations experience, past performance, and cost.  USAID will use its assessment of capability as a basis for comparing offeror’s to determine best value.  This will be fixed price contract using best value trade-offs.


Evaluation Factors

a.	Experience  50%
USAID will evaluate each offeror’s technical experience in event/meeting planning and its relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective contract.
 
b.	Past Performance 50%
USAID will contact the offeror’s previous customers to ask if (1) the offeror’s performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (2) the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during the performance period; and (3) what level of customer satisfaction they received from the offeror.
  
c.	Cost Proposal -   Under a best value source selection, nonprice evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  USAID will consider an Offeror’s past performance and experience to be equal in importance.  However, the USAID will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  

Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors - Best Value Source Selection

Nonprice evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  An offer must be acceptable in order for the offeror to be eligible for award.  USAID will not award a contract on the basis of an unacceptable offeror.  USAID will not select an offeror for award on the basis of superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  The relative influence that capability and price will have on source selection authority will depend on the differences among competing offerors where USAID will rank each offeror and make tradeoffs in the differences in capability and the price (FAR 15.101-1).

<DESC>Privatization of Gas Distribution, Water and Wastewater Utility Systems at Fort Bragg, NC

Description

The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of Gas Distribution, Water and Wastewater Utility Systems at Fort Bragg, NC.
Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacement. As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc. of the systems to assure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement. The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale. The Installation and utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

OVERVIEW
The Fort Bragg/Pope Air Force Base complex is not a typical DoD installation. First it is a very large complex, encompassing over 160,000 acres. It is true that much of this area consists of range area with minimal utilities, but it still remains an exceptionally large installation. Perhaps the most important distinguishing characteristic is the dynamic nature of the complex, particularly on Fort Bragg and satellite Camp MacKall. The missions of this Installation, described in subsequent paragraphs, have been receiving priority funding for the past several years and that trend is projected to continue for the foreseeable future. Robust MILCON and OMA funding have transformed and will continue to radically change the real property facilities and infrastructure of Fort Bragg. This ongoing massive construction program obviously drives changes to Fort Bragg’s utility infrastructure. Generally, the new system owner must be flexible and willing to make necessary adjustments to keep pace with Fort Bragg changes. Another important general requirement is that the new owner must be able to “spin up” very quickly; a slow-paced transition will not be possible.

Fort Bragg is located in the Sandhills Region of the south-central portion of North Carolina, 10 miles northwest of downtown Fayetteville and 90 miles northwest of the Atlantic Ocean. The nearest neighboring major cities include Raleigh, 50 miles to the northeast; Charlotte, 100 miles to the west; and Columbia, South Carolina, 142 miles to the southwest. The Cape Fear River is six miles to the east and Interstate 95 is approximately 12 miles southeast of the Cantonment. The northern boundary of the Cantonment borders Pope Air Force Base. Fort Bragg’s reservation extends across portions of four North Carolina counties: Cumberland, Hoke, Moore and Harnett. The Cantonment is located in Cumberland County, while the Range and Training Area is located primarily in Hoke, Moore and Harnett counties. Camp MacKall, consisting of an airfield and training areas on 7,917 acres, is located approximately 6.6 miles (30 miles from the Cantonment area) west of Fort Bragg in Moore, Richmond and Scotland counties.
The Cantonment is the urbanized portion of Fort Bragg. The primary routes to Fort Bragg from Fayetteville include the All American Freeway, Bragg Boulevard (Route 24/87) and Murchison Road (Route 210/87). Bordering the Cantonment to the west and south is the crescent-shaped Greenbelt, a forested area that supplies habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker, a federally-listed endangered species. Fort Bragg has 13 named family housing neighborhoods consisting of more than 4,700 homes located throughout the Cantonment. In the center of the Cantonment is the Old Post Historic District, a planned environment of buildings, roads and open spaces characterized by the formal geometry of the Beaux Arts style of urban design. Fort Bragg’s real property inventory reflects more than 4,900 buildings that provide more than 29 million square feet of space.
Pope Air Force Base, located on the north side of Fort Bragg, is integrally associated with Fort Bragg. Pope AFB has 580 buildings encompassing approximately 3.3 million square feet of space. Though Pope covers 2,157 acres, only 263 acres are fee-owned by the Air Force. The remaining 1,894 acres are actually owned by Fort Bragg and permitted to the Air Force. Pertinent planning criteria associated with Pope AFB will be discussed in subsequent paragraphs. There will be no effort to segregate or separately identify these Pope AFB utility components from Fort Bragg’s. All utility components included in the package should be considered Fort Bragg assets.
Satellite Locations:
Extraterritorial Lands
Although its land area encompasses more than 250 square miles, Fort Bragg cannot accommodate within its boundaries all of the training required by its assigned units. As a result, training frequently is conducted on extraterritorial lands, which are public and private lands located off the Installation proper. These lands total approximately 1.3 million acres. There are no utility components to be considered for privatization on these extraterritorial lands.
Fort Bragg Housing
In May 2002, the Army selected Picerne Military Housing, LLC (Picerne) to privatize the family housing estate at Fort Bragg. As Fort Bragg’s selected partner, Picerne manages all family housing neighborhoods for the duration of a 50-year lease. Prior to commencing the partnership, Picerne and Fort Bragg staff prepared the Post’s Community Development and Management Plan (CDMP). Picerne has projected that all construction in the initial phase of reconstruction will be completed by 2013. The second and third phases of reconstruction will take place during the ensuing 40 years of the lease. 
The Army/Picerne Partnership was formally established through the corporate entity, “Bragg Communities, LLC.” Bragg Communities, LLC took over the housing estate on 1 August 2003. The initiative privatized 4,746 family housing units. The project includes the demolition of 1,568 existing homes and construction of 2,652 new homes. The remaining inventory of 2,928 dwelling units, which includes 209 historic homes, will be renovated and maintained as needed. At the end of the 10-year development period (Phase I), the inventory will be 5,578 units. The privatization eliminates 1,526 inadequate units and a deficit of 834 four-bedroom units.
Three new neighborhoods will be developed in the northern portion of Northern Training Area IV (NTA IV). The RCI parcel consists of approximately 1,064 acres of mostly wooded land located adjacent to North Carolina Highway 24/87. A total of 1,538 new homes will be constructed. 
The housing privatization contractor, Bragg Communities, LLC will construct the natural gas distribution system which will serve new family housing construction on the Installation. Bragg Communities, LLC will connect this new natural gas distribution system to the existing Fort Bragg natural gas system. All of this construction and tie-in to the existing Fort Bragg distribution system will be at the expense of Bragg Communities, LLC. Bragg Communities, LLC will construct this distribution system to accepted utility standards. At the completion of construction, Bragg Communities, LLC, will convey the newly constructed distribution system to the appropriate natural gas system privatization contractor for ownership, operation and maintenance, and repair consistent with points of demarcation described in RFP.
Army family housing utility mains and service laterals generally have been retained by the Government and are, therefore, part of the UP package. Points of demarcation are covered in subsequent paragraphs for both utility components privatized under the RCI process and those retained by the Government which are included in the privatization package
Pope AFB Housing
Pope AFB has its own family housing complex with a total of 627 dwelling units. Unlike Fort Bragg, Pope AFB has no current plans to privatize the housing complex which is currently under a contractor-performed maintenance contract. Utility mains and laterals are included in the overall UP package and points of demarcation will be as described in RFP

Gas Distribution System Description
The system may include, but is not limited to, regulating stations, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be conveyed to the Contractor using the Bill of Sale (sample shown in RFP) at the time the system is transferred. 
System Description
Natural gas is delivered by NCNG to Fort Bragg via a 12-inch main at a location behind the Knox Street warehouses. Pope AFB obtains its natural gas through Fort Bragg. The 12-inch main operates at 150 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). This pressure is regulated down to 25 psi at 32 separate delivery points that serve various areas.
The majority of the distribution system components located within Fort Bragg are owned by the Government and operated by Fort Bragg personnel. There are sections of pipe owned and operated by NCNG and Honeywell. NCNG owns, operates and maintains the gas line from the delivery point (behind the Knox Street warehouses) north to Longstreet Road, as well as the majority of gas line along Longstreet Road and Reilly Street. Honeywell owns, operates and maintains gas lines that serve the following: Simmons AAF, the Soldier Support Center, Ardennes Street, buildings along 775TH SFG Way, and the H-Area (i.e., Smoke Bomb Hill). Fort Bragg and Honeywell have an existing contract under which Honeywell installs, owns, operates and maintains gas lines and meters for a fixed period (14 years) from the date of installation. Honeywell-owned lines will not transfer to the new owner via privatization until September 2015 or until completion of the contractual period for each portion of the line.

Potable Water System Description

The Fort Bragg potable water system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to on-base wells, pumping stations, water treatment and distribution components and, for off-base sources, the distribution system. The system includes, but is not limited to, pumps, water treatment components, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, post indicating valves, storage facilities, backflow prevention devices, and meters. This water treatment and distribution system privatization package also includes the Pope AFB water system and the water system at Camp MacKall.
All water rights (pumping or purchased) will remain with the Government.
Specifically excluded from the water treatment and distribution system privatization package:
&#61656;	Non-potable fire protection system, including deluge tanks, pipe, pumps, altitude valves, etc.
&#61656;	Irrigation systems
&#61656;	Swimming pool facilities
&#61656;	Range water wells and small system-dedicated wells
&#61656;	Wash Rack Facility
System Description
This section describes the water systems at Fort Bragg, Pope AFB and Camp MacKall. Fort Bragg has a standby potable water purchase agreement with the City of Fayetteville and is connected to the City’s 16-inch water main at the intersection of Gruber and Murchison Roads.
FORT BRAGG WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM
Raw Water
Fort Bragg is located within the boundaries of the Cape Fear River Basin. Raw water is withdrawn from the Little River, which flows eastward along the northern boundary of the Installation. The state of North Carolina classifies the water source as surface water. The Little River is a tributary of the Cape Fear River and has an estimated safe yield of 16 million gallons per day (MGD). Flow in the Little River primarily originates from Crystal Lake and the James River. Fort Bragg owns 25 miles upstream of its withdrawal point and owns nearly the entire watershed except a few tributaries. The watershed consists of approximately 326,000 acres of sandy long-leaf pine forests.
Two raw water intakes can be utilized to withdraw water from the Little River. The primary intake is located adjacent to the raw water pumping station. A secondary intake is located one mile upstream from which water flows by gravity through a 30-inch pipeline to the raw water pumping station (when the 30-inch valve is open). A small dam diverts flow from the river through a traveling mesh screen and then into the wet well located underneath the pump house. The raw water pumping station located on Little River’s south bank houses a traveling screen assembly and raw water pumps.
There are 10 pumps which move water from the wet well to the facility headworks through two 16-inch transmission lines which combine into one 20-inch pipeline. The pump types and rated capacities are listed in the following table. The pumps are of varying capacity ranging from 1,000 to 4,900 gallons per minute (GPM) with a total rated capacity of 30,400 GPM or 43.8 MGD. A diesel-powered backup pump is also available which is rated at 5,600 GPM (8.1 MGD). The electric raw water pumps withdraw water through intake lines submerged into the wet well at a depth of one foot from the bottom. Damage has occurred to these pumps in the past due to inoperable travel screen and the accumulation of sand and debris in the wet well, and also from drought conditions experienced in the Summer of 2002.
The Fort Bragg Water Treatment Plant has a rated treatment capacity of 10.6 MGD. Calculated on a monthly basis between Jan 2002 and Dec 2002, actual daily production varied from a low of 3.34 MGD during the winter to a high of 13.27 MGD during the summer. Instantaneous operating flow (i.e., not sustained over an entire day) was 16.0 MGD. Average daily consumption, again calculated on a monthly basis, ranged from 5 MGD during the winter to 9 MGD during the summer.
Distribution System 
The high service pumps move water from the treatment facility into the treated water distribution system. The distribution system was originally constructed in 1918. The current system is comprised of approximately 370 miles of pipe and associated appurtenances serving about 5,200 service connections. The water service mains range in size from 2-inch to 24-inch diameter pipe. Distribution system pipe material includes asbestos cement, cast iron, ductile iron, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic. There are no known lead lines. The system operates on two pressure zones with pressure reducing valves on the four interconnections between the high and low service areas. Distribution system pressures are adequate ranging from 50-110 psi with most of the installation at a pressure of about 75-psi. There is no cathodic protection system for the metal water pipes. A Drinking Water Study in progress at Pope AFB has identified pressures as high as 150 psi in hydrants on the industrial side of the Base (the closest points to the FBWTP); normal pressures recorded in the industrial side during this study were in the range of 95 to 130 psi. In the housing areas, the hydrant pressures ranged from 75 to 103 psi.
The distribution system has six potable water storage facilities not considering the clearwells. The combined water storage volume is 4.75 million gallons. There are two tanks at Simmons AAF for fire suppression tanks (total storage volume of 0.376 million gallons), excluded from the water system privatization package. The Old and New Division tanks, SOCOM tank, and Tank Hill standpipe all serve the high-pressure zone of the distribution system. Level transmission signals from Main Post, New Division, Old Division, COSCOM, Tank Hill, and SOCOM are transmitted via radio signal to a chart recorder and SCADA in the control room at the water treatment facility. 
Booster Pumping Stations
There are seven booster pumping stations within the water system.. Each pump has a rated capacity of 1,750 gpm for a combined capacity of 5,250 gpm. 
Supplemental Source of Potable Water
The Fort Bragg potable water system was connected to a 16-inch Fayetteville municipal water main at Murchison Road and Gruber Road in 1982.
CAMP MACKALL
Camp MacKall water system is an independent system and is supplied with metered potable water by the City of Southern Pines. Potable water is supplied through an 8-inch water main from the water treatment plant in Southern Pines. The Southern Pines water treatment plant is located near the intersection of Route 1 and Thunder Road, approximately two miles north of the Rowe Training Facility. Potable water from the water treatment plant is supplied through an 8-inch water main along Route 1, which then connects to an 8-inch water main along Special Forces Way. The Army owns the 8-inch water line that is approximately 3 miles long. The point of demarcation between the City of Southern Pines and the U.S. Army is where the 8-inch water line connects with the 8-inch water main that leaves the water plant. A network of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), cast iron and galvanized steel mains distribute potable water around the RTF. According to Fire Department personnel, the water distribution network has adequate water pressure for fire protection, but does not produce the required fire flow of 1,000 gallons per minute. The Camp MacKall water system consists of approximately 26,000 feet of water mains ranging from less than 4” to 8”, five main valves, and 3 fire hydrants. 
Wastewater Collection and Treatment System Description

The Fort Bragg wastewater system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system as defined by the points of demarcation beginning at the connection to the treatment provider and ending at each end use facility. The system may include, but is not limited to, sewage mains, manholes, lift stations, valves, controls, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be conveyed to the Contractor using the Bill of Sale shown in RFP at the time the system is transferred. 
If the Contractor proposes to use an alternative source of wastewater treatment, the proposal shall include provisions for demolition of the existing plant.
System Description
The wastewater system consists of pumping stations, mains, laterals, valves, ejector pumps, and a treatment plant. Specifically excluded from privatization of the wastewater collection and treatment system are:
&#61656;	Storm water systems
&#61656;	Oil/water separators, except those integral to the lift stations
&#61656;	Grease traps
&#61656;	Septic tank systems
&#61656;	Centralized vehicle wash facility and the associated pond
&#61656;	Camp MacKall: The lift station and force main that is owned and operated by Moore Water and Sewer Authority.
FORT BRAGG WASTEWATER SYSTEM
The wastewater system at Fort Bragg includes service laterals, manholes, collection mains, lift stations, force mains, and a treatment plant. The wastewater collection system located inside the fence of Pope AFB is included in this privatization action. Most of Fort Bragg’s existing wastewater collection pipes are constructed of vitrified clay, concrete, or reinforced concrete. Minor quantities of PVC and acrylonitrile butadine styrene plastic pipe also are used. The force mains are constructed primarily of ductile iron, cast iron or asbestos cement. Minor quantities of PVC and ABS also are used in the force mains. There are various small lift stations or ejector pumps, and eleven major lift stations. All the major lift stations have emergency power and are monitored at the wastewater treatment plant, Utilities Distribution, Environment Compliance Branch, and Pope AFB Operations by telemetry SCADA.
The collection system handles domestic and some minimal non-domestic wastewater. Non-domestic wastewater is generated in fabrication shops, repair shops, overhaul shops, depot facilities, printing shops, food services and medical services. Industrial wastewater is discharged to the sanitary sewer system. Vehicle maintenance and refueling areas are equipped with oil/water separators, which are the only means used to pre-treat industrial wastewater. The current treatment facilities are able to adequately treat industrial wastewater with respect to NPDES permit limits. Wastewater flows generally in a northerly direction to Fort Bragg Wastewater Treatment Plant, including 11 major lift stations
FORT BRAGG WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
Fort Bragg Wastewater Treatment Plant (FBWWTP) treats domestic and a portion of non-domestic wastewater. Industrial flows (motor pools, replate shop, hospital, medical clinics, dental clinics, on-post laundry, wash racks) are estimated by post personnel as accounting for five to ten percent of the average daily flow recorded at the wastewater treatment plant. The FBWWTP is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Wastewater is treated in an activated sludge, extended aeration and secondary treatment system (clarifiers only). The wastewater treatment plant was constructed in 1941, upgraded in 1981, and rebuilt in 1991. The current plant was designed with a capacity of 8 million gallons per day (mgd) with a maximum hydraulic capacity of 13 mgd. The average daily flow is 5 mgd during dry weather; however, during wet weather flows near its maximum hydraulic capacity have been recorded. The North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources conducted a study in 2000 that concluded the plant was at 68 percent capacity. The plant’s NPDES permit (No. NC0003964, Outfall 001), limits the daily maximum and monthly average concentrations of specified pollutants.
WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT OPERATION
GENERAL DESCRIPTION/CONSIDERATIONS
The WWTP receives mostly domestic sewage and some non-domestic flow from vehicle and aircraft maintenance and washing facilities, and photography, x-ray, medical, and dining facilities.
The following permits are in existence at this time:
•	NPDES at WWTP (NC2300647)
•	Sludge Production and Disposal (WQ001965)
•	WW Collection System and Lift Stations (WQS00029)
Influent entering the WWTP receives preliminary treatment consisting of a mechanically cleaned bar screen, followed by a vortex grit chamber. The flow from this chamber is split and sent to two parallel, semi-circular oxidation ditches for extended aeration. Secondary treatment is continued in clarifiers, which provide sludge-liquid separation. Secondary effluent disinfection by chlorine gas is provided in secondary clarifiers (Solid Waste Management Unit (SWMU) 42, FTBR-042) and inoperable ultraviolet disinfection tanks (Chlorine Contact Tank (SWMU 44, FTBR-044). De-chlorination of final effluent is enhanced by stepped cascade (SWMU 46, FTBR-046) aeration prior to discharge into the Lower Little River.
This requirement is unrestricted.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Interested sources should contact Kimberly Binns at 703-767-9652 to be added to our bidder mailing list (via e-mail, see below.)
