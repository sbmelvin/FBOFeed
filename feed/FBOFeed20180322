<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. <br /><br />AFRL/RITE requires a purchase of fiber collimators with required parameters, quantities, and specifications that are listed below:<br /><br />Qty. of 6<br />Model #: FC10-VIS1-APC <br />Description: Fiber collimator, 11.9mm aperture, fine 80 pitch adjustable collimation with locking feature, broadband AR coating from 350nm to 600nm, wavefront error &lt;1/10 wave rms over 1/e^2 points, FC/APC receptacle. Yields ~5.5mm beam at 1/e^2 points.
<p>Qty. of 5<br />Model #: FC5-VIS1-APC <br />Description: Fiber collimator, 7mm aperture, fine 80 pitch adjustable collimation with locking feature, broadband AR coating from 350nm to 600nm, wavefront error &lt;1/10 wave rms over 1/e^2 points, FC/APC receptacle.

<p>Qty. of 11<br />Model #: FC10R-1.0 <br />Description: Ring adapter to mount FC10 onto any 1 inch mount.</p>
<p>Qty. of 5<br />Model#: FC10FS-UV-APC <br />Description: Fused silica fiber collimator, 11.9mm aperture, fine 80 pitch adjustable collimation with locking feature, broadband AR coating from 240nm to 440nm, wavefront error &lt;1/10 wave rms over 1/e^2 points, FC/APC receptacle. Yields ~5.5mm beam at 1/e^2 points.</p>
<p>Qty. of 1<br />Model #: FC3 <br />Description: One lot of Fiber Collimators, ~3mm aperture, fine 80 pitch adjustable collimation with locking feature to produce a ~1mm beam, wavefront error ~1/10 wave rms over 1/e^2 points,15 each with broadband AR coating from 350nm to 600nm and 15 each with broadband AR coating from 600nm to 1000nm.

<p>Micro Laser Systems, Inc.<br />12841 Western Ave. Suite H, Garden Grove, CA 92841<br />Phone: 1-714-898-6001</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement. It is essential to have a system that offers fine 80 pitch adjustable collimation with locking for the target beam diameters, broadband AR coating over the target range, wavefront error &lt;1/10 wave rms over 1/e^2 points, and FC/APC receptacle. Other manufactures are unable to meet this requirement without severely impacting or jeopardizing the success of ongoing research which would result in a loss of efficiency and the ability to experiment will be impaired</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>

(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.

<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.

<p>The CDC leases office space from DRA CRT Chamblee Center, LLC and the leased space has standalone HVAC equipment that requires preventative maintenance and repair. As the owner, Chamblee Center requires that repairs, maintenance, or alteration be performed by All Systems, Inc. because they were the contractor responsible for installation. As the owner of the leased property, Chamblee Center has the final say in which HVAC contractor's are acceptable and therefore, All Systems, Inc. is the sole source for this requirement.</p>

<CONTACT>Leslie D. Jones, Phone 7704882042, Email jxy6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), intends to award a sole source contract to the Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation (ANRF), 2530 San Pablo Ave, Ste J, Berkeley, CA 94702-2000 to provide OSH with ongoing data on several types of local tobacco control policies throughout the United States. This information will allow OSH to track national trends in these policies. This will allow OSH to monitor changes in these trends due to the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act and other developments, and to identify emerging patterns in local tobacco control policies. In addition, the information the contractor provides to OSH will allow OSH to monitor progress at the local level in protecting Americans from secondhand smoke and the proportion of Americans protected by state and local smoke-free laws over time. Finally, these data will be used for OSH to report on a number of national measures of health, such as its performance measures of the proportion of the U.S. population covered by smoke-free laws.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 813319, Other Social Advocacy Organizations. The period of performance for this procurement is 60 months.<br /><br />The Office on Smoking and Health has contracted with the Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation (ANRF) for the past 8 years to provide the Office of Smoking and Health (OSH) with data on national trends in the adoption of several types of local tobacco control policies. This information is important to OSH's ongoing surveillance of national, state, and local policy interventions to reduce tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure, as well as OSH's reporting requirements for program performance. Other organizations' tobacco control policy and legislative tracking efforts were considered, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the American Lung Association's State Legislative Actions on Tobacco Issues database. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids does acknowledge some local-level policy developments in their policy tracking, such as local excise taxes, but this tracking is not comprehensive. For instance, the Campaign only notes the highest local cigarette excise tax rates in the country as a way to illustrate the range in state-level excise tax rates, rather than collecting all local excise tax rates. Furthermore, although the State Legislative Actions on Tobacco Issues database contains some state-level data, it does not include local-level data. CDC's Office on Smoking and Health conducted market research and spoke with several subject matter experts with significant experience in tobacco control, and especially tobacco control policy and legal issues. They noted the importance of institutional knowledge and comprehensive, national coverage in tracking these laws. Specifically, OSH spoke with Michele Bloch at the National Cancer Institute, who noted that for smoke-free ordinance coverage, "the first (and usually the only) place that I go is the Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights website and database. There is no other organization that covers this area with the thoroughness, accuracy, authority, and timeliness that they do." We also spoke with Maggie Mahoney, former Director of the Tobacco Control Legal Consortium. She also noted that when they conduct national research, they turn to CDC's STATE System and the Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation Database.</p>
<p>The Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation is the only organization that currently tracks local tobacco control ordinances at the national level. No other organization tracks local tobacco control policy throughout the country, or has demonstrated the capacity to do so. Because of the complex issues and unique challenges involved, no other organization has demonstrated the capacity to track local tobacco control policy development, analysis, and tracking, its thorough grasp of the issues involved, and its extensive national network of contacts with local coalitions and advocates uniquely equip ANRF to play this role.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation (ANRF). However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2018-N-67816 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 6, 2018. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).&nbsp; THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.&nbsp; A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL WILL BE ISSUED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON OR ABOUT APRIL 9, 2018 IN DRAFT FORM.<br /><br />The Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health, intends to solicit proposals to award two Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to establish two Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) with management capabilities to support the original research projects conducted by its intramural investigators. This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE under the NAICS 541715. It is anticipated that the resultant contracts will be cost reimbursement contracts with a seven-year period of performance.<br /><br />The Division encompasses three branches: 1) Biostatistics &amp; Bioinformatics; 2) Epidemiology, and 3) Health Behavior Branch [https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/diphr/pages/about.aspx]. Central to the Division's mission is to design, implement, and conduct epidemiologic, biobehavioral and biostatistical research. This includes reproductive, perinatal and pediatric epidemiologic research, as well as research addressing gravid women, and child and adolescent health and health behaviors. Original biostatistical and bioinformatics methodology is developed based on analytic problems encountered in the design and/or conduct of the epidemiologic or biobehavioral research. As an intramural entity, the Division is charged with research aimed at filling critical data gaps within its mission by utilizing state-of-the-art methodologies and technologies. In addition, DIPHR investigators are charged with the timely communication of research findings to professional and lay audiences.<br /><br />DIPHR's research portfolio typically includes 6-10 concurrent major population health studies supported by a DCC through the task order mechanism on the Government fiscal year calendar. DIPHR investigators conduct epidemiologic and biobehavioral research within the following broad domains: etiologic and genetic (e.g., observational) research, clinical trials, complex survey(s) and behavioral studies. Studies involve collection of multiple data types including, for example, biospecimens (e.g., blood, serum, urine, placental tissue, fat tissue, hair samples, saliva), self-report data, electronic data (e.g., using fertility monitors, peak flow meters), imaging (e.g., x-rays, brain imaging, ultrasound images, operative photographs, video from camera-outfitted motor vehicles), wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers), and data collected via smartphones (e.g., ecologic momentary assessment). Sampling frameworks may include targeted clinics, research sites or geographic areas, and may include convenience and population-based sampling. Sampling may be on the individual, population or group level. Data collection often is multi-level, for example, 2-parent dyads, family-based dyads or triads, and classroom-based or school-based sampling units.<br /><br />The objectives of the proposed contracts are to provide requisite personnel, facilities and services to support all aspects of data collection, management and analysis of large (&gt;500 participants) multicenter population health studies. Major responsibilities of the DCCs will be to assure state-of-the-art data capture and quality, support data collection, tracking, analysis and storage, support all aspects of clinical trials (e.g., randomization, outcome tracking, compliance assessment, and independent monitoring by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)), and prepare and submit all necessary reports to DSMBs, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), regulatory agencies, and the NICHD data repository (DASH).<br /><br />DIPHR research focuses exclusively on human subjects research and, as such, the Offeror must have proven expertise in the preparation of study materials needed for obtaining (often multiple) institutional review boards, Office of Management &amp; Budget (OMB) applications, certificates of confidentiality, investigational new drug (IND) applications, and other necessary documentation. In addition, proven expertise in the development and maintenance of manual of procedures (MOP) is required. Changes to the MOP are expected to be documented in real time within the web based data management structure and to remain as a part of the official audit trail.<br /><br />Key personnel shall be designated specifically for each task and may include the Principal Investigator, Study Manager, Biostatistician, Web Programmer and/or Data Manager.<br /><br />The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about April 9, 2018 in draft form on FedBizOpps website: www.fbo.gov.  Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this presolicitation announcement. This acquisition has been designated as 100% Small Business Set-Aside under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541715.  Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted electronically to Theresa Koomson, Contracting Officer, at koomsont@mail.nih.gov, or Alice Pagan, Contracting Officer, at pagana@mail.nih.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  This is not an RFP and this announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, New Jersey, intends to issue a fixed-price five (5) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for the procurement of a minimum quantity of two (2) each, and a maximum quantity of twenty-five (25) each Oxygen Analyzers - OBIGGS Without Vacuum Pump (Part Number (P/N) 111B), on a sole source basis to Advanced Micro Instruments, Inc. (CAGE 1GKY2), of Huntington Beach, CA. This Oxygen Analyzer - OBIGGS Without Vacuum Pump is for the P-8A Poseidon Program for the United States Navy, Royal Australian Air Force, and Foreign Military Sales customers. The P-8A Aircraft has a requirement to analyze the oxygen level for a functional test of the Air Separation Module (ASM) without the Vacuum Pump. The Oxygen Analyzer is used to test the OBIGGS performance by measuring oxygen concentration. The Advanced Micro Instruments, Inc. Oxygen Analyzer, P/N 111B (National Stock Number 1660-01-592-6955), satisfies the unique P-8A requirement by analyzing the oxygen level for a functional test of the ASM without the Vacuum Pump. Advanced Micro Instruments, Inc., as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), is the developer, designer, and manufacturer of the Oxygen Analyzer, P/N 111B. Commercially available oxygen analyzers are not designed for aerospace applications, particularly to verify the operation of aircraft inerting systems. The Advanced Micro analyzer prevents flammable ignition, which is a critical safety feature and unique to the Advanced Micro Instruments P/N 111B. No other oxygen analyzer is known to possess this critical safety feature, as confirmed through market research, and can safely perform the P-8 oxygen level testing to meet aircraft requirements. Any other Oxygen Analyzer would have to undergo modification meet to the critical safety feature of the Advanced Micro analyzer and undergo extensive evaluation testing by the Government to determine if it could safely and satisfactorily analyze oxygen samples potentially containing flammable vapors. Under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 1901, the Government intends to issue a sole source contract to Advanced Micro Instruments, Inc. because this firm is considered the only responsible source capable of meeting the requirement. The Government does not own technical data or other specifications to permit full and open competition. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing that may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)
<p><strong>FA860118R0037SS.</strong></p>
<p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/ Operational Contacting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking capabilities packages of potential sources, including Small Business (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Women Owned (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned (EDWOSB), Veteran-Owned (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small businesses that are capable of providing <strong>Deployments/Distribution and Vehicle Management</strong> as defined in the attached Performance Work Statement. The 88th Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) is seeking a Firm-Fixed Priced contract (base year and four one-year options). Firms that respond shall specify that their services meet the specifications provided below and in attachments and provide detailed information to show clear technical compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Specifications are listed in the attachment identified below:</strong></p>
<p>1. Draft Performance Work Statement</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide the requested services to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is <strong>561210 (Facilities Support Services)</strong> with a size standard $38.5 Million. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard, and also indicate socio-economic status (SB, 8(a), VOSB, SDVOSB, WOSB, EDWOSB, and/or HUBZone). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Capability responses will be assessed and the data will be used to assist the Government in determining the acquisition strategy, including Small Business Set Aside (SBSA), sole source, or full and open, for any potential subsequent action. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.001, market research results will be used to determine whether FAR Part 19 criteria are met for a SBSA or further socio-economic set aside. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a SBSA is that small business prime contractors meet the requirements set forth in compliance with FAR 52.219-14, Limitation of Subcontract. Responses from small businesses, therefore, need to include rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 will be achieved. Also, the rules governing affiliation and ostensible subcontracting apply when determining size, as does the non-manufacturer rule. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to</p>
<p>this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE: All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements as stated in Attachment 1 hereto. Please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1) Does prospective contractor have direct and relevant Air Force Deployment/Distribution Services and Vehicle Management experience?</p>
<p>a. Demonstrate recent application and successful accomplishment of major disciplines to include Air Force Surface and Air Freight, Planning and Packaging Operations, Small Air Terminal Operations, Passenger Travel, Personal Property, Vehicle Operations, and Vehicle Management.</p>
<p>2) Does prospective contractor have management team meeting/exceeding minimum requirements listed within the Performance Work Statement?</p>
<p>a. Demonstrate corporate strategy to ensure only qualified personnel are placed to execute each discipline, to include a mitigation plan to fill vacant positions if needed.</p>
<p>b. Each position requires verifiable evidence of successful experience in both listed minimum years and discipline.</p>
<p>3) Prospective contractor must convey commitment to internal quality assurance oversight.</p>
<p>a. Demonstrate corporate level oversight to ensure local quality assurance, training, safety and environmental programs/processes are continually executed to corporate expectations.</p>
<p>b. Demonstrate culture of individual problem solvers and internal mitigation plans not reliant on government direction/oversight.</p>

<p>The solicitation will require that offerors submit sample ear tags, applicators and supporting data in order to evaluate the tags. Tags will be evaluated for durability, retention, tag closure, ease of application, legibility, injury to the ear, and absence of toxic or irritating substances in the composition of the tags.

Data meeting the following requirements is desirable for evaluating tag retention, durability and legibility:<br />- At least 100 lambs and/or kids tagged at 8 weeks or less of age with the test tag and the current metal tag provided free by APHIS in the opposite ear should be evaluated for at least 90 days after application.<br />- An accredited veterinarian or other third party acceptable to APHIS should observe the application of the tags with the type of applicator that will be provided for use with the tags in the bid. The third party should record the type of tags and applicator used, the ages and types of animals used, the numbers on the tags applied to each animal, and any problems with the application of the tags including any difficulties in applying the tags such as failure to properly close or breakage, using the applicator such as breakage, the tag falling out of the applicator, strength required to apply the tag relative to the current contract metal tag applicator or if there is an unusual amount of discomfort to the animal during or after application.<br />- The accredited veterinarian or other third party acceptable to APHIS should observe the tags at least 90 days after application and record any tags that are lost or damaged, the number of ears disfigured or infected and the<br />severity, the legibility of the tags including fading, and any other issues observed that may affect the utility of the tags or applicator.<br />- This data must be provided with the application and must be signed by the accredited veterinarian or other acceptable third party.<br /><br />If such data is not available other types of retention data and/or evidence of long term successful use in sheep/goats may be considered in evaluating retention; however, to be considered responsive it must provide evidence of an acceptable level of retention as determined by APHIS.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals, but instead market research to determine interested vendors prior to issuing a solicitation. A determination by the Government on the method of competing this requirement has not been established. The Government will not award a contract based on this Sources Sought Notice or the information received, nor will it reimburse participants for the information they provide.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. <br /><br />The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), is seeking information on a potential requirement for "Dose Reconstruction and Related Activities for Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA)."<br /><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the interest, availability, and capability of qualified small and "other than small" business sources; (2) if a small business then the type; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) a businesses' size classification relative to the NAICS code 541990 for the potential acquisition. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draft Sample Performance Based Work Statement;<br /><br />Dose Reconstruction and Related Activities to Support NIOSH's Responsibilities under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act (EEOICPA).</span>
<p>1. Introduction/Background. <br /><br />The objective of this acquisition is to allow National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), through its Division of Compensation Analysis and Support (DCAS), to fulfill its obligations under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act (EEOICPA), performing dose reconstructions for claims referred by DOL (Department of Labor) and evaluating petitions for additions of classes to the SEC (Special Exposure Cohort). More specifically, the objectives are to obtain assistance in performing the following activities:<br />&bull; Identify data relevant to reconstructing radiation doses and evaluating SEC petitions<br />&bull; Claimant Communications<br />&bull; Dose estimation and reporting<br />&bull; Prepare Special Exposure Cohort petition evaluations<br />&bull; Technical and program management support<br /><br />2. References. <br /><br />Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Radiation Dose Reconstruction website: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/default.html<br />The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA or The Act), as Amended, established a compensation program for the civilian men and women who, over the past 50 years, have performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear weapons production and testing programs of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies. http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/theact/eeoicpaall.pdf</p>
<p>The Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) was originally passed on October 30, 2000, and became effective on July 31, 2001. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107; Section 3151(b)) and the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (Public Law 108-375; Section 3161) made several amendments to The Act<br />Other references can be located on the Web such as 42 CFR 81 (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/42cfr81/frcll020612.pdf), 42 CFR 82 (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/42cfr82/42cfr82.pdf), and 42 CFR 83 (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/42cfr83/42cfr83b.pdf).<br /><br />3. Scope and Requirements: <br /><br />The support services that the dose reconstruction contractor will be expected to provide are listed below. It is expected that this level of support will be required during the base year and during each option year. While the number of cases to be processed on an annual basis is subject to fluctuation, offerors should prepare their proposals assuming that 3,320 dose reconstructions will be required each year (64 per week for 52 weeks). Additionally, the contractor will be required to review previously completed dose reconstruction reports to determine if changes made in methodology or new data affects the outcome of the case. These reviews do not require a fully documented dose reconstruction unless the claim's compensability decision is likely to switch from non-compensable to compensable. It should be assumed that a weekly average of approximately 25 such evaluations need to be completed. It should be understood that this is not a guarantee of this level of effort, but a target value that will facilitate comparison of proposals. Offerors should assume that, for each year of the contract, 5 SEC petitions will be filed, and claims will be received from 5 sites with no claims previously submitted. Site research will be required for those situations. Technical approaches and some calculational tools from sites that have been researched prior to this award will be made available to the successful offeror by NIOSH. <br /><br />All documents that describe radiation exposures, radiological operations, radiological conditions, and other information useful to performing dose reconstruction, evaluating SEC petitions, or performing other functions of the project will be stored in the SRD. The SRD contains documents that relate to U.S. DOE and AWE sites. These documents can include, but are not limited to, general overview documents, publications for a site that describe a particular process or operation, or reports from a site addressing particular issues such as specific contaminants to which some workers might have been exposed. Project personnel populate and use the database to develop and write TBDs and TIBs, as well as to perform dose reconstructions. <br /><br />Information relevant to individual claims will be stored in the NIOSH OCAS Claims Tracking System (NOCTS). NOCTS was developed to track the claims made under EEOICPA. The NOCTS application tracks claimant data and documents, and is thus a central repository for all information related to each claim. The web-based interface allows the application to be accessed by any computer equipped with Internet connection and browser software. The primary goal of NOCTS is to facilitate the processing of claims in an efficient and accurate manner. The application also provides an instrument for effective and timely communications with claimants during this process. Another goal is to establish and maintain interagency communications among all the parties involved in the claims process. <br />1.0 Identify data relevant to reconstructing radiation doses and evaluating SEC petitions <br /><br />1.1 Data collection related to claims and petitions: The contractor will collect all known sources of recorded dosimetry, radiation data, and relevant information applicable to completing dose reconstructions for individual claimants and evaluating SEC petitions from classes of employees. This task will include the following: <br /><br />1.1.1 NIOSH will request from DOE and provide to the contractor individual exposure information for claimants. In coordination with NIOSH and with the cooperation of DOE, the contractor will request from DOE (as necessary) and other entities supplemental information applicable to individual claims or petitions to supplement any such information in the NIOSH claims database. The collection of this information will be conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding that has been established between HHS and DOE (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/ocasdoe.html#mou or <br />http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/misc/moudoe.pdf). <br /><br />1.1.2 The contractor will synthesize information related to dose reconstruction feasibility into Professional Judgment Papers and Petition Evaluation Reports, providing the basis for the feasibility or infeasibility of constructing radiation dose. Professional Judgment Papers evaluate the bases provided with the SEC petition to determine if they meet the criteria in 42 CFR 83 for a valid petition, i.e. to determine if the petition qualifies. Petition Evaluation Reports are prepared once petitions are qualified and they evaluate the existing information to determine if it is sufficient to perform dose reconstructions for the proposed class. Additional information about the SEC process and examples of Petition Evaluation Reports can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/ocassec.html.<br /><br />1.1.3 The contractor will maintain a local office in Cincinnati, Ohio to abstract, enter, or migrate necessary information from DOE and other records into the Site Research Database or NIOSH OCAS Claims Tracking System for use in dose reconstructions or other purposes. <br /><br />1.1.4 The contractor will monitor the completeness and timeliness of record/information acquisition from DOE and other sources, inform NIOSH, on a monthly basis, of delays, their causes, and involve NIOSH as necessary to obtain their timely resolution. <br /><br />1.2 Dose reconstruction research: The contractor will research the conditions, processes, practices, and incidents at DOE and AWE facilities relevant to conducting dose reconstructions. This task will include the following: <br /><br />1.2.1 The contractor will review and analyze records from DOE and AWEs, which will be useful to interpret recorded dosimetry information, to evaluate the adequacy and completeness of dosimetry information, and to substitute for unavailable or incomplete dosimetry information. Plans for site visits and the research to be performed during a site visit must be approved by NIOSH. It is likely that 50 site data capture visits may be required each year. <br /><br />1.2.2 With the cooperation of DOE and assistance of worker representatives and others, the contractor will identify and interview current and former DOE/AWE facility line managers, radiation protection personnel, individual workers, and others as appropriate, and analyze the results of these interviews to interpret recorded dosimetry information, to evaluate the adequacy and completeness of dosimetry information, and to substitute for unavailable or incomplete dosimetry information. The extent of these efforts shall be coordinated with and approved by NIOSH prior to initiation of contact with DOE or DOE contractor personnel. <br /><br />1.2.3 As agreed upon between NIOSH and the contractor, the contractor will develop statistical procedures and assumptions based on dose reconstruction research that can be applied in multiple dose reconstructions, including but not limited to dose reconstructions for employees in specific jobs, performing specific tasks, employed in specific facilities or sites, and related to specific time periods of employment. These statistical procedures will include methods to estimate the uncertainty distributions surrounding internal and external dose reconstructions on a facility specific and time-dependent basis. NIOSH will review and approve such procedures and assumptions. Technical information bulletins ORAUT-OTIB-0019 Rev-01, "Analysis of Coworker Bioassay Data for Internal Dose Assignment," and ORAUT-OTIB--0020 Re-03, "Use of Coworker Dosimetry Date for External Dose Assignment," describe these techniques (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/tibsnum.html). <br /><br />1.2.4 The contractor will produce and submit to NIOSH reports summarizing methods, data sources, and findings of research on facilities on a schedule specified by NIOSH as the need for the report is identified. <br /><br />1.2.5 The contractor will research and analyze information pertaining to sites, claims, and dose reconstruction processes in response to questions and technical issues raised about the EEOICPA program by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health. Results of these efforts will be provided as scheduled by NIOSH. <br /><br />2.0 Claimant Communications<br /><br />2.1 As directed under 42 CFR 82 and consistent with NIOSH technical guides and procedures, conduct, record, transmit to NIOSH, and report to claimants the results of computer assisted telephone interviews (CATIs) with claimants and, as appropriate, with co-workers and other potential witnesses. Three scripts that cover interviews with claimants who are covered employees, survivors, or co-workers have been prepared. They are provided in Attachment C. Since these scripts have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, any substantive changes will require approval by OMB. NIOSH will provide a usable computerized version of these scripts. The contractor may, however, with review and approval from NIOSH, convert these scripts to a computer program that facilitates more efficient data storage and retrieval. <br /><br />2.2 The contractor will produce and provide for review by the claimant/interviewee reports of interviews, and enter final reports and their elements as a case file into the claims database no less frequently than weekly. <br /><br />2.3 The contractor will obtain and enter into the claimant interview case file and research database additional information as may be provided by the claimant in writing to supplement the claim record. <br /><br />2.4 The contractor will conduct close-out interviews with claimants once they have received their draft dose reconstruction reports in order to answer questions about the dose reconstruction and to explain the next steps in the claim process. <br /><br />2.5 Although not part of the interview process, the contractor must provide a toll free telephone line to address claimants' questions within 30 days of award. This will be in addition to the claimant telephone support service that NIOSH is currently offering.<br />&nbsp;<br />2.6 The contractor will correspond with claimants informing them that their dose reconstruction has been scheduled once all the information necessary to perform the dose reconstruction has been received, but not before. <br /><br />2.7 The contractor will designate a point of contact within its organization who is responsible for resolving issues and answering questions from communications with claimants by either NIOSH or the contractor. This point of contact shall have the organizational authority necessary to resolve issues between sub-organizations within the contractor's organization in order to provide resolutions and answers. <br /><br />2.8 When the contractor receives information from a claimant that affects the normal progress of the claim (e.g., identifies an additional cancer not listed on the claim, provides information that affects the draft dose reconstruction, etc.) the contractor shall notify NIOSH's Claimant Information and Communication Team of the reason for the interruption in claim progress. Information of this nature that is received by NIOSH will be communicated promptly to the contractor. In all cases the contractor will communicate the resolution to the claimant. <br /><br />2.9 Contractor shall provide CATI and close out interview for every claimant for whom a dose reconstruction is performed unless claimant declines to participate. Some claims have multiple claimants, so the number of claimants is larger than the number of dose reconstructions that must be completed. Contractor should plan to complete 1.5 CATIs and close out interviews per dose reconstruction, or 96 CATIs and close out interviews per week.<br /><br />3.0 Dose Estimation and reporting<br /><br />3.1 As directed under 42 CFR Part 82 and consistent with NIOSH Implementation Guides for Internal and External Dose Reconstruction (located at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/ocasdose.html#process), and technical information bulletins and procedures (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/ocastbds.html ,<br />http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/ocasppg.html ), the contractor will produce and report timely dose estimates, supporting methodology, and factual basis for each claim received by NIOSH from DOL under EEOICPA and for claims requiring re-work because of changes in claim information or changes in dose reconstruction policy (estimated at 3000 dose reconstructions and re-works annually). <br /><br />3.2 The contractor will collect and analyze all available information relevant to dose estimation/reconstruction for each individual claim and produce and transmit to NIOSH a draft report providing dose estimates, methods, and the factual basis upon which the doses were estimated, including a narrative explanation of this information understandable by claimants with a high school education. An example dose reconstruction report will be included as an attachment under Section J. <br /><br />3.2.1 Internal and external radiation dose estimates will be calculated for each organ that the claimant presents with a primary cancer. The annual dose to each organ will be calculated from the time of first exposure at a covered facility to the date of cancer diagnosis. As appropriate, a separate dose will be computed for each type of radiation exposure received by the individual, using the exposure types provide for in the NIOSH-Interactive Radio Epidemiological Program (IREP) program. These doses will be reported as equivalent dose using the weighting factors provided in the NIOSH technical guides. As part of NIOSH's ongoing Quality Assurance (QA) program, the contractor may be provided blind test claims on a periodic basis. <br /><br />3.2.2 Internal dose calculations will be performed using standard metabolic models published by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These calculations will be performed using a NIOSH supplied computer program entitled Integrated Module for Bioassay Analysis (IMBA) or other NIOSH approved programs. IMBA was specially created for NIOSH to perform internal dose calculations using the most recent physiologically based biokinetic models such as those contained in ICRP publications 56, 67, and 69. Inhalation intakes will be evaluated using the respiratory tract model contained in ICRP publication 66. The contractor will not have access to the source code. Any contractor developed software used for calculating internal dose must be approved by NIOSH prior to its use in dose reconstructions and NIOSH must have access to the program and source code. Any contractor purchased software used for calculating internal dose must be approved by NIOSH prior to its use in dose reconstructions. <br /><br />Within 30 days of award, NIOSH will provide training on the IMBA software for key contractor personnel who are not familiar with the software. Within 30 days after receiving training from NIOSH, the contractor will be responsible for providing and documenting training to members of its technical team who will be involved in conducting dose reconstructions and are not already familiar with the software. <br /><br />3.2.3 Estimates of missed dose, due to technical limitations in monitoring technology, will be evaluated and included in the claimant's dose reconstruction for both internal and external sources of exposure. In addition, any exposure to diagnostic x-rays that were required as a condition of employment and that were performed at an EEOICPA-covered facility will be estimated and included in the claimant's total organ dose. <br /><br />3.3 The contractor will review with NIOSH and revise dose reconstructions, as necessary, subject to NIOSH oversight of the dose reconstruction program. <br /><br />3.4 The contractor will develop statistical procedures and assumptions that may have application for multiple dose reconstructions, including but not limited to dose reconstructions for employees in specific jobs, performing specific tasks, employed in specific facilities or sites, and related to specific time periods of employment. NIOSH will review and approve these procedures and assumptions before they are used to complete dose reconstructions. <br /><br />4.0 Prepare Special Exposure Cohort petition evaluations <br /><br />4.1 In accordance with 42 CFR 83 and procedure OCAS-PR-004, "Internal Procedures for the Evaluation of Special Exposure Cohort Petitions," <br />(http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/secmisc.html) the contractor will process and evaluate petitions received from individuals for the addition of classes to the SEC, and will initiate the addition of classes when there is not adequate information to reconstruct radiation doses with sufficient accuracy. <br /><br />4.2 The contractor will process and evaluate petitions received from individuals for additions of classes to the SEC (the 83.13 process).<br /><br />4.2.1 With the approval of NIOSH, the contractor will communicate with the petition submitter as necessary in order to obtain the information required in 42 CFR 83 for a petition. Some petitions may be sufficient upon initial receipt, but NIOSH expects that every petition will require communication of this type to obtain information required by 42 CFR 83. <br /><br />4.2.2 The contractor will determine whether the information ultimately submitted with a petition meets the requirements in 42 CFR 83 and therefore qualifies for evaluation. Contractor will document the basis for this determination in a professional judgment and submit it to NIOSH.<br /><br />4.2.3 For petitions that qualify for evaluation, the contractor shall provide a list of the types of apparent data deficiencies that could potentially make dose reconstructions infeasible, along with the research efforts that the contractor will pursue to remedy each apparent data deficiency, and shall submit the list to NIOSH for review and approval. The schedule for delivering the list will be established by NIOSH upon qualification of a petition, depending on the complexity of the petition. <br /><br />4.2.4 The contractor shall research information relevant to the feasibility of the dose reconstruction for members of the class; reach determinations about the feasibility of reconstructing doses for members of the class and the potential that members of the class were harmed by their exposure; document those determinations in a petition evaluation report; and submit the petition evaluation report to NIOSH for review and approval. The petition evaluation report must be completed and approved by NIOSH within 180 days from the date the petition was originally submitted to NIOSH, not counting days when NIOSH and the contractor are awaiting additional information from the submitter in order to fulfill the petition qualification requirements of 42 CFR 83. <br /><br />4.2.5 The contractor will provide additional research and revision to petition evaluation reports to respond to questions raised by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health ("the Board"). NIOSH anticipates that every petition evaluation report will prompt questions from the Board. Such questions have required detailed follow-up analysis of complex issues such as monitoring program adequacy, technical performance of internal and external dosimetry systems, and characterization of the radiation fields present at sites being evaluated. <br /><br />4.3 The contractor will identify classes of workers for whom there is inadequate information to perform dose reconstruction with sufficient accuracy, and initiate adding those classes to the SEC (the 83.14 process). <br /><br />4.3.1 The contractor will identify potential classes for whom dose reconstruction is not feasible, and will document the basis for that determination. Classes may comprise any portion of the employees at a covered facility and any portion of the duration of the covered period. The class definition and basis for finding it infeasible to reconstruct radiation doses will be submitted to NIOSH for review and approval.<br /><br />4.3.2 The contractor will propose a representative claimant from each 83.14 class for NIOSH approval. Upon NIOSH approval of a representative claimant, contractor will prepare communications to that claimant about the infeasibility of dose reconstruction and the 83.14 SEC process. <br /><br />4.3.3 The contractor will prepare a petition evaluation report that documents the basis for finding dose reconstruction infeasible for members of the class and submit the petition evaluation report to NIOSH for review and approval.<br />4.3.4 The contractor will provide additional research and revision to petition evaluation reports to respond to questions raised by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health. NIOSH expects that every petition evaluation report will prompt questions from the Board. <br /><br />5.0 Technical and program management support <br /><br />5.1 Technical support: Provide information and analyses to NIOSH to review individual dose reconstructions, dose reconstruction procedures and practices, or SEC petition evaluations, or to respond to requests by DOL, the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, Congress, or other stakeholders, and to support NIOSH management in the dose reconstruction and SEC petition evaluation program. This task will include the following: <br /><br />5.1.1 The contractor will prepare and provide analyses, information and reports to NIOSH in response to reviews of individual dose reconstructions requested by DOL in the adjudication of claims. NIOSH expects four of these requests per year.<br /><br />5.1.2 The contractor will prepare and provide analyses, information, and reports to NIOSH in response to reviews of dose reconstructions, dose reconstruction procedures, technical documents such as technical information bulletins or technical basis documents, or SEC petition evaluations under EEOICPA by the Advisory Board and other external organizations that may conduct scientific or technical reviews, such as the National Academy of Sciences and the Government Accountability Office. NIOSH expects that the Advisory Board will review and comment on 60 dose reconstruction reports, 8 technical basis documents, and 15 procedures and technical information bulletins (combined) each year. Total requests from other bodies is expected to be four per year. <br /><br />5.1.3 The contractor will prepare and provide analyses, information, and reports to NIOSH in support of Congressional briefings and in response to Congressional inquiries. NIOSH expects to request contractor assistance for responding to one Congressional inquiry per week and six briefings per year. Inquiries address individual cases, while briefings address program status and site specific information for a single or few sites (e.g., those from a single state). <br /><br />5.1.4 Within 30 days of award, the contractor will establish practices for using the NIOSH OCAS Claims Tracking System (NOCTS). Any supplementary tracking system established by the contractor must be compatible with and provide current information to NOCTS to support reporting of dose reconstruction process status to claimants. <br /><br />5.1.5 The contractor will provide records to NIOSH such that NIOSH can comply with requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act. NIOSH expects to request contractor assistance in approximately twelve such requests per year.<br /><br />5.2 Program management support: The contractor shall provide comprehensive program management support to NIOSH. This task will include the following: <br /><br />5.2.1 Within 60 days of award, the contractor will develop and implement a written project management plan and submit it to NIOSH for review and approval. The project management plan will define the organizational structure, management approach, requirements, and tools for planning, implementing, and monitoring work practices which will be used to complete radiation dose reconstructions and to evaluate submissions and petitions for the addition of classes to the SEC.<br /><br />5.2.2 Within 90 days of award, the contractor will develop, implement and maintain a written quality assurance program for the overall project. The quality assurance program documentation will describe the organizational structure, functional responsibilities, levels of authority, and interfaces for those personnel managing, <br />performing, and assessing the adequacy of work performed as part of this contract.<br /><br />5.2.3 Within 90 days of award, the contractor will develop and enact procedures for implementing "NIOSH Policy on the Appearance of Bias for the EEOICPA Program &amp; General Conflict of Interest Requirements,"(http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/ocascobs.html or <br />http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/dr/aobplcy-v2.pdf). Copies of those procedures will be provided to NIOSH at that time.</p>
<p>5.2.4 The contractor will prepare and submit to NIOSH monthly performance reports and quarterly cost reports covering all tasks under this contract. The monthly performance report shall include but need not be limited to: the number of dose reconstruction reports submitted to NIOSH for approval; a list of the procedures, technical information bulletins, technical basis documents, or other documents submitted to NIOSH for approval; A list of SEC professional judgment papers and petition evaluation reports submitted to NIOSH for approval; any other products delivered; a status report of information gathering efforts (those completed, underway, and planned), to include document capture efforts, site visits, worker and site expert interviews; a description of issues that must be addressed in order to complete required activities; and a description of the work accomplished and work in progress under the contract.<br /><br />5.2.5 The contractor will participate in person or by teleconference in project status meetings with DCAS and other topical meetings convened by DCAS.

<DESC>CA-KBNWRC-TID WATER DELIVERIES;Refuge wetlands and farms fields can only be filled using TIDs infrastructure. No other conveyance infrastructure exists to move water from the Tule Lake Sump to wetland or farm units. The costs of wheeling this water is $100/acre and the Refuge will flood approximately 220 acres in 2018. These costs are used to cover the operation and maintenance of TIDs infrastructure (canals, pumps, headgates, etc.). This includes ditch cleaning, pump and headgate servicing, and electrical costs associated with pump operation. If you feel you can provide this service without the use of TID please contact me via email no later than 2:00 p.m., March 30th, 2018. Farrell_cross@fws.gov.

<DESC>This Sources Sought is for additional repairs needed to Beach Hall (Building 291).  The requirement is based on a survey previously conducted that identified an unstable parapet wall as a potential life safety hazard and source of water intrusion.  The survey was performed under a previously awarded contract.   The additional repairs discovered directly affect the ability to perform the work under the aforementioned contract which is currently under a suspension of work.  The scope of work includes deconstructing the existing parapet wall around the high roof.  While deconstructing the existing parapet, care should be taken to save as much of the existing brick as possible for use in the reconstruction of the parapet wall.
  The new parapet wall is to be a solid reinforced masonry wall with face brick on the exterior and reinforced CMU block on the interior side.  Collar joint between the CMU and brick is to be grouted solid.  Roof repairs including replacement of flashing plies where the roof meets the parapet wall will be required around the majority of the perimeter.  Contractors must be able to complete the contract work within 180 days.

<CONTACT>Brian D Serra, Agreements Officer, Phone 407-208-3357, Email brian.d.serra.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Request for Solutions:<br />Air Defense Artillery Long-Term Evolution Orientation Device<br /><br />1. Purpose<br /></strong>This Request for Solutions is issued to identify a unique solution for an Air Defense Artillery Long-Term Evolution Orientation Device. The Government will evaluate the solutions with the intent of negotiating an Other Transaction Agreement under the Training and Readiness Accelerator (TReX).<br /><br /><strong>2. Summary and Background<br /></strong>The U.S. Army desires a Long-Term Evolution (LTE)-based device to provide real-time orientation and positioning status to support air defense simulated engagements during live force-on-force training exercises.<br /><br />Currently, Army Combat Training Centers (CTC) use laser based systems to replicate direct fire engagements. Laser based systems have limitations when targets do not have the ability to utilize Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) detectors, such as United States Airforce (USAF) aircraft, Army aviation helicopters or Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) platforms. Many of the Air Defense Artillery (ADA) engagements (such as missiles) can be stimulated if both the target location and a reasonable weapon orientation at the time of engagement is known. Two CTCs (the National Training Center (NTC) and Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC)) have or soon will have an LTE-based instrumentation network. The LTE network will allow the integration of commercial items, such as devices that provide orientation. This project will develop (if possible and reasonable) a prototype providing a weapon orientation device that will communicate across the existing CTC LTE network. This device will enhance pilot, ADA and Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) training at the CTCs.<br /><br />The Combat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) Program fielded capabilities for the CTCs at the NTC at Fort Irwin, California; the JRTC at Fort Polk, Louisiana. CTC-IS is an integrated system of computer software and hardware; workstations; databases; voice, video, and data recording, production, and presentation equipment; interface devices; and communication networks. It provides the tools for the Combat Trainer and the Training Analysts to collect, analyze, and present training performance feedback to the training unit in the After Action Review.<br /><br /><strong>The full RFS and Technical Supplement can be viewed on the TReX website, located at the following link: <a href="https://trainingaccelerator.org/2018/03/air-defense-artillery-long-term-evolution-orientation-device/">https://trainingaccelerator.org/2018/03/air-defense-artillery-long-term-evolution-orientation-device/</a> </strong><a href="https://trainingaccelerator.org/system-of-systems-controlled-environment-test-infrastructure-sceti/"></a></p>

<DESC><strong>This is a DRAFT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL notice, please do not send a proposal in response to this posting</strong>. The U.S. Army Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Hood (MICC-Fort Hood), on behalf of Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona has a requirement to provide non-personal services for the primary mission of the Tropic Regions Test Center TRTC which is to plan and conduct tropic environmental testing on a wide variety of military electronic systems, materials, weapons, and equipment of all conceivable types, sizes, configurations and uses. The unique combination of tropic microclimates available at test sites means the individual needs of each customer shall be flexibly met and programs are conducted at locations appropriate for each test where conditions are realistic and test requirements are met. The primary mission of the TRTC is to plan and conduct tropic environmental testing on a wide variety of military electronic systems, materials, weapons, and equipment of all conceivable types, sizes, configurations and uses. The unique combination of tropic microclimates available at test sites means the individual needs of each customer are flexibly met. Programs are conducted at locations appropriate for each test (see paragraph 1.6.5); where conditions are realistic and test requirements are met. Recognized as a premier Army asset, TRTC's capabilities continue to expand, thereby increasing the need for permanent on-site personnel to support the testing created by those capabilities. The functional areas for which contract support is required are defined in Part 5.
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract. The period of performance (PoP) for the requirement is a 90-day phase-in period, a 12-month base period, and four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>As part of this notice, the Government is providing a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for industry comment. The Government is seeking feedback from industry on all parts of this draft RFP. The cutoff date for industry comments is November 14 at 12:00 p.m. CST.</p>
<p>Feedback in response to the draft RFP shall be submitted by email using the subject line "TROPICS Draft RFP Feedback". Each subject shall reference the specific RFP Section in questions or comments. All questions shall be emailed to Belinda Woods (belinda.woods.civ@mail.mil) and Angela Morin (angela.l.morin.civ@mail.mil).</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to provide individual responses to feedback received in response to the draft RFP. A final RFP will be issued 30 NOV 2017.</p>

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)<br />Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>
<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com.<br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care.<br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent for DTMO/Program Management Support Services
<p><br />The Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA)/Contracting Directorate (PK) intends to extend current contract H98210-17-F-0005 with NTT DATA Services Federal Government, Inc. (NTT Data) at the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO), Mark Center, Alexandria, Virginia. The current contract with NTT Data ends 4 April 2018, and is anticipated to be extended for up to three (3) months and one (1) day, from 5 April 2018, through 5 July 2018. This proposed extension will enable DHRA to continue critical requirements for DTMO Program Support Services at the Mark Center while DHRA/PK supports the Government Accountability Office protest process.</p>
<p><br />The proposed extension is based upon the exclusion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 and 41 United States Code 3304(a)(1), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the limited time frame. To DHRA's knowledge, only NTT Data has the requisite knowledge, experience and capability to provide these critical services without interruption during the acquisition cycle for transition to a new contract. Essentially, NTT Data is the only company qualified to show a new contractor the current operational considerations of DTMO's Program Support requirement.</p>
<p>THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested, responsible sources may submit information about their capability to perform this requirement, which shall be considered by the agency. Capability statements must be received by the response date and time of this notice. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS

Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) intends to award a sole-source contract to Northeastern Trawl (NET) Systems. The procurement is for a midwater trawl, trawl rigging, and trawl doors that must be sized to match the trawl winches and net reel on a current vessel the Service already has in their fleet.  Since net design can have a substantial impact on the retention of specimens in the trawl (both by species and size), trawl standardization is fundamental to ensuring comparable trawl catches and is a priority for our assessment program.  NET Systems designed and built the midwater trawl net currently in use on the current vessel and their proprietary design has already been completed and is being utilized by the Service.  Furthermore, the trawl doors are matched to the engineered net design to ensure net functionality. The Service needs to ensure that the gear conforms to the current vessels system constraints, and to provide standardization across vessel platforms.  Classification System (NAICS) is 333618, Other Engine Equipment Manufacturing. This is not a solicitation for quotations, but rather a notice of the Services intent to make a sole-source award to NET Systems.  There will be no solicitation issued or available. This notice is for information only. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. THIS NOTICE DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. You may email questions regarding this notice to the issuing office at:  tiffany_breske@fws.gov

<DESC><strong>Synopsis: <br /></strong><br />NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.<br /></strong><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: <br /></strong><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a novel instrument to measure low levels of contamination on curved or irregular shaped surfaces. The instrument offers multiple unique capabilities such as the ability to identify and quantify contamination and analyze multiple surfaces simultaneously. This information provides an analysis of surface cleanliness needed for more reliable adhesive bonding in applications such as light weight aircraft.  The instrument directs UV radiation onto a surface, which produces a small electric current. The instrument then measures that current as it changes over a small time interval. By analyzing the current, the level of contamination on the surface and the identification of the contaminant species can be determined. This system enables real-time identification and quantification of contaminants, even on multiple irregularly shaped surfaces simultaneously.  It has possible applications in manufacturing processes where two surfaces are adhesively bonded, in semiconductor manufacturing, in aircraft manufacturing, and in automotive manufacturing. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.<br /><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company.  Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA Langley-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Langley's Technology Gateway at https://technologygateway.nasa.gov/<br /><br />These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley's Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development "OSACB" for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice. </strong><br />

<DESC><strong>Synopsis: </strong><br /><br />NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.<br /></strong><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong><br /><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a new solid state integrated circuit based on field effect transistor (FET). Called ergFET, the sensor characterizes the electronic properties of materials, allowing for imaging of items like baggage, wiring, liquids, and can even be used for medical imaging such as remote electrocardiogram. This equilibrium-reversing-gate field effect transistor (ergFET) deploys an electrode near the gate of the transistor to control and reverse leakage currents which are typical in transistors and can lead to measurement errors. It can be built into an array to enable higher resolution imaging and is a solid state device free of moving parts. This enables portable and hand held sensor designs. Benefits include high sensitivity, improved resolution, portability, and improved robustness from solid state parts.  Applications may include security screening, medical imaging, non-destructive testing, intrusion detection, forensics, combustion science, sensor design, and electrostatic discharge (ESD) mitigation. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.

<CONTACT>Pinney, Heather
<DESC>Purchase of the Labcyte Gold Service Plan, part number LSA-550 Gold, 1-year (12 month) preventive maintenance and service plan
Governments Notice of Intent to Sole Source:
NAICS Code: 811219 Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance.  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with 
Labcyte Inc. (Labcyte), 170 Rose Orchard Way, San Jose, CA 95134-1374, a firm fixed-price purchase order under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) for the purchase of a 1-year (12-month) preventive maintenance service plan (maintenance plan), Base Period + Two 12-month Periods of Performance, for the EPAs Labcyte Echo 550 Acoustic Liquid Handler (Echo 550) located at the EPAs Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT), Immediate Office (IO), Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC.

The Echo 550 instrument is a mission-critical piece of laboratory equipment, utilized daily by NCCT scientists for a variety of different assays, protocols and projects.  The hardware, firmware and software associated with the Echo 550, solely manufactured by Labcyte, uses technology that is proprietary to Labcyte.  Labcyte service technicians are certified Labcyte factory trained technicians and possess proprietary knowledge and skills pertaining to the Echo 550 which is only available to Labcyte service technicians.  Replacement parts, instrument certification, instrument and software fixes and upgrades are proprietary to Labcyte.  Due to the proprietary nature of the Echo 550, maintenance and service performed on the Echo 550 by a technician other than a Labcyte certified technician will void all existing warranties and certifications.  There are other vendors who can provide/sell a maintenance and service plan (outside plan) for the Echo 550; however, the issue remains one of instrument certification and timeliness.  Outside plans are forwarded to Labcyte for execution by a Labcyte certified technician.  Outside plans are provided a lower priority status and queued behind Labcyte-issued maintenance plans, thus running the risk of the inability to use the instrument due to a loss of certification or operability.  In the event of a lapse in continuity of maintenance and service plans, the instrument would not be certified for use and would need to be re-certified at a significant cost to the Government.  Any disruption in service would negatively impact multiple on-going projects resulting in unacceptable delays, loss of experimental continuity and potential loss of time-sensitive experimental material.  For these reasons, the maintenance and servicing of the Echo 550 by another organization is not feasible.  This purchase order is therefore being directed, without competition, to Labcyte. The circumstances permitting Other than Full and Open Competition at this time is FAR 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.

The intent of this notice is to state the Governments intention to sole source this acquisition and to determine if any other source(s) exist. Therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required service should 1) fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing and submit same via FedConnect, a government web portal, within 5 days from the date of this announcement; and 2) must submit itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  

Consequently, any responder(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Offerors must submit all technical questions / responses concerning this synopsis electronically through FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/.  This notice and any amendments will be available via the Internet at www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ .  You must register with FedConnect as an interested party to submit questions and to view responses.  Vendors can register with FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/. For assistance in registering or for other FedConnect technical questions please call the FedConnect Help Desk at (800) 899-6665 or email at support@fedconnect.net. FedConnect is a web portal that connects agencies and vendors to streamline the process of doing business with the federal government. Through FedConnect contractors will be able to receive, review and respond to contract pre- and post-award actions and documents such as correspondence, request for proposals, tasking instruments and contract modifications. The use of FedConnect also furthers the EPAs commitment to moving towards a paperless acquisition environment by reducing its carbon footprint and conducting its business in an ecologically friendly manner.  There is no charge to use FedConnect. In addition, all vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), as this facilitates registration for FedConnect. Please note that vendors MUST have their SAM profile set to public, otherwise FedConnect will not be able to access the SAM information required to validate vendor credentials. Registration may be completed and information regarding the registration process may be obtained at http://www.sam.gov. There is no charge for registration in SAM.

<DESC>PLA SYNOPSIS:<br /><br />The Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements, (PLAs), for a large scale construction contract, (Exceeding $80 million) for the following project:<br /><br />
<p>Project Description: Construct Airman Training Complex (ATC) Dormitory #6</p>
<p>Project Location: Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) - Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas</p>
<p>Summary: Construct an ATC dormitory of approximately 280,000 Gross Square Feet (GSF) that houses 1,248 Basic Military trainees (BMT).</p>
<p>Description of Proposed Construction:  This Request for Proposal (RFP) is a Design-Bid-Build (DBB), full and open competition contract for construction of a 1,248 person Basic Military Training (BMT) dormitory.  This is the sixth of eight (8) dormitories.  The dormitory is approximately 280,550 Gross Square Feet (GSF) and consists of: four (4) stories; reinforced concrete structure; elevator; precast concrete panels; and a standing seam metal roof.  Supporting facilities include a weapons cleaning pavilion, running track, exercise pads, parking lots, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection(AT/FP) low security wall with integrated street lights, and landscaping/irrigation.   Special foundations to support this new dormitory will be required.  The dormitory will include a building information system, intrusion detection system, energy monitoring and control system, fire/smoke detection, and alarm system, and connections to installation central systems.  Other supporting work includes water, sewer, gas, and electric utilities, exterior communications, site drainage, and final grading.  Access for individuals with disabilities will be provided.</p>
<p><br />DFAR 236.204 Disclosure of the magnitude of construction projects. Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. Period of Performance: 900 calendar days after notice to proceed, estimated.</p>
<p>PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy Subpart 22.503:</p>
<p>a.) Project Labor Agreement, (PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b.) An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p>1.) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and</p>
<p>2.) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br />a.) The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br />b.) The complexity of the project.<br />c.) Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d.) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br />e.) The use of PLAs on other comparable projects.<br />f.) The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g.) The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. h.) Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>Please reference FAR Provision: 52.222-33 "Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement" and FAR Clause: 52.222-34 Alternate I (May 2010) "Project Labor Agreement."</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a.) Should PLAs be executed on this selected large dollar contract at JBSA - Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?</p>
<p>b.) Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c.) Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d.) Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e.) Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or more subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades?</p>
<p><br />f.) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g.) Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h.) Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas area?</p>
<p>i.) Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and/or subcontractors to meet their Small Business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Note: For yes or no answers, please provide a supporting narrative.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via email ONLY to: vernon.valigura@usace.army.mil no later than 06 April 2018, 10:00 AM Central Standard Time.</p>

Offerors are cautioned against submitting multiple technical proposals that have large differences in prices between them, since step two will be awarded on a low bid basis.</p>
<p>The Government will forward a notice of unacceptability to an offeror when, upon completion of the proposal evaluation, there is a final determination of unacceptability. This will be done in accordance with the dates outlined in Part I below.</p>
<p>In the second step of this two-step sealed bid solicitation process, only bids based upon technical proposals determined to be acceptable. Bids in the second step will only be accepted electronically through WBSCM. Awards in the second step will be based on lowest price. Each bid in the second step must be based on the bidder's own technical proposals.</p>

If no time is specified in the IFB, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that bids or revisions are due.</p>
<p><br />(b)(1) Any technical proposal under step one of two-step sealed bidding, modification, revision, or withdrawal of such proposal received at the Government office designated in the request for technical proposals after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late technical proposal would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-</p>
<p>(i) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the request for technical proposals, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or</p>
<p>(ii) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt; or</p>
<p>(iii) It is the only proposal received and it is negotiated under Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>(2) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(c) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the technical proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(d) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that technical proposals cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of technical proposals by the exact time specified in the request for technical proposals, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the request for technical proposals, the time specified for receipt of technical proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the request for technical proposals on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(e) Technical proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of technical proposals. If the request for technical proposals authorizes facsimile technical proposals, they may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of proposals, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.214-31, Facsimile Bids. A technical proposal may be withdrawn in person by a bidder or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of technical proposals, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the technical proposal.</p>

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Cost of components means 
(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation

The data includes demographic data; third-party eligibility information; patient-based clinical data (e.g., health factors); and encounter-based clinical data (e.g., purpose of visit, procedures, medications, laboratory test results, radiological results).
