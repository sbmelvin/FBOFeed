<DESC>Waiver to Synopsis required IAW FAR 5.201
Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-18-01084 solicitation SPRTA1-18-Q-0150 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.

<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 18-REG10.  In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Refer to AAAP RLP paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space requirement.  Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>This FBO advertisement is hereby incorporated into the RLP 18-REG10 by way of reference as an RLP attachment.</p>

The Lease and all documents that constitute the Lease package can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice only; it is not a request for competitive proposals. There are no solicitations, specifications, and/or drawings available at this time. This Sources Sought Notice is for informational purposes only to determine the interest, and availability, of potential qualified contractors. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. The Government intends to use responses to this sources sought to make appropriate acquisition decisions for the project. NO AWARD will be made from this sources sought notice.
<p>All interested firms should respond to this notice.</p>
<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>This project is to award a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) to complete the construction of the Aviation Complex. It is anticipated the award of these follow-on phases upon the completion of the Aircraft Apron and Airfield Improvements project. The anticipated scope of work for the task orders issued under this SATOC includes the construction of an aviation hangar, aviation shops and paint shop spaces, secure spaces, and unit operations building type facilities.</p>
<p>The seed contract of the SATOC includes the construction of a multi-story secure operations building with an approximate area of 127,000 square feet. It will house operational and administrative spaces for the complex, including a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), data center, private and open offices, command suite, conference facilities, and personnel support spaces. Also, the building will include a warehouse, armory, indoor firing range, gymnasium, indoor aquatic training facility, medical aid station, and multi-purpose team room with a commercial kitchen.</p>
<p>The operations building will serve as the telecommunications and electronic site security hub for the entire complex. All critical electrical and communication systems must be able to connect and communicate seamlessly with other construction phases of the Aviation Complex. Power requirements include standard power, generator power and an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) requirement of approximately 500KVA. Due to the SCIF requirement, the project site must be fully secured twenty-four (24) hours a day during construction and have secure material storage in accordance with Intelligence Community Directive Number 705. Construction duration is expected to be 22 months.</p>
<p>The follow-on task order of the SATOC includes the construction of a secure aircraft hangar with multi-story shops and support spaces with an approximate area of 204,000 square feet. The hangar includes fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft bays with bridge cranes. It will be a long span steel structure with a deep foundation and high expansion foam fire protection system.</p>
<p>The ground floor shops and spaces will have direct access to the hangar and include Aircraft Life Saving Equipment (ALSE), paint, sheet metal and commo shops, and operations, and other related spaces.</p>
<p>The aircraft paint shop consists of a paint booth, equipment and paint storage, and provides space for paint stripping, corrosion removal, protective coating, chemical agent resistant coating, and painting of aircraft components. Second floor spaces provide operational and administrative spaces including a SCIF, data center, training areas, troop areas and support spaces.</p>
<p>This task order will also include final apron paving, access road paving, and pavement markings.</p>
<p>All critical electrical and communication systems of the aircraft hangar must be able to connect and communicate seamlessly with other construction phases of the Aviation Complex. Power requirements include standard power, generator power and a significant Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) requirement. Similar to the seed contract, due to the SCIF requirement, the project site must be fully secured twenty-four (24) hours a day during construction and have secure material storage in accordance with Intelligence Community Directive Number 705. Construction duration is also expected to be 24 months.</p>
<p>The operations building and aircraft hangar are scheduled to be funded for construction in FY 19 and FY 20, respectively. There is anticipated to be an overlap of about 16 months when the two projects will be under construction at the same time.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer has classified this requirement as Commercial and Institutional Building Construction - North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 236220. The small business size standard is $36.5 million.<br /><br />The order of magnitude for this effort is estimated between $100,000,000.00 and<br />$150,000,000.00.</p>

<p>2. Contract Information: CENWP expects to solicit a contract for either the lease &amp; laundering of ARC FLASH garments or for the purchase and laundering, or just laundering. The proposed requirement will be a competitive, firm-fixed price (FFP) contract. Responses to this Sources Sought announcement will be used by the Government to support and make acquisition strategy decisions, including, if appropriate, a small business set-aside decision.</p>

In addition, servicing includes placement, lease and pick up of a dirty clothing hamper, sufficient in size for the weekly number of rented garments with lockers or racks per employee. The contractor is also responsible for accountability of garments.</p>
<p>In contrast to the above model, this Sources Sought seeks to explore alternative approaches that may satisfy the District's overall requirements need. In this effort, we are asking for Industry's input in terms of standard or non-standard practices, cost effective models, be it by purchasing the garments independently, and having a laundering only contract or through a combination of approaches. The Pros/Cons of the approach proposed should outline a general industry pricing structure, benefits to the proposed alternate procurement strategy, proposed cost savings (if any), and any other commercial industry benefits to this alternate procurement method.</p>
<p>The Government is also seeking input towards a procurement strategy of either one year or a multi-year contract not to exceed a base plus two (2) optional years.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br />1.0 RFI TITLE: Develop TBI Assay using Banyan Biomarker's Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase (UCH-L1) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) reagents for use on a small, self-contained, field ready benchtop device.<br />2.0 AGENCY: United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command<br />3.0 OFFICE: United States Army Medical Materiel Development Activity<br />4.0 LOCATION: Fort Detrick, Maryland<br />5.0 SUBJECT: The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is working to develop U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved self-contained, field ready benchtop device to improve assays specific for UCH-L1 and GFAP biomarkers, to serve as an aid for evaluating mild TBI by detecting the presence of TBI-induced blood proteins using antigen-antibody interactions. <br />USAMRMC currently intends to modify Contract W81XWH-10-C-0251, adding new work to develop a less than 1 hour UCH-L1/GFAP Assay on a self-contained bench top device that has minimal associated equipment and reduces the logistical burden in military operations. This out of scope modification will be awarded to Banyan Biomarkers under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br />6.0 DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI or any follow-up information request. All information received in response to this RFI or any follow-up information request that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.<br />A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Government-wide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Government-wide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br />7.0 DESCRIPTION: During the past decade, over 340,000 service members have been diagnosed with a brain injury. Greater than 80% of these brain injuries have been classified as mild TBI (mTBI). However, the current testing methods that are available to diagnose battlefield brain injury are subjective and often rely on self-report of injury occurrence and symptoms. The military need to diagnose and triage TBI casualties is described in the Theater Combat Casualty Care Initial Capability Document dated October 2007 and the Joint Force Health Protection Joint Casualty Management Joint Capabilities Document dated June 11, 2008. There is widespread agreement among subject matter experts that there is no clinically validated device for the diagnosis of mild TBI (mTBI). <br />There is an interest in assays that can detect low levels of these blood proteins, in serum, using standard ELISA assays, compressed time ELISA assays and/or compact, self-contained, field ready devices. The U.S. Army has worked in collaboration with Banyan Biomarkers to discover and test protein biomarkers of TBI. To date, Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase (UCH-L1) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) have been tested in multiple clinical trials of patients with mild, moderate and severe TBI. The key objective in completing the requirements for this contract is FDA approval of the biomarker(s) for a TBI indication for use. <br />This requirement is for additional work to improve assays developed by Banyan Biomarkers Inc that are specific for UCH-L1 and GFAP biomarkers, to serve as an aid for evaluating mild TBI by detecting the presence of TBI-induced blood proteins using antigen-antibody interactions.<br />The first improvement requires Banyan to develop a &lt;1 hour UCH-L1/GFAP Assay using the same reagents currently optimized on the Synergy II Biotek instrument (device). Faster assay time is necessary because the assay on the benchtop device has a significant run time, which in turn means the assay has a low clinical utility. The second improvement requires Banyan to develop the assay on a self-contained bench top device that has minimal associated equipment and therefore reduces the logistical burden in military operations. <br />8.0 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: In response to this sources sought, please provide the following information to the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) Contract Specialist, Herbert Caj Keen, at herbert.e.keen.civ@mail.mil. Telephonic communication will not be considered as submission nor receive a response. Email submissions must be received no later than 4:00 PM Eastern on 10 January 2018.<br />8.1. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition and identify alternatives or solutions. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.<br />8.2. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, identify business size (large business or a small business), and if applicable, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.<br />8.3. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for a follow-on requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.<br />8.4. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.

SCOPE:


PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
Amarillo VA Health Care System, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Services For Oncotype DX testing 


The Amarillo VA Health Care System (VAHCS) and Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service (P&LMS) located in Amarillo, Texas, requests a Vendor to perform services in the area of gene expression assay and Oncotype DX testing for cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate. This specialized testing is beyond our scope of services to provide in-house.

BACKGROUND:

The use of the Oncotype DX test is a recommendation by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) that is followed by our former VISN 18 Hematologists and Oncologists counter parts. These tests aid in determining the next step to take in the treatment and prognosis of patients diagnosed with early stage I or stage II, node negative, estrogen-positive invasive breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer. 

The Oncotype DX portfolio of breast, colon and prostate cancer tests applies advanced genomic science to reveal the unique biology of a patient s tumor in order to optimize cancer treatment decisions. By providing answers to key questions about the aggressiveness of and appropriate treatment for early-stage cancer, our practice-changing tests help physicians and patients select the right treatment at the right time in each individual case. In this way, Oncotype DX testing helps patients and their physicians to optimize their cancer care and outcomes, enabling many patients to avoid unnecessary procedures and therapies, and saving the healthcare system billions of dollars in unnecessary costs.

Vendor/ Contractor shall design and install an upgrade to a fully integrated state of the art A/V system for the NCOD Training Room located at Suite 230, 11500 Northlake Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio, and complete the work as described below.  This SOW is to perform the design, integration, installation and training as identified in this document.


1.  Introduction:

The NCOD office is located in Suite 230, 11500 Northlake Place, Cincinnati, Ohio. The current suite includes an approximately 1700 net square foot (NSF) training room that is dividable, by  Air Wall  into two approximately 850 NSF training rooms (Attachment A).

A current fully integrated A/V System is installed in this space and functions as one system when the room is used in whole and functions as two separate systems when the room is divided via use of the  Air Wall .  

NCOD intends to furnish selected equipment to be integrated into the existing system as listed in Section 5.  The primary intent of this upgrade is to enhance audio capabilities both within the training room and for virtual engagements with the installation of (2) advanced ceiling array microphones.  

This  Statement of Work  describes the requirements for the system operation, function and use.  The Vendor/Contractor will be responsible for the design and installation of the system to function as an integrated system that provides the maximum flexibility, is expandable, provides the highest audio and video quality, and is user friendly.

The system is to be  user friendly  and capable of being used as single integrated system using a single wireless controller when the room is used in whole and must function as two separate and independent systems when the room is divided by the  Air Wall .

System shall be flexible and easily adapted to various room configurations including but not limited to meeting room, classroom, lecture, and grouped tables.  For this reason, use of wireless devices shall be utilized to the extent practicable to eliminate the need for in floor connections and trip hazards presented by wired systems.

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT-VET SERVICES SOLE SOURCE
<SOLNBR>NFFT5000-18-00495
<CONTACT>Noah N. Nielsen, Phone 2065266034, Email noah.nielsen@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT
<p><br />PLEASE NOTE THAT NO CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED REGARDING THIS NOTICE. <br />ANY INQUIRIES MUST BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO: <br />Noah Nielsen, CONTRACTING OFFICER AT <br />noah.nielsen@noaa.gov</p>
<p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), hereby gives public notice of the intent to negotiate a sole-source, five-year Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract pursuant to the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition (including brand name) under 41 U.S.C. 1901, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) up to $7M as authorized by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.500(a) and implemented by FAR 13.501(a), which allows for "sole source (including brand name) acquisitions."<br />NMFS requires the services of an on-call contract veterinarian to provide veterinary services for marine mammals and sea turtles in the Pacific Islands region. Veterinary services are frequently needed during marine mammal or sea turtle stranding responses and rehabilitation efforts. In many cases this need can be met by an in-house veterinarian (federal employee) who works for NMFS PIFSC. However, there are some situations when veterinary services are required on an on-call basis that cannot be met by existing NMFS resources. These situations can occur when multiple strandings, injuries and/or disease incidents happen simultaneously or when services are needed in remote locations. NMFS is seeking to meet this additional need through a contract with a qualified entity.</p>
<p>The Government is only aware a of few qualified individuals that may be able to perform this requirement. However, these individuals either have full-time employment or have entered retirement, which precludes them from meeting the requirement of being available on a 24/7 on-call basis. Present market research shows that there is only one individual that meets the necessary qualifications and is available on the required 24/7 on-call basis on the island of Oahu. This individual, Dr. Gregg Levine, is therefore determined to be the only qualified private sector veterinarian capable of meeting the requirements of the intended contract. Dr. Levine has provided the required services to NOAA Fisheries under previous contracts and has valuable experience in providing veterinarian services to animals in the Pacific Islands region. Due to these facts, Dr. Levine is the only source available that will satisfy the requirement.</p>
<p>Vendors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit, in writing, an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirement. All written responses must include proof of possessing permits and a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information, demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as previously stated. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 8:00 AM (Pacific Standard Time), Monday, January 8, 2018. The responses must be submitted via e-mail to Michael Drummond, Contract Specialist, at noah.nielsen@noaa.gov.</p>
<p><br />NOTHING HEREIN SHOULD BE MISCONSTRUED AS A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS, QUOTES OR BIDS. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTATION IS AVAILABLE OR WILL BE ISSUED.</p>
<p><br />The National Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541940, and the size standard is 7.5M.</p>
<p><br />The provisions and clauses to be incorporated in any solicitation and proposed Firm-Fixed-Price contract shall be those currently in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-96, published 6 November 2017.</p>

<SUBJECT>SEUG RELM BK HAND-HELD RADIOS FY18
<SOLNBR>140P1218Q0003
<ARCHDATE>02052018
<CONTACT>
<DESC>This special notice informs the public that The National Park Servbice SouthEast Utah Group intends to award a non-competitive firm-fixed price contract for RELM Wireless Hand-Held BK KNG-M150 and KNG-P150S Radios.  The award will be made directly to RELM Wireless BK Technologies utilizing the Department of the Interior FieldCom multiple award IDIQ. A signed Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file; the contents are provided herein.

1. Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):

SouthEast Utah Groups Telecommunication shop is responsible to perform maintenance, repair and programming of all park radios. As such a substantial commitment to the RELM Wireless products has occurred over the last few years by various park units supported by SEUG Telecommunication Shop.  In keeping with the procurement of a brand that the SEUG Telecommunication Shop is already setup to maintain where no additional technical training will be required to support the RELM brand of radios is the most cost effective.  South East Utah Groups topology is an incredibly vast and complex canyon system which makes VHF radio communications on the ground incredibly difficult; the KNG portable radios have the ability to transmit at 6 watts out over both digital and analog transmissions without having to change channels which is instrumental to achieving communications in this area.   
 The National Park Service (NPS) also requires the ability to `clone or program portable or mobile radios from another radio during incident response scenarios. During incident response, all available radio assets can be called into service. The primary incident response requiring cloning occurs during emergencies and non-emergency incidents. During incident response scenarios, time and resources are limited which require radios to be programmed outside of normal technical facilities, generally in a remote location. Additionally, qualified technical personnel may not be available to program a non-clone able radio.
Due to Wildland fire suppression needs, NPS requires cloning compatibility with the radio cache maintained by the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) based in Boise, ID. State and local agencies that cooperate with NPS incident response generally maintain programming/cloning interoperability with the NIFC fire cache as well. 
Radio programming methods and data are unique to a given suppliers product line. At present it is not possible to clone radios between multiple manufacturers. Therefore, the NPS requires the product of a single manufacturer. 
It is of the Parks best interest to continue toward developing and maintaining a standard of the same or similar model of equipment across all radios in the park, which will result in lower maintenance costs over time (fewer duplicate parts for different models of radios to be kept in stock), reduced costs over time to purchase duplicate accessories for multiple models of radios (and so more staff can share accessories), and radio operational safety will be increased because more users will be using the same make/model of radio, simplifying training and allowing more staff to be familiar with how to use the same radio.
Each different brand requires additional learning and can reduce our ability for timely responses to our users.  Hand held radios are a critical component to employee safety and communication with field personnel, single programming code plugs ensure full interoperability.  
By having only one troubleshooting process, we can streamline our support and provide our users with a quicker turnaround in the event of equipment failure.
Also creating radio programming images (code plugs) that contain the required configurations for channel configuration and repeater control, this standard expedites the setup of new equipment.  The use of images significantly reduces the setup time because we do not have to configure each device and security settings each time.
Each brand has unique programming software and setup that are particular to that brand.  By staying with one brand NPS reduces the number of images that are needed to be created, tested, and maintained.
It is anticipated that this Delivery Order will be approximately $62,000.00.
Only one vendor, BK Technologies RELM Wireless can sell and original product.

3. Market Research. Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest: 

Searches using Google, Department of Homeland Security FieldCom  contract , Department of Interior FieldCom contract, and GSA Advantage.  A Special Notice for this action will be posted at FBO, and any information received in response will be taken under consideration by NPS. Local knowledge of the vendor pool indicates this is the only viable service. 

4. If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:

a. Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist.

b. The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<CONTACT>James Robinson, Email James.R.Robinson@uscg.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this special notice is to synopsize a six-month extension on an existing competitively awarded contract. The USCG intends to extend the duration of existing contract HSCG23-13-D-PMF003 by six months. HSCG23-13-D-PMF003 and all of its options were fully competed at the time of award, except for the six-month option to extend services in accordance with FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services (NOV 1999). FAR 52.217-8 was included in the contract's clauses at the time of solicitation and award, but it was not competed during the solicitation phase.
<p>This is a contract extension for the continued SAPS requirement. SAPS is an essential component of the FMS mission. SAPS support allows the USCG to provide a wide range of services on vessels being transferred to other nations around the globe. Without continuity of operations for uninterrupted SAPS service, a gap in service would adversely impact the core mission of providing timely maritime vessel transfers to foreign nations. Without SAPS, the USCG would experience significant delays in the transference of these vessels under the Excess Defense Article (EDA) Program, discredit our service commitment to provide these mission critical services, and possibly impact international relations due to delays and lose of continuity of operations.</p>
<p>It has been determined that proceeding directly with action was appropriate to be concurrent with the synopsis period in order to prevent a lapse in service that could seriously discredit the Coast Guard in the eyes of the international maritime community. A new contract to continue contract in its entirety is forthcoming. The new contract is currently planned to be an open market competitive contract to be awarded no later than July 23, 2018.</p>
<p>This extension period has the following CLINs:</p>
<p>CLIN 50001: Firm Fixed Price Services CLIN</p>
<p>CLIN 50002: T&amp;M Services CLIN</p>
<p>CLIN 50003: ODC CLIN</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the SAM database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and</p>

The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It includes-</p>
<p>(1)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p>(b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.</p>
<p>(3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in CCR may be required in lieu of SAM.</p>
<p>(c) If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) A contractor may obtain a DUNS number-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at <a href="http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform">http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform</a> or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov">https://www.acquisition.gov</a> or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ''not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) For long-term contracts--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<SUBJECT>Federal Crop Insurance Program Spot Check List Study
<SOLNBR>RMASLC010418
<RESPDATE>011218
<CONTACT>Julie M. Simpson, Contract Specialist, Phone 8169261200, Email julie.simpson@kcc.usda.gov
<DESC>The Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 amended the Federal Crop Insurance Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to use data mining and related technologies to ensure the integrity of the Federal crop insurance program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency (RMA), which oversees the Federal crop insurance program, subsequently partnered with the Center for Agribusiness Excellence (CAE) at Tarleton State University to develop and administer a data mining and warehousing program as authorized by the Act. RMA, working with CAE, now makes extensive use of data mining products to enhance the integrity of the Federal crop insurance program. Data mining is used to detect and deter fraud, waste and abuse by identifying producers, insurance agents and loss adjusters whose insurance claim outcomes are anomalous as compared to their peers.
<p>The Spot Check List is the most well-known, comprehensive, and routine application of data mining to the Federal crop insurance program. Annually, RMA uses objective, data-driven criteria to develop a list of producers whose loss experience is anomalous relative to similarly situated producers in the geographic area. Research and observations gathered from RMA field staff and approved insurance provider (AIP) personnel are used to identify "schemes" that have been used to exploit the crop insurance program through fraudulent or abusive insurance claims. The claimed losses may be due to a structured scheme (e.g., yield switching), or may simply reflect a pattern of unusually high loss ratios, loss frequencies, and/or severe losses relative to peers. Data mining algorithms are developed based on the schemes and are used to identify policies with anomalous loss experience. Loss comparisons are by local geographic area and for the same crop, type, and practice. The policies so identified are placed on the annual SCL. In recent years, the number of producers placed on the SCL has typically been around 1,700, and the policy count about 3,000. It is important to note that being placed on the SCL does not mean a producer has engaged in fraudulent or abusive activities. Rather, it means only the experience of a producer on the SCL is not consistent with that of peers and warrants further scrutiny.</p>
<p>The producers placed on the SCL are notified their farming operations are subject to additional monitoring and inspections during the growing season to ensure that claims for losses are legitimate, and to serve as a deterrent to potentially fraudulent or abusive activities. From 2001 to 2011, the USDA Farm Service Agency had sole responsibility for conducting the SCL reviews. The FSA review consists of growing season and pre-harvest inspections to assess whether the condition of the insured crop is consistent with that of other producers in the area. Beginning with 2012 the AIPs assumed responsibility for a portion of the SCL reviews in order to make more effective use of available government and AIP resources. The AIP review is more comprehensive than that of FSA, and consists of a full policy review, of which in-field inspections are but one component. The allocation of policies between FSA and the AIPs is at RMA's discretion and can change based on workload, changes in other program requirements, etc. Currently, SCL policies are split approximately 50-50 between AIPs and FSA. In general, the assignment of individual SCL policies to the AIPs or FSA is random so as to avoid potential systematic biases, i.e., a policy has an equal probability of being assigned to an AIP or to FSA.</p>
<p>The impact of the SCL as a means of fraud/abuse mitigation is measured as cost avoidance, the amount by which indemnity payments to producers on the SCL decline after being placed on the list. From 2001 through 2015 the cumulative cost avoidance is estimated to be $1.16 billion. Annual cost avoidance estimates are shown in the table below.</p>
<p>Estimated Cost Avoidance Attributed to Spot Check List, 2001-2015 ($ Million)<br />2001 $48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2009&nbsp; $89<br />2002 $112&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2010&nbsp; $112<br />2003 $81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2011&nbsp; $46<br />2004 $71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2012&nbsp; $91<br />2005 $140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2013&nbsp; $70<br />2006 $27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2014&nbsp; $54<br />2007 $85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2015&nbsp; $61<br />2008 $73 <br />2001-15 cumulative $1,160</p>
<p>These cost avoidance estimates rely on before-after comparisons of indemnities paid to producers on the SCL. While there have been some refinements over the years (e.g., to account for changes in prices), the basic approach remains unchanged. RMA is concerned the methodology may not adequately control or account for other factors potentially relevant to measuring the impact of the SCL. For example, differences in growing conditions between years will clearly have a significant impact on changes in indemnity payments through time. Also, it is possible that the reduction in indemnities may reflect some degree of mean-reversion for producers on the SCL, i.e., a natural convergence to long-run loss expectations. Other potential confounding factors include the differences in the inherent riskiness of land farmed by producers on the SCL relative to non-SCL producers, the impact of micro-climates and localized weather events, and a variety of other environmental influences that may impact expected loss frequencies and/or magnitudes. Another concern with the current cost avoidance measure is that it does not consider monetary impacts beyond the initial year the producer is placed on the SCL, though the effects presumably extend beyond one year. In addition, the current measure does not consider the possible deterrent effect on the neighbors of those placed on the SCL, individuals who may have otherwise been tempted to "push the limits". An additional complication is that the impact of SCL reviews conducted by AIPs may be different from those conducted by FSA. Because of considerations as described above, RMA believes a more rigorous evaluation of the SCL and the cost avoidance methodology is needed to better assess the impact of the SCL as a means to enhance program integrity.</p>
<p>Federal crop insurance is routinely identified as the linchpin of the farm safety net by producers, and assuring public support is critical to the sustainability of the program. Fraudulent or abusive activities not only waste scarce taxpayer resources, but also undermine public confidence in the program. Thus, RMA is constantly seeking ways to reduce or eliminate program vulnerabilities while providing responsive, valuable risk protection to producers. The SCL is a key element of RMA's overall strategy to combat fraud, waste and abuse in the federal crop insurance program. As such, it is imperative that RMA fully understand the monetary and behavioral impacts of the SCL as a means to ensure program integrity. Results from research will help RMA to better measure the impacts of the SCL, improve the SCL process through refinement of data mining algorithms and enhance the reviews conducted thereunder, deploy available government (RMA, FSA) and AIP resources more appropriately, and strengthen the integrity of the Federal crop insurance program.</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure. (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:</p>
<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:</p>
<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1000 hrs PST, January 11, 2017.</p>

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

Price - Vendor will complete the Price Schedule (attached) with proposed contract line item prices inserted in appropriate spaces.  
a. In order to evaluate the mark up on parts (CLINs 0004, 1004, 2004, 3004 and 4004), the Government will evaluate quotes by multiplying the mark up % submitted by the vendor in the price schedule by $5,000.00 to get a total line item amount.  For example, if the vendor submits a markup of 20%, the total evaluated price for CLINS 0004, 1004, 2004, 3004 and 4004 will be $6,000.00 each ($5,000.00 *1.20).   The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total revised price for CLINs 0004, 1004, 2004, 3004 and 4004 to the total quote amount.  This is for evaluating quotes ONLY.

Past Performance:  Provide (3) references of work, similar in scope and size with the requirement detailed in the Performance Work Statement.  References must include contact information; brief description of the work completed, and contract # (if relevant). Please utilize Attachment   Past Performance Worksheet for your references and please submit as part of your quote submission.  References may be checked by the Contracting Officer to ensure your company is capable of performing the Performance Work Statement. The Government also reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources to include PPIRS. 
Technical: The vendor s quote shall be evaluated to determine if the organization has the experience and capabilities to provide the requested services in accordance with the Performance Work Statement.  The contractor shall provide the following: 

a. The vendor shall demonstrate that it is 
OHSA Trained Employees in electrical safety
Employees Trained to NFPA 70E
 NETA certified Company 

b. The vendor shall demonstrate that it is factory trained on the Russelectric equipment to be tested and have a minimum of 20 years of experience, as many of the VA sites have older gear operating on site in excess of 15 years.

c. The vendor shall provide a Certification of Thermographer Level 2 or greater for the engineer/Technician.

d. Provide example of inspection and imaging report meeting stated objectives in the Performance Work Statement.


Veterans Preference Factor (per 852.215-70): The Government will assign evaluation credit for an Offeror (prime contractor) which is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVOSB) or a Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB). Non-SDVOSB/VOSB Offerors proposing to use SDVOSBs or VOSBs as subcontractors will receive some consideration under this evaluation Factor. 
For SDVOSBS/VOSBs: In order to receive credit under this Factor, an Offeror shall submit a statement of compliance that it qualifies as a SDVOSB or VOSB in accordance with VAAR 852.215-70,  Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors . Offerors are cautioned that they must be registered and verified in Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database (http://www.VetBiz.gov). 
Verified SDVOSBs will receive a 3% price credit (e.g. if a SDVOSB submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $97.00).
Verified VOSBs will received a 2% price credit (e.g. if a VOSB submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $98.00).
For Non-SDVOSBs/VOSBs: To receive some consideration under this Factor, an Offeror must state in its proposal the names of SDVOSB(s) and/or VOSB(s) with whom it intends to subcontract, and provide a brief description and the approximate dollar values of the proposed subcontracts. Additionally, proposed SDVOSB/VOSB Subcontractors must be registered and verified in VIP database (http://www.VetBiz.gov) in order to receive some consideration under the Veteran s Involvement Factor.

If a vendor submits a subcontracting plan where it will be using a SDVOSB, it will receive a 1.5% price credit (e.g. if this vendor submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $98.50).
If a vendor submits a subcontracting plan where it will be using a VOSB, it will receive a 1% price credit (e.g. if this vendor submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $99.00).



Options: The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The Government will evaluate prices for the option under FAR 52.217-8by using the last year s option prices to calculate the price for six months of effort, and adding that amount to the base and other option years to arrive at the total.


A written notice of award, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote s specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695.</p>

If a line item cannot be separately priced, you must notify the buyer through the FedBid Submit a Question feature regarding which line item(s) should be included in which other line item(s) and request reposting.

This buy will then be reposted with Q&A based on the questions that come in (if applicable).<BR><BR>The Contracting Officer will indicate elsewhere in this Buy as to whether responses will be evaluated for award based either upon (a) price and pricing factors only (Bids/Quotes) or (b) price and other factors (Proposals/Quotes).  All Bids/Proposals/Quotations must conform to the listed specifications or the Statement of Work.  If award criteria are based upon (b) price and other factors, the Contracting Officer shall clearly indicate the criteria to be applied elsewhere in this Buy.<BR><BR>In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Bidder/Offeror/Quoter must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this Buy. Submissions can be sent to clientservices@fedbid.com.<BR><BR>For Exact Match Only Commodity Buys- NO SUBSTITUTIONS, EXACT MATCH ONLY.

FAR 52.211-6.<BR><BR>FAR 15.304(e) Unless all offers are rejected, award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best overall value, price and other factors considered.  In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), the evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price; however, cost/price will contribute substantially to the selection decision.<BR><BR>Some items may require thawing and cooking to determine specifications compliance. Receipt of delivery may be conditional for a period of five (5) days in order to allow for adequate examination and testing. Items that fail to meet specifications will be refused. Items which are conditionally received, and found to be unacceptable, must be picked up at the vendors expense within two (2) weeks of noncompliance notification.

Contractor Failure to meet delivery schedules without an excusable delay and or failure to conform to contract specifications will negatively affect the contractors history of past performance. Past performance may be used by the government to make future award decisions and or may result in a finding that the quoter is not responsible for award of future requirements.<BR><BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award.All deliveries must be palletized unless prior arrangements were agreed to by warehouse staff.All non-frozen, perishable foods must be delivered between 34 degrees F and 40 degrees F.All canned goods must be delivered above 34 degrees F and not frozen.All frozen foods must be delivered at 0 degrees F or below.Any product that indicates prior thawing will be refused.All certified religious diet items must be marked with the Kosher Symbol on individual packages or the item will be refused.All items must strictly be in compliance with the BOP National Menu Specifications.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE<br /><br /><strong>Question:</strong> Can you accommodate 196 CF cylinders (instead of minimum 223 CF/cyl)?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;With 196 CF cyl, we would need deliveries every 3 weeks instead of every 4. This would change the requirement from up to 4900 CF on hand to 3920 CF on hand, equating to 20 cylinders on site. Actual amount of hydrogen used for the period would remain unchanged at 59,500 CF maximum. We would not be able to simply store more cylinders on site with 196 CF. Our standard safety directive is to store no more than 15 cylinders on site, but at Glasgow we received a waiver that allows us to store up to 22 cylinders max due to the remoteness of the site. In order to go with 196 cf/cyl and deliveries every 4 weeks, we'd need to store 25 cylinders on site, and that request has been denied by our safety office. <strong>Quotes for the smaller cylinder size and more frequent delivery schedule will be accepted and evaluated in accordance with the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable review. </strong>If an alternate quote is accepted for award of the contract, the Statement of Need will be updated prior to award to reflect the changes.&nbsp;

Offers shall be submitted on or before the close date/time as specified in this solicitation. Offers are due no later than Thursday, January 11th, 2018 by 12:00 p.m. CST (New Orleans, LA).  Any contractor submissions or requests for information received after the closing date and time of this solicitation (for any reason) are late, and shall not be considered.

Offers that are late due to e-mail transmission problems/issues will not be accepted. The government will acknowledge receipt of offers (by e-mail) if received prior to the close/date time of the solicitation (if an e-mail address is provided). The government s acknowledgement that an offer has been received shall not constitute an offer s technical acceptability or unacceptability (because the government is not able to evaluate offers during or immediately following the close of a solicitation). In lieu of sending by e-mail, eligible offerors are authorized to send/submit their offers by mail (USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL) or courier providing their offers are received on or before the close date/time of the solicitation (Thursday, January 11th, 2018 by 12:00 p.m. CST (New Orleans, LA)).

<p><br />THE PURPOSE OF AMENDMENT 2 TO SOLICITATION W58RGZ-16-R-0225 (VANEAXIAL FAN) IS TO ANSWER TWO (2) QUESTIONS FROM AN APPROVED SOURCE VENDOR. THE RESPONSE DATE OF 5 JANUARY 2018 TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS REMAINS IN EFFECT. THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>Q1. On Page 3 of 64, para. 21 of the above Sol. it states "Access to DLA EMALL is not authorized" Is this a<br />correct statement, or, is this statement an accidental carry over from a previous requirement? Please verify.</p>
<p>A1: The statement is correct that "Access to DLA EMALL is not authorized".</p>
<p>Q2. DMWR-1-4140-228 Dated June 20th 2012, page 3-5 contains a table named "Serial numbers of Axial Fans with Shafts to be Replaced". This Table lists approximately 156 Serial Numbered Fans. It has been noted that 14 years ago these same Serial Numbers were also listed in what was the current DMWR then. My question is does the US Army have any way of determining how many of these SN's have had the Shafts changed in these 14 Years ? Is there any more current SN Data available considering how dated this information is?</p>
<p>A2: DMWR-1-4140-228 dated 20 June 2012 has been updated as of 30 June 2017. The 2017 DMWR version possess the current list of serial numbered axial fans with shafts to be replaced in Table 2 of Preshop Analysis.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT seeks to lease the following office space through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP):
<p><strong>City</strong>: Helena	<br /><strong>State</strong>: Montana	<br /><strong>Delineated Area</strong>: North - East Custer Ave, West - Mt. Helena Park, South - Gold Rush Ave, East - I-15. The delineated area also includes a 2 mile radius around the Helena Regional Airport.<br /><strong>Minimum ABOA Sq. Ft</strong>.: 800	<br /><strong>Maximum ABOA Sq. Ft.</strong>: 1,200	<br /><strong>Space Type</strong>: Office	<br /><strong>Term</strong>: Up to 15 Years	<br /><strong>Agency Unique Requirements</strong>: N/A<br /><strong>Agency Tenant Improvement Allowance</strong>:	$38.7942/USF</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO OFFER</strong>: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 18-REG08.  In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Refer to AAAP RLP paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space requirement.  Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>This FBO advertisement is hereby incorporated into the RLP 18-REG08 by way of reference as an RLP attachment.</p>
<p>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the requirements in this FBO advertisement and in the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing offers.  Offerors can draft an offer at any time; however, you can only submit an offer during the Open Period.</p>
<p>The offered space must comply with the requirements in this FBO advertisement and RLP 18-REG08 and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance with the terms of the Lease.  The Lease and all documents that constitute the Lease package can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p><em><strong>*</strong> If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</em></p>

<DESC>To support the bed down of F-35A aircraft at Nellis AFB, NV, additions to two existing maintenance facilities will be constructed. Facilities selected for expansion include Missile Maintenance Facility, Building 10432 and Munitions Maintenance Facility, Building 10439.
<p>Building 10432 Missile Maintenance Facility<br />The Missile Maintenance Facility is inside of the Base Munitions Storage Area perimeter. The building is located on a down-sloping site and will require fill to support construction of the bay addition and added vehicle access clearance.<br />Expansion of Building 10432 will consist of adding a single 50' x 60' (nominal) bay at the west end of the structure. The expansion bay will attach to the existing reinforced concrete blast wall at the west side of the building and will include a new reinforced concrete blast wall at the west end of the new bay. The bay will be serviced by a single 2 ton overhead hoist providing full area coverage. The roofing over the bay will consist of a standing seam metal explosive venting system with restraining devices capable of releasing blast overpressure conditions in the event of an accidental explosion.</p>
<p>Building 10439 Munitions Maintenance Facility<br />The Munitions Maintenance Facility is inside of the Base Munitions Storage Perimeter. The building is located on an up- sloping site which will require cut to clear a level site for construction of the addition and added vehicle access. Expansion of Building 10439 will consist of adding two 30' x 50' (nominal) bays at the east side of the structure. Location of existing utilities precludes construction of the expansion bays adjacent to the existing building. Therefore, the new expansion bays will be separated from the existing building by approximately 17 feet. Since the new addition will be a separate structure apart from Building 10439, NAFB Facilities Management will assign a new building number 10440 for identification. The west bay of the Building 10440 will serve as a light duty maintenance bay and the east bay will serve munitions maintenance operations. Exterior walls of Building 10440 will consist of reinforced concrete masonry units while the bay separation wall will be reinforced concrete. The munitions maintenance bay will be provided with a 2 ton overhead hoist. Roofing at the light duty bay will be a standard structural standing seam metal system, with a restrained explosive venting standing seam metal roof system installed over the munitions maintenance bay.</p>
<p>General Features<br />Existing utilities serving the buildings will be upgraded as required and extended to the new Building 10432 addition and Building 10440. At Building 10439, existing service utilities will be extended to the new Building 10440 through an above-grade utility corridor spanning over the existing below-grade utilities routed parallel to the east side of Building 10439. Lightning Protection is a key activity for these projects and will require verification during construction and a Third Party approval of the completed system.</p>

<DESC><p>The Request for Proposal (RFP)/Solicitation to provide non-personal, healthcare housekeeping and related services in support of Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), West Oahu and multiple Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the health service area (HSA) of the US Army Garrison - Hawaii. This acquisition is solicited as a small business set aside under other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.203(a). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this solicitation is 561720. This solicitation will be awarded using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable evaluation criteria. The agency proposes to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders for healthcare housekeeping services will be issued. An IDIQ contract is the optimum contract type for this effort as an exact quantity and/or appropriate categorization of services (Type I, II, III, IV, V, VI) cannot be determined on an MTF-specific, individual room basis at the time of contract award. The resultant FFP task orders issued against the IDIQ will clearly describe TAMC MTF-specific healthcare housekeeping requirements and services to be performed and provide for prices that will not be subject to any adjustment on the basis of the small business contractor's cost experience in performing this contract. All services shall be FFP and subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards (41 U.S.C. 67). The solicitation and subsequent contract will include contract line item numbers (CLINs) with 5 one-year ordering periods. The anticipated IDIQ contract will obligate the government to the minimum guarantee of $1,500.00 for the post award conference. The entire amount of the minimum guarantee will be obligated against fiscal year (FY) 18 funds. Further obligations will arise as task orders are awarded and obligations will be charged to the FY in which the order is placed. Healthcare housekeeping services are required for 60 months starting 1 September 2018 through 31 July 2023. All elements of the RFP shall be submitted by the Offeror with a proposal no later than the date/time shown in block 8 of the Standard Form (SF) 1449, Solicitation/Contract Order for Commercial Items. The square feet (SF) for cleaning of each Medical Center is varied; however, the estimated SF for TAMC is 1,594,803 SF.</p>

<p>_____     Market research was performed on (Date) and did not identify any potential acceptable locations.  This memorandum serves as documentation that the acquisition approach, non-competitive procurement, resulted in no alternatives.  The Lease Contracting Officer has determined there is only one reasonable source. <br />__X__    Market research was performed on 10/16/2017 and identified potential acceptable locations. Due to mission related rational, the Lease Contracting Officer has determined that there is only one responsible source.  <br />_____    Market research was performed on (Date) and identified potential acceptable locations. With full consideration, the Lease Contracting Officer has determined that a single source procurement is the most viable option due to cost, and the agency's mission requirement to be located outside of the CBD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Redacted has an ongoing project to relocate them from federal space. However, there have been delays in the project and the agency will not be able to move before the expiration of the current lease on Redacted. Therefore an 18 month extension must be negotiated for the current lease until completion of their new space Redacted. Moving the agency to a new location would not be cost feasible for such a short term contract, and would be unnecessarily disruptive to their mission.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION<br />By signature on this justification for Other than Full and Open Competition, the Contracting Officer certifies that the award of this procurement is in the Government's best interest and that this Justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
