<CONTACT>jennifer.berns, 410-410-0063

<a href="mailto:jennifer.berns@us.army.mil">CECOM Contracting Center (CECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>The Army plans to rapidly acquire the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System (EMARSS), the Army's future force airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. EMARSS is a manned multi-INT Airborne Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) system that provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets in day/night, near-all-weather conditions with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS aircraft will be located within Aerial Exploitation Battalions (AEB), which are assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM).  The EMARSS system will consist of a commercial derivative aircraft equipped with Electro-optic/Infrared (EO/IR) Full Motion Video (FMV) sensor, a COMINT collection system, an Aerial Precision Guidance (APG) system, line-of-site (LOS) tactical and beyond line-of-site (LOS/BLOS) communications suites, two operator workstations and a self-protection suite.<BR>EMARSS will operate as a single platform in support of tactical missions.  Mission altitude and flight tracks are chosen to optimize sensor data collection on the target area of interest while avoiding known threats.  Flight tracks may be selected to strike a balance among the capabilities of multiple sensors, or to optimize collection from individual sensors based upon the daily collection tasking dictated by the tactical commanders Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs).  EMARSS will provide efficient response to Combat Forces ISR tasking with centralized Processing, Exploitation & Dissemination (PED) of ISR while simultaneously transmitting critical FMV and intelligence products to engaged tactical forces.   <BR>Congressional discussions identified the desire that EMARSS be a program of record. The program will be initially based on an Army G-3/5/7 Directed Requirement (DR) to field this capability within 18 months of contract award.  The appropriate Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirements documents are in development and the program will enter the acquisition process in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  <BR> Army management is planning to convene a Material Development Decision (MDD) review in 2Q FY10.   The decision to pursue EMARSS is a direct result of relooking the Armys approach to Airborne Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and applying the lessons learned from current overseas operations.  <BR>The period of performance for the EMD contract is anticipated to be 42 months.  The delivery of the first four (4) EMARSS systems shall be within 18 months of contract award and the remaining 24 months will focus on additional testing as well as sustainment and maintenance of the systems.  An option for LRIP is anticipated to be part of this effort. <BR><BR>CECOM Contracting Center on behalf of Program Manager Aerial Common Sensor (ACS)/ Product Manager ACS-Integration is seeking interested sources to provide information and comments on the EMARSS program draft documents to include, at this time, the draft EMARSS Performance Work Statement (PWS), draft Government Furnished Property (GFP) list, the draft Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRL) , and the EMARSS draft Performance Based Specification (Unclassified Extract).  <BR>This request is for information and planning purposes only and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.   Please note that these are only working draft documents, which may be significantly changed and differ from the final solicitation documents when released.  The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this posting. The information received will not obligate the Government in any manner nor will the Government reimburse contractors for any costs associated with submittal of the requested information.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, Morgantown, WV, Health Effects Lab Division, Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch in support of the Computational Biology Team requires professional services for the Configurational Entropy in Receptor-Ligand Binding: The MIE-NN Method.
<p>I. Background<br />Modern biomedical research recognizes the critical role of computational studies in biology, molecular medicine, and toxicology. The goal of the Computational Biology Team is focused on the calculation of the thermodynamic concept of entropy for molecular systems involved in binding smaller ligands to receptors located on larger macromolecular systems. Specifically, the contribution of rotation about intramolecular bonds and the constraint of associated energetics of those bonds with binding of ligands is the focus of the Configurational Entropy Project.<br />The mission of the Computational Biology Team is focused on modeling and quantitatively estimating entropy using the fundamental and well established theories of statistical mechanics. In collaboration with key investigators at an eastern university, the Team had successfully identified a tractable method to deal with the most challenging aspect of modeling the energetics of binding-the configurational entropy.1 It combines the theory of mutual information expansion (MIE) originally identified by our collaborative investigators2 with the non-parametric methods of nearest neighbor (NN) estimation of entropy identified by the Team.3 It is called the MIE-NN method. This appears to be a novel method with far reaching implications in the fields of chemical toxicity characterization and of drug design. Initial successes in simple molecular systems are being validated in more realistic systems, and expanded to include effects of solvation and ion binding.<br />II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract<br />1. Implement software needed to estimate configurational entropy with the MIE-NN method, allowing for calculations in large systems with several hundred variables. Due to the sheer physical size of computer files used and the number of variables analyzed for such large systems (e.g. cyclodextrin and ER&#61537;), an enormous burden is placed on computer resources to read and edit these files. It is necessary to develop software procedures to provide an accurate, efficient, and robust solution to this demand. The hardware and software systems must allow for several MIE calculations to be run concurrently and results of these calculations to subsequently undergo a process of concatenation/compilation to achieve final configurational entropy estimates.</p>
<p>The computational system must allow ongoing calculations to be stopped and then restarted due to unexpected events (e.g. prolonged power failure, system updates that require rebooting, etc.) or software upgrades that provide significant increases in efficiency. All these factors may result in the output being significantly fragmented but salvageable. In order to avoid possible human error in the concatenation/compilation process, it must be highly automated to obtain final MIE NN based entropy estimations.</p>
<p>Lastly, the software system underlying the MIE-NN method of configurational entropy estimation is ready to be incorporated into a computer platform publically available to computational physicists, chemists, and biologists. This is a major goal of this contract.<br />2. As a specific extension of previous collaborations with our collaborators, a protein structure that meets NIOSH mission needs has been identified. This addresses the need to develop the MIE-NN approach in a biologically natural receptor-ligand system. It is the estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#61537;) protein. This system meets needs to have a computationally tractable model to elucidate important methodological issues still inherent to validating the MIE-NN approach; and it will contribute significantly to practical needs to estimate binding affinities for molecular systems with potential toxicities. The molecular dynamics simulation of positional and energetic states is currently in progress, and remains to be monitored and completed during the course of this contract.</p>
<p>In addition, MIE-NN calculations for the dipyridyl/ethyleneurea model system are to be concluded. <br /><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Reference 2010-77967, CDC NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or e-mail to RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV or FAX to 304-285-6083. Phone 304-285-5880. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with the&nbsp;University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, Dept 621, La Jolla, CA 92093-0621 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of grating-based integrated circuit layout design and patterning. The goal of the Gratings of Regular Arrays and Trim Exposures (GRATE) program is to develop revolutionary new circuit design methodologies combined with grating-based lithography tools to enable cost effective low volume nanofabrication for Department of Defense (DoD) applications. The novel circuit design methodologies will enable simplified physical layout implementation of circuits by leveraging extremely regular geometries. Overall circuit densities and performance will not be sacrificed when utilizing these new design approaches. These simplified circuit design geometries will be implemented using ultra-high-resolution grating patterns which can be fabricated at high throughput using either mask-based or maskless (interference) lithography. Cost effective low volume microfabrication will be achieved by lowering the design and fabrication costs of custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), enabling maskless interference-based patterning with practical throughputs, and improving fabrication yield resulting from regular circuit patterns.  See the full DARPA-BAA-10-12 document attached.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to substantially improve the design, integration/manufacturing, and verification of complex cyber-physical systems, and particularly aerospace and defense systems such as aircraft, rotorcraft, and ground vehicles. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in this area. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. The proposed effort will culminate with the development of a complex advanced air and/or ground platform employing the new approach and demonstrating dramatic improvement in development time (and ultimately level of effort and cost).
<p>The ultimate goal of the META program is to make a dramatic improvement on the existing systems engineering, integration, and testing process for defense systems. META is not predicated on one particular alternative approach, metric, technique, or tool. Broadly speaking, however, it aims to develop model-based design methods for cyber-physical systems far more complex and heterogeneous than those to which such methods are applied today; to combine these methods with a rigorous deployment of hierarchical abstractions throughout the system architecture; to optimize system design with respect to an observable, quantitative measure of complexity for the entire cyber-physical systems; and to apply probabilistic formal methods to the system verification problem, thereby dramatically reducing the need for expensive real-world testing and design iteration.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC proposes to enter into a contract with University of Kansas, Center forRemote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS)on a sole source basis utilizing American Recoveryand Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds to provide NASA with a unique, custom built anddesigned cryospheric radar suite which includes three radars necessary for mapping thebed topography of ice sheets, determining snow thickness on sea ice and monitoring thenear surface firn layers on ice sheets. These radars are necessary to meet Operation IceBridges science objectives and is the only radar suite that is adapted to fly on theNASA P-3 (a propeller airplane) and DC-8 (a jet airplane).  This procurement action willrequire CReSIS to deploy, operate and maintain their custom built suite of  three radarsfor the Operation Ice Bridge Greenland 2010 aircraft campaign which will begin in March2010. The Greenland campaign is a series of flights designed to monitor the dynamic areasof the arctic sea ice and Greenland ice sheet during the data gap between ICESat-1 andICESat-2, which will not launch until the 2014 timeframe.  The Cryosphere, including landice and sea ice are essential areas to monitor in a warming climate. This requirementalso includes the processing of the radar data by CReSIS with their custom processingalgorithms and the release of Level 1-B (geolocated radar echograms)data to the IceBridge Science Team three months after the completion of the campaign.	NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from University of Kansas, Center for RemoteSensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS).  CReSIS has already gathered data for Operation IceBridge in the Antarctic 2009 Campaign.	No other University or Company has the uniquecustom built three radar suite of instruments developed by CReSIS which includes thecapabilities of imaging fast flowing, rapidly changing glaciers, snow thickness on seaice and near surface firn over the ice sheets.	CReSIS has unique UHF (Ultrahigh-frequency)and VHF (Very high-frequency) airborne radars for imaging the near surfacefirn and snow depth on sea ice at a very high vertical resolution (5 cm). Because CReSIShas designed, developed and built these one of a kind instruments for cryosphericapplications and adapted them to the NASA planes, they are the only qualified personnelto operate the instruments in the field and are the only qualified personnel to repairthe instruments.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

Using the AIRgrav (Airborne Inertially reference Gravimeter) system,operated by Sander Geophysics Laboratory (SGL), the drape flying that is necessary forthe Ice Bridge campaign to support collection of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) andradar measurements is achieved. This data is essential to understand ocean-iceinteractions and the expected future sea level rise from ice sheets.  This action willrequire LDEO to coordinate with SGL, deploy and operate the AIRgrav system for theOperation Ice Bridge Greenland 2010 aircraft campaign which will begin in March 2010. TheGreenland campaign is a series of flights designed to monitor the dynamic areas of thearctic sea ice and Greenland ice sheet during the data gap between ICESat-1 and ICESat-2,which will not launch until the 2014 timeframe.  The Cryosphere, including land ice andsea ice are essential areas to monitor in a warming climate. The Greenland campaign willalso measure the gravity field in order to estimate the thickness of the water layerbeneath the floating ice tongues that are critical for the stability of ice sheets. Thisrequirement also includes the processing of the gravity data by LDEO with their customprocessing algorithms and release of data Level 2 (georeferenced gravity measurements)data to the Ice Bridge Science Team three months after the completion of the campaign.NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of ColumbiaUniversity (LDEO).  The AIRGrav system is the only gravimeter worldwide that can collectedata in draped flight mode, where the aircraft follows the surface terrain providing thehighest resolution gravity over short wavelengths that are critical for the glaciologicalanalysis done by LDEO.	 LDEO is the only university providing gravity data at theresolution needed to conduct glaciological studies to determine the thickness of thewater layer beneath floating ice tongues that cannot be achieve with ice-penetratingradar systems.	LDEO has already gathered data for Operation Ice Bridge in Antarcticaduring the Fall 2009 campaign. The AIRGrav system was capable of imaging a sill beneathPine Island Glacier that has been previously discovered by a British AutoSub, yet hadnever been mapped fully until the use of the AIRGrav system during the Antarcticacampaign.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon January 2, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NOTE  this synopsis follows a Sources Sought notice that was released on May 7, 2009 under Solicitation Number SS-PCPSB-95026-26.  A second, revised Sources Sought notice was released on August 18, 2009 to provide additional details regarding the requirement.  The August 18, 2009 notice was amended on August 19, 2009 to provide additional clarification.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) is planning to award a contract for a program entitled, Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS).   The required service is defined as code 541910 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).    

The Contractor will work with NCI program staff to provide support in planning, conducting, and analyzing the fourth administration of the Health Information National Trends Survey.  This survey will assess trends in the publics use of health information in an environment of rapidly changing communication and informatics options, and will allow the NCI extramural community access to the data for conducting hypothesis-generating research into the relationship between health information, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.  The Contractor must possess sufficient technical, scientific, and operational capabilities for engaging in national surveillance efforts.     

     Survey Design: The Contractor shall, in consultation with the NCI Contracting Officers Technical Representative, develop a Survey Design Plan for a national sampling frame for the American public that will result in approximately 14,000 interviews of adults aged 18 years or older.

     Instrument Design: Using previous iterations of the HINTS questionnaire as a base, while anticipating some changes in content, the Contractor shall develop, revise, format, and finalize an instrument that is designed to elicit valid responses, based on discussions with the Contracting Officers Technical Representative. The instrument will be designed as a series of topical modules that can be organized into a series of survey instruments that the majority of respondents can complete in 30 minutes or less, and that is appropriate for the selected mode(s) of administration. The Contractor will be responsible for developing both a Spanish and an English language version of the instruments.

     Preparation of Materials for OMB Clearance: The Contractor, in consultation with the Contracting Officers Technical Representative, shall develop and then produce the required paper copies, as well as electronic copies, of all necessary documentation to be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for administrative clearance of HINTS data collection under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

     Pretest of Survey Instrument: The survey instrument (including all potential modes of delivery and topic modules) shall be cognitively tested on a sample of English-speaking and Spanish-speaking respondents: to elicit accurate responses to each item, to demonstrate that the instrument and general survey approach are designed to obtain adequate responses, and to ensure that the questions can be answered in the time budgeted for the survey.

     Interviewer Hiring and Training: If the proposed survey design involves the use of telephone interviewers, the Contractor shall provide the services of a sufficient number of trained interviewers and other necessary personnel to complete the required number of interviews, and other data collection efforts, within the specified time frame.

     Data Collection Procedures: The Contractor shall make use of procedures that are agreed upon by the Contractor Project Director and the NCI Contracting Officers Technical Representative to constitute best practices in the conduct of sample surveys. NCI recognizes that response rates to surveys are declining, so the Contractor is encouraged to consider any and all mechanisms, including notification letters, monetary reimbursement or other incentives, or alternative modes of data collection (e.g., mixed mode interviews involving the combination of telephone interviews with mail or Internet surveys) to obtain an acceptable response rate. 

     Data Management: The Contractor shall develop and implement a system to be used to code, edit, clean, and verify and store data as they are collected. Monthly progress reports shall include updates and evaluations of the survey operation, development of the analytical plan, and complete tabular summaries of the interview data as appropriate. At the end of data collection, the Contractor shall provide the NCI a clean file containing data from the interviews and the necessary weighting vectors to enable analyses of data from complex sample surveys. With the final data file, the Contractor shall also supply a data kit containing hardcopy and electronic documentation that includes: a list of variables, codes, coding rules, edit specifications, edit flags, notes describing any problems with data, and a data dictionary.

     Data Analysis: Data analysis activities will be conducted in collaboration with the Contracting Officers Technical Representative to support the information needs of data users and results users. Analytic activities will include creating a spreadsheet of metadata values to support the development of an online informatics application. The Contractor will be required to create the standardized, electronic coding structures that will be needed to make display of the HINTS data available through the NCI cancer Bioinformatics Grid (caBIG  https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/).

     Dissemination: The Contractor shall be responsible for creating and delivering a communication/dissemination plan for promoting use of HINTS data and products.

The NCI intends to award a cost-reimbursement contract with a period of performance of four years.  The Government intends to have a full & open competition for this requirement in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This synopsis is not an RFP; an RFP is anticipated for release on or about January 8, 2010 through Federal Business Opportunities (http://fbo.gov/).    

Questions regarding this requirement must be submitted in writing and directed to Stacy Hollis at holliss@mail.nih.gov.  The reference number to be used for this announcement is RFP N02-PC-95026-26.  All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided.

AMDR will consist of an S-band radar (AMDR-S), an X-band radar (AMDR-X) and a Radar Suite Controller (RSC).  The AMDR-S will provide volume search, tracking, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) discrimination, and missile communications.  The AMDR-X will provide horizon search, precision tracking, missile communication and terminal illumination. Both radars will be integrated into a suite by the RSC.  The RSC will provide the appropriate interfaces between the AMDR-S, AMDR-X, and combat system.  The RSC will perform all coordinating actions to ensure that both radars operate in concert in a widely diverse environment.  This solicitation will address the AMDR-S and RSC technology development of the AMDR suite through a Technology Development Review (TDR) and a Preliminary Design Review (PDR).
IMPORTANT:  In order to be considered for contract award, each company must have a TOP SECRET facility clearance and must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary.  However, foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. primes contractors.  The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and requires the issuance of an export license by the U.S. Department of State. 
There will be classified attachments at the SECRET/US Only level to the solicitation.  These classified documents will be supplied on a CD/DVD which will be mailed separately.  Only one copy of the classified CD/DVD will be distributed per cleared pre-solicitation notice respondent.  To obtain these classified attachments, interested offerors must completely fill out the "Classified Material Request Form" which is attached to this pre-solicitation notice.  This information should be submitted to Brian Wessmiller via e-mail at brian.wessmiller@navy.mil with a copy to richelle.wright@navy.mil and mike.kilbane@navy.mil.  Once approved, the Government will be able to mail a classified CD/DVD to the respondent if a solicitation is issued.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Expressions of Interest Sought 
Rockville, Maryland


The United States Government currently occupies approximately 82,873 BOMA rentable square feet (brsf) of office and related space at 6100 Executive Boulevard., Rockville, MD under a lease that will be expiring.  The Government has a continuing need for the above stated space requirement.  

The Government is seeking to lease approximately 82,873 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 74,300 of contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for five (5) years  with cancellation rights beginning on the second (2rd) anniversary date of the lease.  The space must be available for occupancy by September 21, 2010.  

Delineated Area:

North: Halpine Road to Twinbrook Parkway
East: Viers Mill Road to Connecticut Avenue 
West: East Jefferson Street, Rollins Avenue, Evelyn Dr., Montrose Road, Tadenwood Drive, Old Stage Road, Tilden Park, Tuckerman Lane I-270, Democracy Blvd., Old Georgetown Road, Wisconsin Avenue.

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.  The offered space must be near inexpensive and moderately priced fast food and/or eat-in restaurants.  Other employee services such as retail shops, cleaners, and banks shall be located within 1 mile.  The offered space must meet GSA requirements for security, seismic, and fire protection and life safety and handicapped accessibility (ABAAS).  

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.

Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and must include the following information:

	Building name and address.

	Rentable Square Feet (RSF) available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.

ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced .

	Method of rentable space measurement.

	Name, address, telephone number, and email address of Owners Representative.

	Owners name and address and written statement from owner identifying Owners Representative and granting it authority to provide information on the property.

	Parking Availability

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  The Governments decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.  In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the potential building in question cannot meet the Governments requirements.  With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume the maximum rental rate authorized in the applicable lease prospectus related to this requirement in the event the respondent fails to include such information.

Background:1.	The Emerging Health Technologies (EHT) team is tasked with identifying and assessing emerging health IT technologies and practices as potential candidates for improving the quality and efficiency of VHA healthcare.  EHT facilitates entrepreneurial investment for incubation and/or direct research and prototyping; builds relationships with industry and other private and Government entities; produces trending reports and provides a technical briefing service for audiences ranging from business and technical to executive.  A particular focus of the EHT team is to support VHA stakeholder investigations into the use of technology that offers the promise of improving support to VHA's healthcare lines of business.  Recent organizational changes have affected the historically close working relationship between clinical and software development staffs and there is a strong desire within VHA to enhance the ability of the field to introduce innovation into clinical practice.  As a result, the EHT team has partnered with the Innovation Program Office within the Health and Medical Informatics Office and the Office of Information and Technology to acquire tools and services to provide a collaborative environment called the 'Innovation Sandbox.'   II.	Scope: 1.	The Innovation Sandbox will be a virtual and transparent environment, eventually accessible to any VA employee or Contractor with a network account.  The Innovation Sandbox will be used for a range of activities including collaborative development of ideas, requirements, models and software.   The virtual nature of the Innovation Sandbox will support communities of interest, irrespective of organizational alignment or physical location, and strengthen early idea sharing and maturation leading to the identification of promising solutions to business concerns and requirements definition that represent enterprise needs.  Consequently, the environment is expected to allow VHA to enrich its tradition of field-based innovation as well as facilitate more rapid deployment of mature software that adheres to national development standards.2.	The Innovation Sandbox will be introduced in stages.  The first phase will be a pilot with a limited number of users and projects and is expected to last approximately four months.   In preparation for the pilot, the software tools will be installed and configured, governance will be established, and users and pilot projects will be identified.  Ongoing support for the pilot will afford VHA an opportunity to improve and enhance the environment before transitioning it to production status.  The production phase is expected to begin approximately six months after contract award.3.	 The Contractor shall supply collaborative tools software and services to provide, administer and sustain an integrated collaborative environment.  The Contractor will also assess and document opportunities to expand and strengthen the administration and operation of the program. 4.	 Initial efforts are focused largely on getting delivery of the pilot environment first followed by the production environment.  The first three task areas below reflect the categories of work that will be done to provide and sustain the operational environment.  Subsequent contract activity, however, is expected to fall primarily in the fourth area below and requirements will emerge as VHA garners experience working in a collaborative environment.   Tasks in this category will inform the administrative and management aspects of the collaborative tools environment (e.g., design challenge options) that will help attract users to the environment, facilitate their work, and ultimately provide VHA with a positive return on its investment.a.	Self-organization and sustainment of communities of interest;b.	Full lifecycle management of idea management, knowledge sharing; c.	Distributed software development management (e.g., configuration management, issue tracking, assignment tracking and bug reporting); andd.	Assessment and documentation of administrative and operations opportunities such as development of standard operating guides and increasing program awareness through a variety of communication methods. 5.	VHA has established a high-level Capability List for the Innovation Sandbox program.  Paragraph 6 expands upon this list with a set of Core Goals.  The numbers in parentheses in the list below represent a mapping to the Core Goals in paragraph 6.  The desired Capabilities are as follows: a.	Ability to support self-organization.

<DESC>POC:  Mr. James Brown, telephone 703-704-1205, email: james.wesley.brown1@us.army.mil<BR><BR>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) and product samples.  This is not an Invitation to Bid nor a Request for Proposals.  There is currently no acquisition funding available for this effort. However, Product Manager Soldier Maneuver Sensors (PM SMS) has a requirement to conduct a Product Evaluation Test (PET) for the Crew Served Weapons Light (CSWL), a component of the Army Family of Flashlights, to qualify sources for the U.S. Army. This is a market survey to identify any manufacturers who have commercially available CSWLs that will interface with current weapon systems in the Army inventory; the M2 Series Heavy Machine Gun and the MK-19 MOD III Grenade Machine Gun. There is also an emerging requirement for the CSWL to interface with the Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station (CROWS). While sources are sought that can provide Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items that are already in production, Non Developmental Items (NDIs) that can be delivered for comparative testing by 8 March 2010 are also acceptable. Six samples will be required for the PET process along with operation and mounting training and technical documentation.  PM SMS requests that interested parties submit six product samples and one set of the necessary technical data to the addresses given under Responses below by 8 March 2010. On 11 or 12 March 2010, it is further requested that respondents provide operation and mounting training to the test personnel at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. Responses will be limited to one product model per vendor. The samples will be tested in accordance with the requirements described under PET System Requirements below and will be returned following testing along with final test results for each product. Units that perform well during the PET and are competitively priced will be placed on the Armys Approved Family of Flashlights List (AFFL) and will be entitled to display the AFFL sticker on their approved product.<BR><BR>CSWL Mounting Requirements Familiarization Exhibit:<BR><BR>To help vendors prepare to participate in the PET, PM SMS will sponsor a CSWL Mounting Requirements Familiarization Exhibit at the Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD on 11 through 15 January 2010. Participation in the familiarization exhibit is strictly voluntary.<BR><BR>Each vendor will be given a dedicated block of time to familiarize themselves with the M-2 and MK-19 weapons in both the mounted configuration with the Objective Gunner Protective Kit (O-GPK) and the dismounted configuration with a machine gun tripod mount. Further, they will see how the CSWL must mount on the weapons when a thermal sight and an aiming laser are also on the weapon. If possible, there will also be a CROWS for evaluation. They will be given the opportunity to mount their CSWLs on the weapons in the various configurations; however, there will be no live firings of the weapons. It is mainly an exhibit for the vendors to get hands-on experience with the CSWL mounting requirements. Technical experts from ATC will be available to answer questions.<BR><BR>The familiarization exhibit will be open to all vendors. However, because the exhibit time is limited, those wishing to attend must contact PM SMS for reservations and scheduling. Vendors should be prepared to provide the following information:<BR><BR>1.

RECOVERY FUNDS
Solicitation #AG-3151-S-10-0004

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a request for proposal. The USDA, Farm Service Agency has a requirement for a contractor with specialized experience in Data Warehouse Development. This market research is for information and planning purposes only to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources capable of performing the work described to see if there are an adequate number of interested and qualified vendors having the capabilities and experience in a data warehousing environment supporting large mission critical, multi-platform systems; providing time critical customer support; performing effective production problem resolution; and a proactive approach to ensuring maximum system availability and data integrity.  This sources sought shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.

This Sources Sought Notice is issued under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Farm Service (FSA).

A sources sought is being conducted to determine if there are adequate small business contractors available for the proposed project that meets the specific criteria outlined below. This is NOT a solicitation announcement or request for proposal. This does not constitute any commitment by the Government; no award will result from this notice. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make an appropriate acquisition decision. Respondents will NOT be notified of the results of this notice. Interested contractors are asked to provide their capability statements that focus on data warehouse development efforts completed, or substantially completed, within the last five years.  This information will be used to determine if FSA will set-aside this effort to small business.  

After completing an analysis of the responses, the Government will determine whether to limit competition to small business set aside, or to proceed inviting full and open competition. FSA anticipates using an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with a performance work statement that will break the effort down into finite tasks that will be fixed price and ordered as needed.
________________________________________
Reference Number:  Include Reference Number AG-3151-S-10-0004 on your submission.

Place of Performance:  The Place of performance will be primarily located in Kansas City, Missouri. 

Period of Performance:  The anticipated period of performance is 5 years with development effort beginning in March 2010 and transitioning to maintenance only in approximately 2.5 years. 

Scope of Services

Data Mart Migration
FSA has a need to migrate approximately 22 existing data marts from a legacy platform to a new platform and fully document the resulting data marts.  Documentation and migration shall address all aspects of each data mart, including database, batch jobs to load the database, and reporting applications that access the database.

Documentation requirements for each data mart include accurate:
	metadata populated in a metadata repository
	physical data models
	flow diagrams showing the complete flow and transformation of data from the originating source to the target (Source systems are on a multitude of platforms including the Mainframe, Centralized Web Farm, and AS400 / System/36 computers in approximately 2300 field offices.)

The current data mart architecture consists of an Informix database management system, end user reporting via Hyperion, and a multitude of technologies (Unix scripts, Informix utilities, DataStage scripts, and a few C programs) for batch jobs to load the database.  Data files to be loaded into the data mart databases are delivered to a centralized staging server.  Routines used to get the data to the centralized staging server do not need to be converted, but must be documented as identified in the documentation requirements.

The new data mart architecture is an Oracle solution on a midrange Sun Solaris hardware platform consisting of Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE), Oracle Data Integrator (ODI), and Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE).  

New Reporting Data Marts
In addition to the migrations, FSA anticipates a requirement for creating several new reporting data marts to relieve performance issues against production application databases.  This will involve the full lifecycle development of new data marts to move the reporting being performed against the application databases to data marts within the warehouse.

Place of Performance:  The Place of performance will be primarily located in Kansas City, Missouri. 

Period of Performance:  The anticipated period of performance is 2 years with the base effort to validate current state assessments and create the to-be data strategy.


FSA requires an enterprise data strategy to plan for improving the way the agency leverages its data, allowing the government to turn data into information and knowledge which, in turn, will produce measurable improvements in business performance and optimizes the way the agency fulfills its mission. The agency mission is to equitably serve all farmers, ranchers, and agricultural partners by delivering effective, efficient agricultural programs for all Americans.  The agency supports four major program areas (Farm Loans, Income Support and Disaster Assistance, Conservation, and Commodity Operations) with approximately 90 systems. 

The enterprise data strategy is a critical aspect of FSAs overall approach to strategic information technology. The enterprise data strategy will encompass enterprise data architecture, enterprise data management, and an enterprise analytic capability, along with action plans or roadmaps for implementation.  The enterprise data architecture will focus on data structure, storage, access, and movement of data throughout the enterprise.  The architecture will include current state assessments composed of business domain models, data analysis and definition, data relationships, identification of authoritative data sources, and data flows.  The architecture will include future state models depicting the to-be data architecture for FSA modernization initiatives and will include master data, metadata, data security, data retention and deletion policies, business process integration, design standards and guidelines, configuration management and capacity planning, and data taxonomy.  

The architecture will include a gap analysis and transition plans to be used as the roadmap for attaining the future state. The key components of enterprise data management are data governance and data quality.  Data governance will include data policies and procedures, access rights management, governance processes, change management, workflow and collaboration, definition of data producers and consumers, data owners, data stewards, a data governance council, data rules library, and identity and access management technology.  Data quality will focus on metrics management, data standards and rules, data cleansing standards, ETL, data monitoring, and audit reports. Enterprise analytic capability is based on business intelligence and will include query and reporting, research and analysis, business process flows, metrics management and KPIs, multi-dimensional analysis, data mining and analytics tools, enterprise data warehouse functionality, and a BI competency center with a BI tool suite

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
Programmatic and transactional legal services are being sought to support the Department of Energy's Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program (the "Title XVII Program").  The Title XVII Program consists of the following Credit Programs: (i) a Self-Pay Title XVII Program under Section 1703 in which borrowers are required to pay the subsidy cost of the DOE loan guarantee and (ii) a Rapid Deployment Program under Section 1705 in which appropriated funds have been made available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act") to pay such subsidy cost.  Moreover, the Financial Institution Partnership Program ("FIPP") implements part of the Rapid Deployment Program and is intended to expand credit capacity for the efficient and prudent financing of eligible projects that use commercial energy-related technologies, while also assuring a proper alignment of risks between DOE and private sector financial institutions, privately-owned and managed investment vehic les (including funds) and/or Development Finance Organizations ("DFOs").  The first FIPP solicitation utilizes a syndicated lending model, and the FIPP may be developed to include components that involve the provision of DOE loan guarantees to privately owned and managed investment vehicles (including funds) and/or to DFOs.  DOE expects to separately seek legal counsel with respect to each specific loan guarantee transaction under the Self-Pay Title XVII Program and certain components of the Rapid Deployment Program, such as the project-by-project negotiation of the formation and governing documents for loan portfolio model transactions. 
Under the Title XVII Program, DOE's loan guarantee supports energy or energy-related projects such as the following ("Energy or Energy-Related Projects"):
a. Renewable Energy Systems, including incremental hydropower, that generates electricity or thermal energy, and facilities that manufacture related componentsb. Advanced Fossil Energy Technology, including coal gasification meeting certain statutory criteria (e.g., emission levels)c. Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology (e.g., residential, industrial or transportation applications)d. Advanced Nuclear Energy Facilitiese. Front-End of the Fuel Cycle Nuclear Facilitiesf. Carbon Capture and Sequestration Practices and Technologies (e.g., agricultural and forestry practice that store and sequester carbon)g. Efficient Electrical Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Technologiesh. Efficient End-Use Energy Technologiesi. Production Facilities for Fuel Efficient Vehicles (e.g., hybrid and advanced diesel vehicles)j. Pollution Control Equipmentk. Refineries, meaning facilities at which crude oil is refined into gasolinel. Electric Power Transmission Systems, including upgrading and reconductoring projectsm. Leading edge biofuel projects that will use technologies performing at the pilot or demonstration scale that the Secretary determines are likely to become commercial technologies and will produce transportation fuels that substantially reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to other transportation fuels         
The firm will, inter alia, work with the Title XVII Program: 
(1) to provide overarching programmatic legal services which will consist of conducting analyses; preparing basic/template transactional documentation and other documentation necessary to implement each Credit Program (including loan agreement, security documents and related term sheets, as well as investment vehicle (including funds) formation and governing documents); developing programmatic recommendations, including with respect to advising on individual transactions, privately owned and managed investment vehicles (including funds) and laws applicable to investment funds, DFO participation and the design of a program for implementing and complying with the newly enacted Davis Bacon Act requirement for all Title XVII projects; assisting in any rulemakings and drafting or commenting on portions of DOE loan guarantee solicitations; advising on all aspects of the Title XVII Program that relate to structuring, documenting, implementing and/or designing any component of the ap plicable Credit Program; representing DOE, under the direction of OCC, before other government agencies, such as the Federal Financing Bank, and export credit agencies; advising on transactions, and on a post-closing basis, to the extent programmatic issues are implicated in particular transactions;  
(2) to review pre-applications and applications and any legal aspects of responses by DFOs to DOE requests for information or invitations, negotiate, structure, document, review and comment on third-party opinions and give opinions on behalf of DOE as guarantor, advise on all matters of local law, local security documentation, or jurisdiction-specific legal issues such as local land use, permitting, tax and real property laws and effectuating security interests contemplated, and close loan guarantee transactions in connection with stand-alone projects under the Title XVII Program, particularly in syndicated loan transactions with private sector financial institutions participating in the FIPP component of the Rapid Deployment Program; 
(3) to negotiate, structure, document and close amendments, modifications and waivers to existing loans, including in restructuring, defaults, insolvencies and bankruptcy contexts, and provide legal advice to DOE in all aspects of bankruptcy proceedings under applicable Federal and local state law in consultation, as appropriate, with other U.S. Government agencies, such as the Department of Justice.

<DESC>RECOVERY -&nbsp; THIS&nbsp;IS&nbsp;NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS OR PROPOSALS. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES.&nbsp; INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.&nbsp; THIS ORDER IS FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.<br />The Sources Sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. Any procurement that may result from this notice will be funded, in whole, or in part, by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) of 2009. No solicitation is currently available, and no unsolicited proposals will be entertained as a result of this Sources Sought notice. As a result of this market research, if at least two qualified small businesses are identified the resulting competitive procurement will be conducted as a small business set-aside.&nbsp; The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541690; the small business size standard is $7 million. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking to identify those sources with the requisite qualifications and capabilities necessary to fully develop and execute a Health Information Technology (HIT) Standards Analysis project, as detailed below.<br /><br />The Health IT Standards Analysis Project supports the broader NIST Healthcare IT Testing Infrastructure Project. The objective of the Health IT Standards Analysis project is to focus resources on specific, national priority standards needs in the healthcare community to further clinical information exchange among providers, consumers, public health and other stakeholders. This project does not seek to select the standards that should be used by the healthcare community; it seeks to analyze those standards deemed appropriate by the healthcare community by objectively determining the maturity, robustness, testability and suitability of a particular standard for use (i.e., is it free from ambiguities, errors, inconsistencies, omissions, and to the extent possible, meet intended requirements). Additionally this project seeks to develop appropriate test material, data and standard-specific test tools for high priority national need standards for interoperability.
<p>Contractors are asked to develop:</p>
<p>&bull; a standard's suitability analysis, <br />&bull; conformance/interoperability testing material, <br />&bull; conformance/interoperability test data set, and <br />&bull; conformance/interoperability testing tool(s)</p>
<p>For health IT standard(s) supporting a health IT focus (defined below as Task Areas). Each task may be awarded individually or a Contractor can group task areas. This provides the flexibility for NIST to award multiple contracts to this SOW for focused healthcare domain specific expertise.</p>
<p>Contractors should consider the health IT and IT standards that will help support the goals of interoperability, security and quality in the healthcare domain. The term standards used above should be considered to include documentary specifications, profiles, interoperability specifications, constructs, implementation guides and certification criteria as used in any health IT-relevant, consensus-based private or public activity or organization. This would include standards referenced by the ANSI Health IT Standards Panel, (http://www.hitsp.org); include standards that may support federal efforts such as the Meaningful Use recommended standards and criteria, the Nationwide Health Information Network and other federal efforts focused on population health, public health, and clinical research; and include standards that may be significant in meeting the health IT standards priorities defined by the HHS/Office of the National Coordinator (see http://healthit.hhs.gov).</p>
<p>HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />The following information must be included in responses to the sources sought notice:<br />1. Provide a clear and concise narrative of current capabilities that will meet the needs of this effort.<br />2. Provide your organization's information (company name, address, business size, point of contact, telephone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail address)<br />3. Please identify the company's codes for NAICS.<br />4. Identify current General Supply Agency (GSA) contracts.<br />NIST encourages responses from all responsible sources, including, but not limited to, small businesses, interested sources that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project, should submit responses to this notice by electronic mail to Ms. Salina C. Alexander, Support Contractor/Senior Acquisition Specialist, at Salina.Alexander@nist.gov, with "CC" to Ms. Wanza B. Jonjo, at Wanza.Jonjo@nist.gov. Responses must be sent to arrive into inboxes, to the email addresses provided above, no later 3:00pm, EST, on January 6th, 2010. <br /></p>

<DESC>Sources Sought <br />
<p>The National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division (ESRL/GMD) (hereinafter referred to as the Government) located in Boulder, Colorado is currently conducting market research to determine sources for a one handed balloon launch pay out reel or unwinder with 120 feet of string to support up to 5.5 pound packages of ozonesonde and water vapor instrumentation. The launch reel is a ratchet device that connects the instrumentation package to the balloon that lets out about 120 feet of string at around 1 foot per second after the balloon has been launched to increase the distance between the balloon borne package and the balloon during the ascent. This allows one person to easily launch the balloon package without having to handle a long line at the surface when attempting to launch the balloon.  A typical balloon launch component list from top to bottom would be balloon, parachute, payout reel, then instrumentation. The balloon launch reel would be expendable and travel with the balloon.</p>
<p>A picture of a legacy unit can be obtained in the attachments (package) to this notice or by contacting Bill Cushman at bill.cushman@noaa.gov or (303) 497-6072 that meets the Government's requirements. The Government is not committed to any one design and will entertain all designs that meet the requirements listed below.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates award of a contract for approximately 300 balloon launch payout reels per year as a 1-year base period contract followed by three 1-year option periods. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 332618 (Other Fabricated Wire Product Manufacturing) and the small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background:<br />A reliable balloon launch reel is critical when considering the value of the payload it is assisting in launching. Each ozonesonde launch costs approximately $700. When a water vapor sensor is added to the suite, the cost is $2,600. If a balloon launch reel fails or slips and allows the payload to fall, the typical result is the sensors smashing into the ground and breaking without possibility of repair.</p>
<p>Draft Statement of Work Requirements:<br />The Contractor shall provide a system that have all the following features and/or meet the following minimum description/performance requirements:<br />1.  120 feet of payout string / string diameter of at least 0.031 inches / string test strength of at least 50 pounds<br />2.  One handed operation <br />3.  Must be able to support 5.5 pounds<br />4.  Overall weight of apparatus must be below .5 pounds<br />5.  Maximum string payout rate must not exceed 2ft/second</p>
<p>RFI Instructions:<br />This is not a solicitation; it is only a Request for Information (RFI). The purpose of the RFI is to determine (1) whether there are sources capable of satisfying the Government's requirements and (2) to determine whether these services are provided by the commercial market. No proposals are being requested or accepted under this synopsis.</p>
<p>Interested sources must provide information regarding their capabilities to provide balloon launch reels that meet the above requirements. At a minimum, responders shall submit the following information:<br />(1) Statement explaining how the responder's balloon payout reel meets the requirements; <br />(2) Provide DUNS or CAGE number.</p>
<p>NOAA will consider all comments, supportive or critical, but may or may not use these individual comments. Qualification statements will be treated separately from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposals. NOAA will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. NOAA, as noted above, is assessing the existence of sources and is requesting written comments from industry on the attached requirements. Written comments or e-mail messages shall be received no later than 4:00PM Mountain Standard Time, Thursday, December 31, 2009. Sources interested in providing comments shall respond in writing to Bill Cushman, GMD, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305. Submittals may also be sent by e-mail to bill.cushman@noaa.gov. Telephone responses are not acceptable. This notice is not a Request for Proposals, Invitation for Bids, or Request for Quotes. It is a Request for Information and is part of the Government's market research process.</p>

<DESC>Document Type:  Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI)<BR>Solicitation Number:  W900KK-09-R-0002<BR>Response Date:  1600 hours (EST), 13 February, 2009<BR>Classification Code: 6910<BR>Set-Aside:  NA<BR>NAICS Code 333319<BR>Estimated Value:  $500M<BR>Period of Performance:  One year base plus four-one year options.<BR>Anticipated Place of Performance:  CONUS & OCONUS  <BR><BR>Title:  Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Single Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Live Training Contract.  <BR><BR>Description:  PEO STRI Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manger for Digitized Training (DT) anticipates numerous live training requirements for instrumentation and associated equipment, spares, training, and maintenance support for Integrated Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) Training Systems (IMTS), Mobile MOUT, and Combat Training Center MOUT Instrumentation System (CTC MOUT-IS) under Urban Operations. <BR> <BR> The intent of Urban Operations is to provide dynamic, modular and scalable solutions to fulfill various aspects of individual, collective, and combined arms training.  Urban Operations encompasses more than traditional going-to-war training; it also addresses other-than-war operations (such as peacekeeping missions), and homeland defense and anti-terrorism scenarios.  Urban Operations supports both fixed-permanent and non-permanent structure facilities, allows for the additional expansion to existing facilities, integration across sites and mission domains, and supports the continuation of instrumentation and data processing growth commensurate with tactical systems.  This equipment will provide an instrumentable Live Training Capability for the Soldier.  The Urban Operations environment completely immerses the training participant into the realism of the event, and it becomes indistinguishable from real life environments.  The Urban Operations environment allows and supports flexibility and changing of scenarios to prevent learned responses vice learning benefits.  The Urban Operations environment allows for the inclusion of the unexpected, unplanned, and uncontrolled events, and trains learning, not conditioning.   <BR><BR>The Integrated-Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) Training System (IMTS) consists of three training facilities/systems:  1)  the Urban Assault Course (UAC);  2) Shoot house (SH); and  3)Combined Arms Collective Training Facility (CACTF), all of which are designed to provide individual through battalion-level, homestation, and urban operations training. These new training facilities will allow units to train Soldiers on building entry and room clearing techniques under live and blank-fire conditions and limited subterranean training in an urban training facility large enough to conduct combined arms force-on-force collective training at the battalion/task force level. These urban training facilities that are located across the Army ensure that Soldiers are prepared to conduct full-spectrum operations in any urban environment. By providing state-of the-art urban training facilities capable of training todays Soldiers in a realistic urban environment, this system ensures that they have the highest level of training experience.  Lessons are learned on the training ground and not in the battle. These systems monitor and control the training exercise, process, display, and analyze collected exercise data, prepare and present standardized training performance feedback, and archive training performance information for external use. <BR> <BR> The Mobile Military Operations on Urban Terrain Training System (MOUT) is a transportable urban combat training system consisting of reconfigurable shipping containers assembled into urban structures. Urban structures are fitted with audio/video instrumentation systems, exercise control and monitoring, and After Action Review (AAR) presentation capability. Urban structures can be multi-story with interior/exterior stairwells and may include balconies and trap doors leading to subterranean storage areas or tunnel complexes. In its fully instrumented configuration, the system allows realistic battlefield effects (smoke, sounds, smells, pyrotechnics, etc.) and provides video and audio of Soldiers being trained to allow for rapid AAR.  The Mobile MOUT provides a rapidly fielded, deployable urban operations training system that allows Soldiers to improve their tactics, techniques, and procedures and to conduct mission rehearsals practicing force-on-force or force-on-target while utilizing Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES), blanks, man-marker rounds, or Short-Range Training Ammunition (SRTA).<BR><BR>The CTC MOUT-IS project initially provides the National Training Center National Urban Warfare Complex (NTC NUWC) with an instrumentation system to support 200 - 400 urban structures.  The instrumentation will include audio/video instrumentation systems, exercise control and monitoring, and after action review editing, production, and presentation capability.  In FY12 the project then shifts to tech refresh of the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) and Joint Multi-National Readiness Center (JMRC) MOUT-IS systems.<BR><BR>These systems will support the full range of Urban Operations live training requirements, from individual training to collective training at various ranges around the world.  The Government intends to award a single award ID/IQ contract in FY 2009 with a five year period of performance (one year base with four one-year options) with a Not-To-Exceed value of approximately $500 million USD.  The award of this contract will be made on a Best-Value basis.  See the Urban Operations draft statement of work for more information regarding desired capabilities.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; a market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City District has been tasked to provide river bank stabilization for the Blue River Channel, 53rd to 63rd street.<BR><BR>The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small Business Community to include Section 8(a) concerns, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB-Zone) concerns, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns to compete and perform a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Construction Contract.  The procurement will result in the award of a firm-fixed price construction contract.  <BR><BR>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction and the small business size standard is $33,500,000.00.  This project will have a magnitude of more than $10,000,000.00.<BR><BR><BR>Sample Scope of Work<BR><BR>Work to be performed includes three rock structure types plus some incidental access related work.  The Contractor must have the capability to move large rock, 42-inch in diameter, across wet floodplain and place said rock in large amounts in the Blue River channel.  There will be several access points, some with limited staging area, at widely separated work areas.  Access will require clearing a minimal number of trees, building gravel access roads, and cutting ramps in the channel banks down to the channel bottom.  A limited number of permanent culverts may be placed for these access roads.<BR><BR>The three rock structure types are rock grade control structures, rock toe revetments and rock vanes.  Rock grade control structures will be several hundred feet long and be built at least halfway up the banks.  Some excavation will be required for the grade control tailout and excavation on both sides of the floodplain, for the extended rock sills, will also be required.  Upstream of the grade controls on the outside of bends, rock toe revetments will be constructed to stabilize the toe of badly eroding channel slopes.

<DESC>Subj: Request for Information regarding Recovery Care Coordinator (RCC) Support Services required by USMC Wounded Warrior Regiment
PURPOSE:  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research for use in formulating an acquisition strategy to support the United States Marine Corps (USMC) requirement to provide Recovery Care Coordinators (RCC) to wounded, ill and injured (WII) Marines as part of the Comprehensive Recovery Plan (CRP) mandated by National Defense Appropriations Act (NDAA) 2008.  These capabilities of the USMC's Wounded Warrior Regiment (WWR) include (47) RCCs and a lead RCC Program Manager who reports to the WWR RCC Program Director.  WWR also requires the ability to increase the number of RCCs during surge periods on an as needed basis.  RCCs would be located at a variety of geographic locations across the United States including but not limited to Quantico, Virginia, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and Camp Pendleton, California.  The RCCs have the primary responsibility for oversight and assistance to recovering service members and their families for care management throughout the continuum of care from recovery through rehabilitation to the reintegration to either remain on active duty or to civilian life as a veteran.  The primary tool used for coordinating care management is the Comprehensive Recover Plan (CRP)/Comprehensive Transition Plan (CTP).  The RCC will work with medical case manager and non-medical care managers to develop and execute the CRP/CTP for each service member.  Case load will be approximately 40 service members per RCC.  
The knowledge and skills required of RCCs include, but are not limited to: supporting the programs and processes provided by DoD, DoN, Dept of Veteran Affair, Dept of Labor and other government and non-government agencies; knowledge of accessing identified benefits and ability to access benefit information from a variety of sources including, USMC specific information and benefits, Marine Corps Wounded Warrior Programs, Veterans Affairs benefits, Family Readiness Centers and National Resource Directory; and the analytical ability to access and interpret information necessary to evaluate how best to support service members and their families through the spectrum of care management, rehabilitation and transition services.
Business concerns capable of delivering an objective solution should respond with a capabilities statement addressing the following criteria:  A) Ability to establish and maintain a effective RCC program; B) Liaison with government staff and Marine Corps WWR  personnel to ensure the integrity of the program and develop quality assurance standards; D) Establish measures of performance and effectiveness to be used as quality benchmarks; and E) Ability to present analytical findings and empirical data reflecting customer satisfaction with support provided to the recovering service member and/or their family.
Responses to this RFI shall not exceed ten (10) pages, including cover letter, discussion and contact information.  Subject response must contain: (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance acumen directly related to the objectives stated; (2) Two customer citations describing similar work efforts; (3) Link to the respondent's appropriate GSA Schedules if applicable or other Government-Wide Acquisition Contract vehicles; and (4) Other material relevant to establishing the core competencies of the firm. Please identify Small Business size status if applicable.  
Response is due by Friday, January 8, 2010, 1200 a.m., EST. Please submit e-mail responses to Bradford L. Backus, Customer Liaison, at email address: bradford.backus@usmc.mil.
NOTES:  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation whatsoever on the part of the Government to procure these services or to issue a solicitation.  The Marine Corps is neither seeking proposals nor accepting unsolicited proposals, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  Any information the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.  The U.S.  Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.

<DESC>ARCHITECT-ENGINEER (A/E) DESIGN SERVICES FOR PROJECTDESCRIPTION:  Furnish full A/E services for the complete design, including construction period duties, of Project 528A8-06-804, Construct Addition for Nuclear Medicine Department, at the Stratton VA in Albany, New York.POC:  Rachael M. Roney, Contract Specialist, VISN 2 Network Contracting Activity (90NCA) OFFICE ADDRESS:  Stratton VA Medical Center, 2-90NCA, 113 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY 12208CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The Stratton VA Medical Center (VA), is seeking qualified A/E Firms for award of a Firm Fixed Price Architect Engineer Contract to perform the A/E services described herein.  The applicable NAICS code will be 541310, with an applicable small business size standard of $4.5 Million. Contract award is anticipated in February 2010.  The estimated construction value of this project falls within the range of $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.SCOPE OF SERVICE:  The project includes design and construction period services for the creation of an approximately 8500 to 9000 square foot addition to the Radiation Therapy Building to relocate the Nuclear Medicine Department at the Stratton VA Medical Center.  The addition is necessary to provide space for a new PET/CT suite and to bring the Nuclear Medicine department up to VA standards.The addition will be constructed on a new foundation, adjacent to the existing Radiation Therapy Building. The addition will tie into the existing Radiation Therapy building utilities if warranted based on consideration of design factors. A functional Nuclear Medicine Department shall include two nuclear medicine scanning rooms, thyroid uptake room, radiopharmacy, cardiac stress testing room, bone densitometry room, a PET/CT suite and all necessary staff and patient support areas. Efficient workflow is essential, with sufficient clearances to easily maneuver bariatric patient beds.The PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography) suite will house one complete set of the large, complex, highly-specialized equipment. The machinery itself will be installed by a third-party vendor. Since PET scans utilize higher-energy radiopharmaceuticals than other nuclear medicine procedures, the entire suite requires additional lead shielding. The suite must include the scanner room, operator room, equipment room, at least two patient dose administration rooms, a dedicated patient toilet and a dedicated radiopharmacy. Based on VA design guides and manuals and all relevant codes, including the federal requirements for energy efficiency, the A/E shall provide design development including a proposed layout. After the approved layout is completed, the A/E shall perform all work necessary to prepare the specifications, drawings, and bidding documents for the subject project. A/E also shall provide services during the solicitation phase and construction phase.SELECTION CRITERIA:  The VA will utilize the following selection criteria in descending order of importance:  (1) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm (including a joint venture or association) with the type of services required;  (2) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and record of working together as a team; (3) Professional capacity of the firm in the designated geographic area of the project to perform work (including any specialized services) within the time limitations.  Unusually large existing workload that may limit A/E's capacity to perform project work expeditiously; (4) Past record of performance on contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs; (5) Geographic location and facilities of the working office(s) which would provide the professional services and familiarity with the area in which the project is located; (6) Demonstrated success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design; (7) Inclusion of  disabled veteran-owned consultant(s) veteran-owned consultants, minority owned consultant(s) and/or women-owned consultant(s) SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  All responding firms, including consultants to the primary firm, are required to submit one completed Standard Form 330 Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire, dated within one year of the date of this announcement.  Submit required documents no later than 3:00 PM, EST, January 21, 2010 to the Issuing Office address shown above or by e-mail to rachael.roney@va.gov.  If submitting electronically, please include the RFP number in the subject line.  This is a Full and Open Competitive Solicitation.  Responding firms, either multi-disciplined or collaborating with consultants, must demonstrate capability in healthcare architecture, interior design, surveying, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, communications, environmental, fire protection, cost estimating, specification writing, and construction surveillance skills as described herein.  Small and disadvantaged firms are encouraged to participate as a prime consultant or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  Request for Proposal No. VA528-10-RP-0044 has been assigned to this project and should be referenced on any future correspondence regarding this solicitation.  Any questions must be submitted in a Request for Information format (RFI). It must be on letterhead, have the solicitation number and name in the subject field, as well as a signature.  RFIs may be submitted via e-mail to the address given above. Please allow 48 hours for a response.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.302-2, the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of SFAE-SDR-SCIE, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: American Power Source, Inc., a small business located in Fall River, Massachusetts 02724.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available.<BR><BR>Nature and description of services or supplies required to meet agency needs:  The Government requires 650 pairs of prototype Physical Fitness Uniform (PFU) trunks which will be issued to soldiers to be worn in a User Evaluation. This effort will evaluate the draft patterns, and purchase description and ensure that the new design encompasses all the required/necessary features needed for the trunks.  It will also validate the manufacturing processes to develop a cost estimate for future procurement actions and ensure that the final design is producible in production quantities.<BR><BR>A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only responsible source available to provide these services or supplies:  This source developed the patterns, maintains the only copies, and has knowledge of all process and procedures required to produce this item. Evaluating the trunks in a field environment carries unique challenges to ensure the accuracy of data received the government would like to limit potential quality issues. This will be accomplished by using the current vendor who has working knowledge of the current system. This effort will help us verify the drawings, construction requirements and patterns to ensure they can be used in future procurements by DSCP without any issue (pattern verification).  They will verify that the designs can be produced in a full-rate production environment.   The final comments/changes from the manufacturer will be used as part of the final purchase description to be used by the procurement agency for future buys.<BR><BR>A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted: This one time research and development effort utilizes a current manufacturer utilizing their unique understanding of the current system.  The government performed an on-line search and contacted other government entities and members of industry.  No other viable option was found.<BR><BR>A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  This one time effort will be used only to obtain samples for a future user evaluation.  Based on the feedback from Soldiers, conducting this one time study will help us to determine what our performance requirements should be for an approved item, which will be cited in a final purchase description and will open competition on all future procurements.<BR><BR>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to:  steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than Noon (EST) 23 December 2009.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center -  Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Building 1, Kansas Street<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-5704

<DESC>It is the Government's intent to negotiate on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Operation, Maintenance, and Repair of the Fort Rucker Gunnery Range Complex, Fort Rucker, Alabama, with the incumbent contractor, Honeywell Technology Solutions, Incorporated for an interim three-month period 1 January through 31 March 2010, via contract modification to the existing contract DABK31-03-C-0001, in order to prevent a lapse in service. This extension has become necessary because of unanticipated delays in the pre-award process for the new competitive acquisition, which is currently issued competitively as W9124G-09-R-0002 and is extended indefinitely pending amendment and subsequent receipt of proposals. The contractor shall provide services to operate, maintain, and repair the Fort Rucker Gunnery Range Complex on a cost-plus-award-fee basis. This interim three-month period is anticipated to provide sufficient time to complete the competitive acquisition already underway. No solicitation documents exist at this time. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers from interested parties.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO UNISYS CORPORATION, FOR REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of intent to issue a new delivery order under existing contract TIRNO-D-08-00003, for the purchase of hardware upgrades - one Central Processing Unit (CPU) and one Capacity Backup feature (CBU)- to existing IRS IBM z9 mainframe processors.  The delivery order will be a firm-fixed price action issued against an existing indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract awarded to Unisys Corp., a large business.  The delivery order will be awarded to Unisys Corp. without further competition because only Unisys can provide the continuity and expert level of service the IRS requires in maintaining the security and integrity of the Tier 1 (mainframe) computing systems.  These computing systems are critical components of the IRSs tax collection infrastructure and must be available on an uninterrupted basis for processing tax returns and providing the public access to electronic filing, online tax manuals and other critical tax related activities.

The CPU and CBU being acquired will become one of hundreds of parts functioning together within each mainframe being upgraded.  Unisys has a contract with IRS to maintain these mainframes.  Introducing another vendor to provide, warrant, and maintain specific parts within those mainframes would introduce complexities and unacceptable risks into the maintenance process.  It would interfere with Unisyss ability to provide, and IRSs ability to enforce, contractually-defined service levels.

These hardware upgrades are needed to support new workloads in the IRS mainframe environment.  Mission critical tax applications will be affected by the changes implemented by ARRA such that increased volumes and changes will require additional processing resources.  The workloads include processing new Business Master File tax forms and handling increased volumes of queries to support customer interactions with the IRS for other tax application systems such as Corporate File OnLine.  This acquisition will provide the additional processor capacity needed to process these workloads.

<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) posts this notice of intent to modify Contract Number WC1330-08-CQ-0085, Task Order 0011 issued to W.S. Anderson Incorporated of Brockton, MA, an 8(a) firm under its Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract for construction services to support the National Weather Service Eastern Region, and other National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) entities. The estimated value of this action is less than $60,000.00. This action is for removal of Asbestos in the rooftop ductwork and roofing flashing at the NOAA, NMFS Laboratory, Milford, CT.</p>
<p>In September 2009, NOAA awarded Task Order 0011 against Contract Number WC1330-08-CQ-0085 to W.S. Anderson Incorporated of Brockton, MA, an 8(a) firm under its Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract for construction services to support the National Weather Service Eastern Region, and other National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) entities. The current requirement for the removal of Asbestos in the rooftop ductwork and roofing flashing is essentially follow-on work to the work that W.S. Anderson Incorporated of Brockton, MA is performing on Task Order 0011. To consider sources other than W.S. Anderson Incorporated would be inefficient and could compromise the Government's ability to meet the project completion schedule. A Contractor other than W.S. Anderson would need additional time to acquire the knowledge necessary to fully understand the Government's requirements. Thus it is in the Government's best interest to acquire the follow-on work from W.S. Anderson Incorporated.</p>
<p>This notice is for full disclosure compliance and announcement of potential subcontracting opportunities only. No competitive solicitation package is available, and no offers will be accepted from any source other than W.S.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<p>GENERAL<br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined that performance of the tasks as described in this future award requires that the Contractor, subcontractor(s), vendor(s), etc. (herein known as Contractor) have access to sensitive DHS information, and that the Contractor will adhere to the following.</p>
<p>SUITABILITY DETERMINATION<br />DHS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating unescorted government facility and/or sensitive Government information access for Contractor employees, based upon the results of a background investigation. DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and make a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks. The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation. The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof. The granting of a favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such access by DHS, at any time during the term of the contract. No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed to EOD and/or access sensitive information or systems without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Office of Professional Responsibility, Personnel Security Unit (OPR-PSU). No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the OPR-PSU. Contract employees assigned to the contract not needing access to sensitive DHS information or recurring access to DHS ' facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS<br />Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, needing access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract. The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted. Background investigations will be processed through the Personnel Security Unit. Prospective Contractor employees with adequate security clearances issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) may not be required to submit complete security packages, as the clearance issued by DISCO may be accepted. Prospective Contractor employees without adequate security clearances issued by DISCO shall submit the following completed forms to the Personnel Security Unit through the COTR, no less than 5 days before the starting date of the contract or 5 days prior to the expected entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor:</p>

<p><br />Required forms will be provided by DHS at the time of award of the contract. Only complete packages will be accepted by the OPR-PSU. Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of the contract.</p>
<p>Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the US for three of the past five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation. In such cases, DHS retains the right to deem an applicant as ineligible due to insufficient background information.</p>
<p>The use of Non-U.S. citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this contract for any position that involves access to, development of, or maintenance to any DHS IT system.</p>
<p>CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY <br />If a prospective employee is found to be ineligible for access to Government facilities or information, the COTR will advise the Contractor that the employee shall not continue to work or to be assigned to work under the contract.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU may require drug screening for probable cause at any time and/ or when the contractor independently identifies, circumstances where probable cause exists.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU may require reinvestigations when derogatory information is received and/or every 5 years.<br /><br />DHS reserves the right and prerogative to deny and/ or restrict the facility and information access of any Contractor employee whose actions are in conflict with the standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635 and 5 CFR 3801, or whom DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information to which he or she would have access under this contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor will report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to the OPR-PSU through the COTR. Reports based on rumor or innuendo should not be made. The subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report. The report shall include the employees' name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU must be notified of all terminations/ resignations within five days of occurrence. The Contractor will return any expired DHS issued identification cards and building passes, or those of terminated employees to the COTR. If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report must be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued, the last known location and disposition of the pass or card. The COTR will return the identification cards and building passes to the responsible ID Unit.</p>
<p>SECURITY MANAGEMENT<br />The Contractor shall appoint a senior official to act as the Corporate Security Officer. The individual will interface with the OPR-PSU through the COTR on all security matters, to include physical, personnel, and protection of all Government information and data accessed by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The COTR and the OPR-PSU shall have the right to inspect the procedures, methods, and facilities utilized by the Contractor in complying with the security requirements under this contract. Should the COTR determine that the Contractor is not complying with the security requirements of this contract; the Contractor will be informed in writing by the Contracting Officer of the proper action to be taken in order to effect compliance with such requirements.</p>
<p>The following computer security requirements apply to both Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operations and to the former Immigration and Naturalization Service operations (FINS). These entities are hereafter referred to as the Department.</p>
<p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />When sensitive government information is processed on Department telecommunications and automated information systems, the Contractor agrees to provide for the administrative control of sensitive data being processed and to adhere to the procedures governing such data as outlined in DHS IT Security Program Publication DHS MD 4300.Pub. or its replacement. Contractor personnel must have favorably adjudicated background investigations commensurate with the defined sensitivity level.<br />Contractors who fail to comply with Department security policy are subject to having their access to Department IT systems and facilities terminated, whether or not the failure results in criminal prosecution. Any person who improperly discloses sensitive information is subject to criminal and civil penalties and sanctions under a variety of laws (e.g., Privacy Act).</p>
<p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING AND OVERSIGHT<br />All contractor employees using Department automated systems or processing Department sensitive data will be required to receive Security Awareness Training. This training will be provided by the appropriate component agency of DHS.</p>
<p>Contractors who are involved with management, use, or operation of any IT systems that handle sensitive information within or under the supervision of the Department, shall receive periodic training at least annually in security awareness and accepted security practices and systems rules of behavior. Department contractors, with significant security responsibilities, shall receive specialized training specific to their security responsibilities annually. The level of training shall be commensurate with the individual's duties and responsibilities and is intended to promote a consistent understanding of the principles and concepts of telecommunications and IT systems security.</p>
<p>All personnel who access Department information systems will be continually evaluated while performing these duties. Supervisors should be aware of any unusual or inappropriate behavior by personnel accessing systems. Any unauthorized access, sharing of passwords, or other questionable security procedures should be reported to the local Security Office or Information System Security Officer (ISSO).</p>

This Base Index shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract, including all options.<br />(2) The Adjusting Index shall be the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period. In the event the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report Current Price per Gallon for San Diego, Gasoline, unleaded regular discontinues, or alters substantially, its method of calculating the Index cited herein, the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate substitute for determining the price adjustment described herein.<br />(c) In preparation for exercise of an option period, the Contracting Officer shall apply the difference between the Base Index and the Adjusting Index to the option year prices by multiplying the increase/decrease times the number of gallons identified for each line item. Only the line items of the option year being exercised will be adjusted.<br />(d) An example of an adjustment calculation is provided below for informational purposes only.<br />For purposes of this example, assume that the contract price for the option period being exercised $2,000.00 per month, and includes costs for 200 gallons of gasoline. If the Base Index (the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation) is $2.90 per gallon and Adjustment Index (the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period) is $3.05 per gallon, the calculations for contract price adjustment would be as follows:</p>
<p>Adjusting Index $3.05 per gallon</p>
<p>Minus the Base Index<br />-$2.90 per gallon<br />Equals increase (or decrease) to the Base Index $ .15 increase<br /><br />Option Line Item gasoline quantity multiplied by increase (or decrease) 200 * .15 = $30.00</p>
<p>Option Line Item price adjusted by increase ( or decrease) $2,000.00 + $30.00 = $2,030.00</p>

Technical 2. Past Performance 3. Price<BR>A contract will be awarded to the offeror who offers the best value in accordance with the following evaluation factors for this requirement; Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  Technical combined with Past Performance is significantly more important that price.<BR>Technical will carry a weight of 40% Past Performance will carry a weight of 35% and Price will carry a weight of 25%.<BR><BR>The following adjectival ratings will be used for technical ratings:<BR>Adjectival rating<BR>Description of adjectival rating<BR>Very Good<BR>Proposal meets solicitation requirements, demonstrates a very good understanding of the requirements and has salient features that offer significant advantage to the Government.  Very good in all respects.  Advantages/strengths not offset by disadvantages/weaknesses.  Very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Government requirements.  <BR>Good<BR>Proposal meets most solicitation requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to the Government over basic RFP requirements.  Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant, unless significant advantages are proposed that outweigh significant disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications, given by contractor, were acceptable.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government requirements.   <BR>Satisfactory<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements, but offers disadvantages (weaknesses) outweighing other advantages (strengths).  Examples may include little or no experience cited; weak proposal; mimics RFP language rather than expressing offerors approach or understanding of the RFP.  Probability of success considered less than full confidence.<BR>Marginal<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements.  Examples:  Proposal does not address all required RFP criteria; little or no experience to the extent that Overall quality cannot be determined because of errors, omissions or deficiencies that may be capable of being corrected without a major rewrite or revision of proposal.  Probability of success is questionable without further explanation by offeror.  <BR>Unsatisfactory<BR>Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations.  Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies.<BR><BR>The following rating will be used for Past Performance Rating<BR>Risk rating<BR>Description of risk rating<BR>Very Low Risk<BR>Very high quality past performance.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was generally current and very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR>Low Risk<BR>Good quality past performance.  Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective actions to resolve where appropriate.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Average Risk<BR>Adequate quality of past performance.  Problems may have been identified and the contractor usually took adequate corrective action.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Although performance exceeds expectations and was rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were generally semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Above Average Risk<BR>Rather poor quality of past performance. Problems may have been identified and contractor occasionally took corrective action, but not always to the owners satisfaction.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>High Risk<BR>Unacceptable quality of past performance. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature.  Contractors corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective.  Performance was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral<BR>No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award(s) without discussions with offerors (except for needed clarifications as per FAR 15.306(a).  Therefore, your initial proposal should contain your best terms, as it pertains to cost/pricing.  Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss, or revise your original proposal.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p><br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 January 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 5 January 2010. Contact Ryan Suchy at 252-334-5472 or ryan.m.suchy@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation. Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5240, or at the following address: <br />USCG ALC<br />SRR Bldg 75<br />Attn: Ryan Suchy<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909</p>

How would you like the rails to be set up?... top rail, mid rail, and bottom rails.  To provide middle rails would be more expensive, but it would have much more support should workers end up storing items/objects against the fence. Have them submit the bid for top and bottom only, and include the middle rail as Option 1.3.  Geo-tech material vs. landscape fabric?  Please clarify.... geo-tech material is mentioned in solicitation, however, the diagram indicates to use landscape fabric.  The landscape fabric makes more sense... it is a weed barrier and very cost effective.  Geotech is a ground stabilizer used in retaining wall applications that extend over 4 ft. high, not a weed barrier, EXTREMELY expensive!

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure general design services for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communication and Public Liaison (OCPL). This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and and is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) under NLM-10-028/SRE. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541430 with a small business standard of $7.0 million.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) is actively involved in responding to the 1987 Congressional mandate "...to develop outreach programs aimed at the transfer of the latest scientific findings to all health professionals...in rural communities and other areas, and, to publicize the availability of its produce and services..." This legislation was prompted, in part, by concern that information on health and biomedical topics be readily and freely available for all populations, in easy-to-understand formats.<br /><br />In response, NLM wishes to engage the services of a Contractor in designing and producing promotional materials to reach health professionals, researchers, populations in rural communities, minorities and the general public. <br /><br />Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to secure the services of a Contractor with demonstrated ability to design, implement and produce printed materials, electronic media materials, Web sites and mount custom exhibits.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The task objectives are as follows: <br /><br />BRAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<br /><br />As a guideline, these steps are needed to develop successful brands and graphic communication materials. <br /><br />Phase 1: Planning<br />During this phase, Contractor meets with client as often as deemed appropriate by both parties, exploring NLM programs, services, audiences, messages, communications goals, etc. A design mission statement, better known as a "creative brief" is developed, outlining and identifying these important points and elements:<br /><br />a. Brand and communication objectives<br />b. Audience demographics<br />c. Current and future communication materials - establish features and formats<br />d. Aesthetic and style considerations<br />e. Competitive or similar brands - references those and conducts a review<br />f. Visual assets <br />g. Creative and other resources<br />h. Responsibilities of client and Contractor<br />i. Schedule<br />j. Establish overall budget and specific costs<br /><br />
<p>Phase 2: Conceptual Development<br />During this phase, several creative solutions are produced that achieve the objectives and establish the tone and aesthetics for the brand. The following materials are created for review by NLM:<br /><br />a. Visual concepts<br />b. Brand messaging/writing samples<br />c. Logo designs<br />d. Proposed Imagery<br />e. Brand artwork<br /><br />After review, revisions are made to finalize the tone, the aesthetic style of the brand and the brand photography and artwork.<br /><br />Phase 3: Design<br />The brand is implemented throughout the communication materials during this phase. As each pre-determined brand component is designed, sketches and comprehensives are produced for review and evaluation by NLM. As the designs are further developed, the result will be graphic standards and templates that establish controls for typography, color, imagery and artwork. Reviews and approvals may take several rounds of revisions to receive NLM's final approval. Production specifications are coordinated for art preparation. Production costs are provided as required.<br /><br />Phase 4: Production<br />Once the design for a brand component has been approved, the design template is finalized and production files that meet the vendor specifications are prepared. The Contractor will source and create all final artwork and maintain a very high level of quality. NLM will review each production file for accuracy and quality. With NLM's approval, those files are released for the item to be produced. As the approval process requires, vendor samples will be reviewed and coordinated.<br /><br />Phase 5: Documentation<br />The brand is documented in a brief manual for future reference during this phase. All design templates are organized for easy reference and future use. The depth and detail of brand documentation will be determined by the brand management procedures NLM can institute and manage. <br />Brand management is often the factor that makes a brand successful or not. Consistent implementation of a brand is its most important aspect. For the sake of the brand, NLM should plan for detailed documentation and an easy system of accessing and archiving templates and artwork.<br /><br />Task 1: Promotional Materials for NLM Outreach<br />To successfully design the items listed below, the Vendor would meet with NLM staff again, for planning. The brand would be implemented throughout the materials specified in this solicitation and across any other materials that NLM requests. As design progresses, brand standards and templates are established for consistent brand application.<br /><br />Once design for specific promotional materials has been approved, production files are prepared and art files coordinated with prospective vendors or government agencies.<br /><br />As required, the standards and templates would be documented and the files organized for easy access.<br /><br />With more detailed information, Vendor can address the specific project requirements. The Vendor should demonstrate the ability to produce printed materials, such as: <br /><br />a. brochures, including capabilities brochures<br />b. event kits <br />c. press kits <br />d. newsletters<br />e. stationery<br />f. direct mail <br />g. event invitations<br />h. packaging displays<br />i. special items in preparation for NLM's 175th anniversary (in 2011)<br />j. other specialty items, as determined by COTR<br /><br />Task 2: Web Site Design<br />Presence on the World Wide Web is critical to communications and outreach for the National Library of Medicine. Vendor will work with COTR and other NLM staff to create messages, text and images for sections of the NLM Web site, and for other online products, perhaps to include electronic newsletter, NLM Newsroom, and other online products. Vendor will also handle all technical requirements, including the content management system, content development cycles and interactive features of the sites. Wire frames and user flows would be provided. Vendor may also interface with NLM Web experts, as directed by COTR.<br /><br />Vendor will centrally manage each of the Library's projects, placing the Vendor at the center of all activities. The COTR will serve as the liaison between NLM and the creative team or any other third parties, when communication and contact are necessary. Access to the Contractor is, within reason, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via mobile phone and e-mail device.<br /><br />Vendor will manage multiple phases and tasks, controlling and monitoring workflow while maintaining a high level of service. The Vendor will use efficient technology and delivery services to coordinate information and materials to all project personnel, tracking items electronically and documenting them in spreadsheets, to identify critical relationships, deliverables and dates.<br /><br />At the outset of each project, the Contractor will meet with NLM to establish processes, scope of work, deliverables, responsibilities, critical paths and dependencies, schedules and budgets. As projects progress, the Contractor will issue progress reports indicating the status of work accomplished, work in progress, deliverables pending, schedules, budgets and interdependencies. During those briefings and as the project requires, the Contractor will inform NLM of any modifications to the project requirements and mediate any unforeseen issues. Foremost, the Contractor will act on behalf of NLM to ensure that the project is successful and is completed on time and on budget.<br /><br />To manage budgets, the Contractor will keep track of each line item's estimates for each task costs and in a master contract spreadsheet. This enables NLM to see how the budgets are portioned and realign funds as needed. Project estimates with further project cost detail are provided as tasks are required.<br /><br />For each task, estimates and a creative brief with a project plan is submitted to the client. Before works commences we obtain the approval of the COTR to the estimate and creative brief. As the project progresses, Contractor will seek notices to proceed from the COTR with each deliverable and milestone.<br /><br />Deliverables<br /><br />Contractor will design and produce a number of promotional materials, including, but not limited to: (1) designing and/or updating promotional materials, as listed above; and (2) designing and/or updating Web sites. The Government will have exclusive ownership of all deliverables produced under the resultant purchase order.<br /><br />&#9679; POSTER: Please provide an overall, typical cost for designing a 4-color 20 by 30 inches poster and separately identify, excluding costs associated with printing.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>This BAA is a contracting tool directly responsive to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Focused Long Term Challenge (FLTC) 5's Integrated Cyber Defense attribute.</p>
<p>Proactively defend cyberspace by anticipating and avoiding threats through understanding the cyber situation, predicting adversarial actions, assessing potential impacts, and by implementing deterrence and effects based defensive methodologies. Detect and defeat threats and protect information systems by engagement and influence through defensive mechanisms employing such methods as adversary denial and deception. Adaptively maintain, organize, and automatically regenerate and reconstitute resources to ensure continued mission operations.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate is soliciting whitepapers for FLTC focus areas and Computer Network, Defense &amp; Support. The following section provides a description of six FLTC focus areas within FLTC 5's Integrated Cyber Defense attribute and a general description of the Computer Network Defense (CND) &amp; Support Technology base.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC for each FLTC focus area is provided for QUESTIONS ONLY. See Section IV Paragraph 6 for submission details.</p>
<p><br />Strategic Cyber Defense</p>
<p>Background: Many describe cyberspace as a domain that favors the attacker. This reality is largely due to the reactive mindset that currently dominates our approach to cyber defense. Defensive operations are constantly playing "catch up" to an ever-increasing onslaught of attacks that seem to always stay one step ahead. In order to tip the balance in favor of the defender, we must develop a strategic approach to cyber defense that transcends the day to day reactive operations and provides the means to conduct defense in a proactive, goal-oriented fashion using systems that are robust and can be trusted to support the mission.</p>
<p>Objective: Avoid threats entirely by obviating the effects of adversary actions, deterring attacks, and anticipating threats and proactively reshaping our defensive posture. Avoidance eliminates the need to fight or respond, and may be achieved by three avenues, each of which is described below.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Strategic Cyber Defense" focus area will be concerned with the following research challenges, but other approaches that achieve the stated objective will be considered:</p>
<p>FY11 SPECIFIC TOPIC AREA: AVOID THE CYBER THREAT</p>
<p>Background: Many describe cyberspace as a domain that favors the attacker. This is largely due to the asymmetric advantage that an attacker currently holds in the preparation of attacks, as well as being able to choose the time and location of attacks. These factors are further compounded by the relative anonymity and static nature of current cyber infrastructures, resulting in comparatively low risk to the attacker. As a result, defensive operations are constantly playing "catch up".</p>
<p>Objective: Avoid threats by deterring attackers, obviating the effects of adversary actions by making our systems essentially "non-interoperable" with attacks, and eliminating the attackers' advantages of time and preparation by forcing them into a continuous discovery process. To eliminate the attacker's advantage, we must develop strategies and associated technologies to deter adversaries before they strike, modify the cyber domain to our advantage, and introduce agility into our systems and networks to evade attacks and disrupt the adversary's cyber planning processes.</p>
<p>For FY11, we are specifically seeking white papers only in the area of "Assured and Dynamic Configuration" as described below.</p>
<p>Assured and Dynamic Configuration:</p>
<p>We desire a dynamic and proactive capability for automatically generating, effecting, and validating a functional and secure system/network configuration based on policy, architectural specifications, and operational requirements to proactively and continually invalidate the adversaries' efforts to map and understand our networks. A key element of this technology challenge is effectively generating and implementing secure and operationally-responsive configurations without introducing new vulnerabilities, and doing so in a manner that is transparent to authorized users of the systems and networks. We are looking for approaches that primarily integrate existing technologies into a comprehensive capability for assuring configuration under dynamic and proactive reconfiguration, and verify that configurations have been correctly executed. Consider trade-offs between proactive threat mitigation and resource consumption.</p>

<p><br />Global Cyber Situational Understanding</p>
<p>Background: Situation Awareness (SA) as defined by Dr. Mica Endsley is a "state of knowledge" and is inherently oriented towards the human mind (Endsley, M.R. "Theoretical Underpinnings of Situational Awareness: A Critical Review). What this research area addresses is research and development of the processes which "achieve, acquire, or maintain SA". The SA Reference Model created by AFRL captures these processes diagrammatically. These processes include various components of SA such as; perception (data, object, and situation assessment), comprehension (situation, threat, and impact assessment of the now), and projection (threat and impact assessment of plausible futures). All aspects of SA are considered for a myriad of cyber operators ranging from network security analysts, to cyber attack, to commanders.</p>
<p>To enable the understanding of an adversary in the cyberspace domain, decision makers need an awareness of adversarial capabilities, opportunities, past behavior and intent. This &lsquo;Knowledge of Them' is a key component of the larger concept of Situation Awareness. Analysis of existing data sources can assist with developing this understanding but require technologies to perform the analysis.</p>
<p>Objective: The goal of this research for FY11 is to leverage existing data through analysis that develops an understanding of cyberspace adversarial capability, opportunity, past behavior and intent with the objective of providing this automated analysis to broader Situation Awareness tools.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Global Cyber Situational Understanding" focus area will be concerned with the following research challenges, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>&bull; Enabling Human perception of N-dimensional cyberspace<br />&bull; Validating the authenticity or value of cyber event data (e.g. ensure it is not spoofed or misleading)<br />&bull; Developing meaningful cyber defense metrics<br />&bull; Developing appropriate cyber event &lsquo;observables'<br />&bull; Developing analysis technologies that can identify the cyber threat in terms of adversarial capability, opportunity, past behavior and intent</p>
<p>This research area adds the following specific research challenges;" Identify and leverage existing data sources that contribute to the understanding and analysis of the cyber adversary, identify any shortcomings within the data sources. This area could also be viewed as a &lsquo;deep dive' into the data available to develop awareness of an adversary.</p>
<p>For the current cycle supporting the FY 11 investment strategy process, we are specifically seeking white papers in the area of "Cyber Adversary Situation Awareness".</p>

<p>Incorruptible Data Codes / Executables</p>
<p>Background: The Department of Defense (DoD) requires trustworthy data and software executables for successful performance of assigned missions. However, despite existing security measures designed to prevent malicious manipulation of data and executable (both static and dynamic), a determined party can easily manipulate both data and software executables on commercial off the shelf (COTS) information systems. Recently the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has invested in the Software Protection Initiative (SPI) to pursue research and development in an array of technologies for prevention of piracy, malicious tampering, and reverse engineering of DoD application software. The technologies developed and the research outcomes of SPI form the foundation for continued advancement of capabilities the DoD requires to assure trust in the data and executables.</p>
<p>Objective: Deliver self-contained verifiably incorruptible/trustworthy data and executables while at rest, under execution, or in transit upon and within any environment/system relevant to the warfighter. This includes both our own systems and systems that we do not own or directly control.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Incorruptible Data Codes / Executables" focus area is interested in the research challenges identified below. However, different approaches and concepts deemed to have significant potential to achieve the stated objectives will be considered.</p>
<p>&bull; Data (easily manipulated, many types, can be highly complex, comes from trusted and untrusted sources, utilized in a multitude of diverse environments) <br />&bull; Measuring and verifying incorruptibility/trust <br />&bull; Software-only data and executable protections <br />&bull; Data and executable self-protection<br />&bull; Hardware assisted data and executable protections</p>
<p>&bull; Development and technical evaluation and refinement of watermarking algorithms and, in particular, protocols for the purpose of information provenance, pedigree, and assurance<br />o Addressing all forms of data and multimedia formats; to include: images, audio, video, formatted and raw data types<br />o Protocols with provable security which incorporate other accepted security mechanisms (timestamping, hashing, key exchange, etc.)<br />o Disadvantaged, rich and heterogeneous environments/platforms. Focus on DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) applications and scenarios<br />o Particular emphasis on:<br />&#61607; Interaction of watermarked data with watermarked/secured code which has Anti-Tamper and Protection guarantees<br />&#61607; Watermarking algorithms and protocols which provide multiple aspects (provenance, pedigree, assurance) while working in conjunction with data for specific application (sensing, etc)</p>
<p>Funding for this technology area is not available in FY11 thus no white paper inputs will need submission for this FY</p>

<p><br />Cybercraft ((Now referred to as Defense, Introspection, and Control of the Enterprise (DICE))</p>
<p>Background: The Cybercraft focus area seeks to provide combatant commanders with a root of trust for defending the computer network upon which US dominance in Air, Space, and Cyberspace relies. The Cybercraft system provides a trusted platform for automated command, control, communications (C3), and delivery of defensive cyber capabilities.</p>
<p>Objective: The Cybercraft focus area aims to address critical Air Force cyber defense issues including the disparity between time-to-attack and time-to-defend, trust of current cyber defenses, and situational awareness in cyberspace. Core Cybercraft components include the following: Platform - Hardware "root of trust" which enables trusted execution of payloads and ensures a user with root access to the underlying system cannot compromise the Cybercraft system. Payloads - Platform-specific executables that provide specific capabilities. Categories of payloads include sensors (sense the environment), effectors (change the environment) and decision engines (interpret policy and issue commands). Policies - Encode the commander's intent or rules of engagement in a machine-readable format. Cybercraft Store - Provides non-volatile storage of commands, payloads, policies, and environment data. Operator Interface - Allows Cybercraft operators to upload new policies, new payload executables, and issue commands to one or more Cybercraft platforms. Visualization - Provides multi-level, geospatial, logical, and dynamic situational awareness and mission mapping for commanders and Cybercraft operators.</p>
<p>FY11 FOCUS AREA: DEFENSE, INTROSPECTION, AND CONTROL OF THE ENTERPRISE (DICE)</p>
<p>Background: The current focus of computer security is at the operating system (e.g. role-based users), applications (e.g. anti-virus programs), and the network (e.g. firewalls). The focus of the DICE program is below the operating system at the hardware and virtualized hardware layers. Innovative technology developments are sought to defend computers and computer networks, and assure dynamic mission objectives. The vision of this program is "A trusted execution environment within each device (e.g. computer, network router) that is a platform for conducting cyber defensive operations that uses "out of band" communication, and remains trusted should the host be compromised." The two areas of high interest are 1) Virtualization and 2) Root of Trust.</p>
<p>Virtualization: The combination of complex applications running on complex operating systems presents a very large footprint to attack. Additionally, DoD has very little control over modern shrink-wrapped software applications and operating systems. Current cost concerns prohibit DoD from developing, building, and maintaining their own applications, operating systems, and hardware. Virtualization technologies offer ways to defeat cyber attacks prior to engagement. Key concepts include but are not limited to: A secure environment that encapsulates and protects the operating systems, device drivers, and applications; secure, segregated, inaccessible areas for critical code; and secure communications for critical code processes.</p>
<p>Root of Trust: The integrity of computers and computer networks is dependent on the integrity of the host hardware and host root account. This area of research investigates modeled hardware root of trust that imparts immunity from an adversary with root access to the underlying host. Innovative ways to achieve a secure root of trust on a host are sought. Also sought are ways to achieve a network root of trust.</p>

<p><br />Assured Load Balancing Enterprise</p>
<p>Background: The DoD has a critical need for information systems that adapt and/or gracefully degrade when unexpected events occur. These systems are subjected to constant change such as overload, component failure, cyber attacks, evolving operational requirements, and/or a dynamic operational environment. Most mission critical systems do not have adaptation mechanisms to support Quality of Service (QoS) (functionality) and/or Quality of Information Assurance (QoIA) (security) in the presence of unpredictable anomalies. A system should adapt to these changes by reconfiguring its resources to provide a different, though acceptable, level of service and/or security to its users. Without adaptation many important activities receive fewer resources than needed while less important activities waste resources by receiving more resources than necessary. Most existing systems either do not adapt or have ad hoc hardwired mechanisms to accommodate only a small, predefined, set of changes. There are no standard methodologies or common tools to assist application developers in managing this sort of adaptation.</p>
<p>QoS to most people only deals with network/communication performance (for example diffserv, intserv, Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPV6). The QoS that is being described in this FLTC focus area is a holistic approach which incorporates the user, application, middleware and communications substrate. QoS is a service-based system that must manage/control: processing, data management, and communication resources on an end-to-end basis to support the mission critical user/application. The Air Force has invested in this holistic approach to QoS, but much more work needs to be done.</p>
<p>QoIA is a holistic approach to security. We need to be able to quantitatively measure, characterize and control various dimensions of security (availability, integrity and confidentiality) based on user/application requirements. Many security mechanisms exist in research, COTS and government off the shelf (GOTS) that cover the various dimensions of security. What is lacking and what is the main focus of this work is quantitative measurement and fine-grained control to better characterize and utilize the security mechanisms based on mission requirement and/or user needs.</p>
<p>Objective: Preserve mission critical functions, while controlling &amp; conveying trustworthiness. The "Assured Load Balancing Enterprise" focus area will develop the tools and technology to realize computer-based systems (i.e., systems composed of hardware, software, and human entities) that tolerate, adapt and/or gracefully degrade based on user (mission-critical) requirements. Information systems must adapt and/or gracefully degrade to provide a guaranteed level of Quality of Service (QoS - functionality (processing, data management and communication)) and Quality of Information Assurance (QoIA - security (measuring and controlling information assurance in Cyber Space)) to the information system enterprise during system overload, component failure, and cyber attacks. This focus area will look at what it means to gracefully degrade QoS and QoIA and what the tradeoff space is between the two. This focus area will also develop QoS and QoIA aware mechanisms and survivability/assurance architectures to guarantee end-to-end QoS and QoIA by adapting and/or gracefully degrading to support mission-critical information enterprise requirements. The realization and enforcement of end-to-end QoS and QoIA implies a degree of control that is fine-grained and extensive. Therefore, an accompanying challenge to creating mechanisms for realizing and enforcing end-to-end QoS and QoIA is to protect those very same mechanisms.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Assured Load Balancing Enterprise" focus area will be concerned with the following research challenges, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>&bull; Cyber Defense Metrics<br />o Formalizing QoS &amp; QoIA so they can be quantifiably described, specified, measured and managed based on mission requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Graceful Degradation - Trade Space of QoS &amp; QoIA<br />o Understanding the trade space of QoS and QoIA on an end-to-end basis <br />o Identifying the mechanisms and conditions that influence QoIA and how they complement or interfere with QoS<br />o Developing algorithms that perform application-based trade space balancing between QoS (functionality) and QoIA (security)<br />o Creating a taxonomy of QoS and QoIA services<br />o Policy development and de-confliction</p>
<p>&bull; Assured End to End QoS &amp; QoIA - (Survivability Architecture)<br />o Composing a survivability architecture that incorporates service delivery and information assurance requirements<br />o Measuring a system's QoS and QoIA capacity at both design time and runtime<br />o Control plane mechanisms to monitor and adapt system performance to guarantee end-to-end QoS and QoIA<br />o Policy enforcement<br />o Adapting and/or gracefully degrading (per application-based, user-provided policy/requirements) QoS and QoIA individually and with respect to each other during malicious and non-malicious faults<br />o Developing a QoS/QoIA dashboard for control of and visibility into system performance</p>
<p>&bull; Understanding how the layers of cyber defense, COTS, and legacy code impact QoS and QoIA</p>
<p>Funding for this technology area is not available in FY11 thus no white paper inputs will need submission for this FY.</p>

<p>Self-Regenerating Incorruptible Enterprise</p>
<p>Background: Existing approaches to information system security and survivability consist of preventing, detecting and containing unintentional errors and/or cyber attacks. These systems use static means to survive, but are unable to adapt, learn, tolerate and/or reconstitute dynamically in response to unforeseen errors and/or unknown cyber attacks. These systems simply fail miserably when subjected to previously unknown events. Recent research has demonstrated the ability to tolerate errors and/or attacks and gracefully degrade with respect to user (mission critical) requirements. The problem with this approach is that regardless of how well systems are protected or how well they tolerate errors and/or attacks; they will eventually fail over time unless they have the ability to self-regenerate. On the positive side, systems that tolerate by gracefully degrading service buy time to learn the root cause of errors and attacks, thereby providing valuable knowledge to the self-regeneration process. What are needed are information systems that are able to adapt, learn, tolerate and/or reconstitute dynamically in response to unforeseen errors and/or unknown cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Objective: The objective of this "Self Regenerative, Incorruptible Enterprise" focus area is to fight through cyber attacks by enabling information systems to learn, regenerate themselves in response to unforeseen errors and/or attacks, and automatically improve their ability to deliver critical services. If successful, self-regenerative systems will reconstitute the information systems back to its initial operating capability while decreasing their vulnerability to an ever-increasing number of attacks.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Self Regenerative, Incorruptible Enterprise" product will create persistent information systems and data. Persistent information systems and data are hard to disable or remove (like malware). This focus area will look at malware for techniques that can be utilized to make software more robust. Another focus area will be to use biologically inspired diversity to dynamically create and compose immune components. Information systems must automatically recognize and learn about novel cyber and service attacks to dynamically create immunized versions of information system components and data. Information systems and data must have redundancy and the ability to regenerate required functionality with increased error/attack immunity, whereby corrupted components can be regenerated without negatively affecting the whole system. This focus area will be concerned with the following research challenges, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>&bull; Persistent applications and data<br />&bull; Reconstitution of data and state<br />&bull; Dynamically recognize, characterize and understand novel cyber attacks and service anomalies (understand root cause)<br />&bull; New approaches to software development (model based, specification based, component based, flow based, etc)<br />&bull; Dynamic synthetic diversity (machine generated correct, immune, and composable functionally equivalent software components)<br />&bull; Synchronizing repair activities without interrupting ongoing mission priorities<br />&bull; Self optimization with respect to achieving incorruptibility (restore initial operating capacity while reducing vulnerabilities to errors and attacks)</p>
<p>Funding for FY11 is planned in three focused technology areas, drawing down from the technology approaches described above, specifically: (1) Runtime Machine Generated Reconstitution, (2) Reconstitution of Data and State, and (3) Understanding Synthetic Diversity. The main focus of this topic area is to draw specific research for runtime machine synthesis of code to dynamically recover with immunity from cyber attacks. We seek innovative approaches that permit reasoning about and recovering from cyber attacks using high level abstractions instead of being confined to low level code analysis, as is the paradigm today. Use of high level abstractions that include, but are not limited to 4th generation high-level languages (e.g., model based, specification based, component based, flow based, and formal methods/models) will enable run-time machine synthesis of code that eradicates vulnerabilities and recovers with immunity from cyber attacks. This on-the-fly machine code regeneration makes system hardening and recovery automatic and complete. Previously damaged systems must have the ability to rapidly recover with immunity using synthetic diversity or other techniques, while maintaining data and state for continued mission progression. These systems must automatically fix/restore compromised or corrupted data and state to ensure services are available for mission critical operation.</p>
<p>(1) Machine Generated Reconstitution - The goal of this technology area is to automatically machine generate diverse code from high level languages, models or specs to recover with immunity from cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Key Technology Challenges:<br />&bull; Run-time machine synthesis of code that recovers with immunity <br />&bull; Dynamically recognizing, characterizing and understanding novel cyber attacks and service anomalies<br />&bull; New approaches to software development (e.g., model based, specification based, component based, flow based, formal methods/models)<br />&bull; Synchronizing repair activities without interrupting ongoing mission priorities<br />&bull; Restoring initial operating capacity while reducing vulnerabilities to errors and attacks<br />&bull; Real-time certification and accreditation<br />(2) Reconstitution of Data and State - The goal of this technology area is continued mission progression by maintaining/recovering data or state in real time.</p>
<p>Key Technology Challenges:<br />&bull; Automatically repair corrupted data &amp; state and remove any residue from the cyber attack<br />&bull; Translate data and state so it can be used by the new functionally equivalent machine generated code</p>
<p>(3) Understanding Synthetic Diversity - The goal of this technology area is to better understand the use of synthetic diversity to break cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Key Technology Challenges:<br />&bull; Ensure complete attack space coverage by expanding/developing new synthetic diversity techniques<br />&bull; Understanding synthetic diversity techniques' effectiveness against various classes of cyber attack</p>

Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>AFRL/RIGA will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY. Prior to award, the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>TPOC Name: Jason Siegfried<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3326<br />Email: Jason.Siegfried@rl.af.mil</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.    The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - This requirement will be funded in whole or in part by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009.&nbsp; The purpose of this solicitation notice is to advertise that the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is contracting for the interiors of the Building 1 Extension Project. The B1E will be one of the most technologically advanced buildings in the world. The laboratory combines the features of close temperature control, vibration isolation, air cleanliness, and demanding power quality into a facility of crucial national importance. The B1E consists of an L4 High Performance Lab, L5 Instrument Lab and L6 Precision. Temperature control will be achieved down to +/- 0.1 degree C in some areas, humidity control to +/- 5%, air filtration to M3.5 (class 100), and vibration control to &lt; 3 micrometers/second. At the B1E, electrical substations will be installed to transform site high voltage of 13.2 kV down to 480/277 V. State-of-the-art clean power quality will be required to meet stringent lab requirements and eliminate variables from scientific research. The new facility will provide for the current needs of quantum science research in computing and communications, nanotechnology, improved atomic clock research, high speed electronic measurements, and microfabrication of research devices.</p>
<p>The proposed B1E gross building area is approximately 137,000 square feet. Environmental and space requirements for the building are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's most technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1E cannot be economically met with renovated laboratory space; therefore, the B1E is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market.</p>
<p>The award is anticipated for March of 2010.&nbsp; The estimated price range of this project is $50,000,000.00 to $65,000,000.00.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE&nbsp;SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS, ALL INTERESTED PARTIES MUST EMAIL OR MAIL A REQUEST TO JASON GERLOFF (JGERLOFF@NIST.GOV) REFERENCING THE SOLICITATION NUMBER (SB1341-10-RP-0003) <br /><br />As a reminder, all contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 800-333-0505 or on line at <a href="https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html">https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html</a>.</p>

RECOVERY - This requirement will be funded in whole or in part by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009.
<p>Any firm interested in the solicitation is to contact Jason Gerloff via email (jgerloff@nist.gov) and copy Courtney Shaw (<a href="mailto:shawc@boulder.nist.gov">shawc@boulder.nist.gov</a>) for the Drawings and Specifications.</p>
<p>Proposal due date is January 27, 2008, at 12:00 p.m. Boulder, CO time. Any proposal late is subject to FAR 52.214-7 Late submissions, Modifications, and withdrawals of Bids (NOV 1999).</p>

<DESC><p>CROOKSTON RIVERBANK RESTORATION: The project is located along the Red Lake River near the city of Crookston, MN. The work consists of clearing the existing (rip rap) rock in the channel to the originally designed elevation and constructing a 6 foot high berm in the designed location. The berm will consist of sheet piling 20 feet in length that will extend to the channel sides. The sheet piling will be driven 14 feet underground. In addition to the sheet piling, clay material will be added to the upstream and downstream sides with a 6:1 slope extending to the channel elevation. The material will then be covered with R470 riprap. Any disturbed area will be smoothed out and a seed mixture will be applied for vegetative growth. The estimated magnitude of this requirement in terms of physical characteristics and estimated price is between $250,000 and 500,000. The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the small business size standard (Heavy Engineering and Construction) is $33,500,000</p>

<DESC>Request for Comment - Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology (T4) ProgramNOTE: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED BELOW.NOTE:  THE DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF COMMENTS HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO JANUARY 11, 2010.This is a request for comment only.  Do not submit a proposal or quote.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) is soliciting for comments related to the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the T4 Program.  The PWS is for the upcoming T4 Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multi-award task order contract for Information Technology (IT) Services.  After reviewing the DRAFT PWS attachment within this announcement, interested and capable contractors are invited to provide responses to the following questions.  Responses should follow this format and be submitted electronically as one complete document.  Solicitation Number VA118-10-RP-0052 has been assigned for tracking purposes only.  The Classification Code and NAICS code are preliminary.Company:Address:Point of Contact:Phone Number:Fax Numbers:Email Address:1.	Has the PWS sufficiently described the technical functional areas that encompass IT Services?                       ______ YES             _______ NO2.	 If no, please provide your technical functional area comments/recommendations.3.	Please provide any remaining positive or negative feedback regarding the PWS such as recommended changes, noted exceptions, ambiguities, etc.All information should be provided to Kevin Wymbs at kevin.wymbs@va.gov and Carol Newcomb at carol.newcomb@va.gov  no later than close of business, January 11, 2010.T4 Questions and Answers # 11.	We have heard the final RFP will be released in Feb 2010 (4 weeks following the receipt of industry questions regarding the draft PWS).  The Draft PWS does not provide adequate information to evaluate and prepare for proposal activities.  Evaluation criteria and instructions in draft form will enable us to properly plan for resources needed to support the proposal responses as well as the bid decision. Response:  The RFP release date has not been determined.  Evaluation criteria as well as other information will be provided at a later date along with a schedule.  You should be checking FedBizOps for the latest information. Here are some of the questions we need to answer to help our senior management make a bid decision:  a.	Will award be based on all functional areas (like Alliant) or a subset of the functional areas (like Eagle)?  Response:  The acquisition strategy has not been determined.b.	Is it the VA's desire that this be a small business set-aside contract, that large businesses sub to small businesses. Was the Sources Sought released to gauge small business interest and level of participation? Response:  The acquisition strategy has not been determined.  We are currently in the process of conducting market research which will assist us in determining the acquisition strategy.c.	To limit the number of awards, does the VA want industry to cluster together to form large teams (eg:: Northrop Grumman as prime with Lockheed Martin and GD and lots of small businesses as subs)?  Response:  The number of awards has not yet been determined.  2.	We have heard that responses to sample tasks will be required 15 days before proposal responses.  The purpose of this exercise to assess how well offerors respond to quick-turn TOs.  However, at proposal preparation time, offerors will not have their T4 TO response organizations established, therefore that exercise will not adequately measure our ability to quickly respond (once our T4 Task Order Response organization is established)..  a.	Will sample TOs be required as part of the proposal response? Response: While the acquisition strategy has not been determined, it is not uncommon for agencies to use this approach in the source selection evaluation.b.	How will sample TOs be factored into the evaluation criteria?Response: The acquisition strategy and use of sample tasks not yet been determined.c.	Will sample TO responses be due before proposal responses to the RFP?Response: The acquisition strategy and use of sample tasks not yet been   determined.

     Requisition Number:     N00259-10-RCE-0084

2.  Nature or Description of the Action being Approved:

Justification is for the award of a five year FFP IDIQ to secure nuclear PET radiopharmaceuticals for the Nuclear Medicine Clinic.  This acquisition is in support of Naval Medical Centers Mission of providing continuous improvement to the quality healthcare, providing casualty care to the wounded veterans and providing preventive care for service members ready to deploy.   This service is needed in order to diagnose, stage and treatment evaluations for fractures, infections, brain, heart studies and metastatic cancer. These products will be needed on a daily, weekly and/or monthly schedule.  

3.  Description of Supplies/Services:

To deliver radio-labeled pharmaceuticals to the nuclear medicine clinic to be utilized in performing diagnostic, evaluation and post-treatment scans and for staging and treatment of cancers and other medical diseases.  These radiopharmaceuticals are needed to treat patients on a daily basis.  All products will meet with the NRC standards.  
Vendor must be in a local area (50 mile radius) due to the half life of radiopharmaceuticals.  Company needs to be able to deliver product within ONE hour of notice.  Services will provide necessary personnel to make and delivery these products directly to the nuclear medicine clinic by the shortest transfer path.  Theses products will need to be received by one of the nuclear medicine staff members.  Products are not to be left in the hallway, at the door or unaccompanied at any given time.  There will be weekly schedules with the possibility of add on emergency patients.  The clinic will have the option of phoning in the orders to be received. All products will be paid for through the WAWF system.  Vendor will have a daily tracking system of orders to be available upon request for comparison to hospital orders. Vendor will need to provide an updated copy of their Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) License to the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO).


4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open Competition.  
The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source as implemented by paragraph 6.302-1(c) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  

		

5.  Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.

PETNET is within close proximity of the hospital and can supply all the radioactive pharmaceuticals and tracers to the hospital within a short period of time.  The vendor has all radiopharmaceuticals needed for patient specific criteria.  With shortages of nuclear medicine isotopes, PETNET offers some alternative radiopharmaceuticals, this command can utilize that will save the command an average of $3,500.00 per patient, preventing disengagement due to time constraints on other modalities.  They have a certified radiopharmacist.  They meet all the NRC standards for making and providing theses products to us. 
Amongst the PET agents to be utilized, FDG is the most common agent and is used for patients with cancer, being involved in cancer detection, staging, therapy and follow up studies after initiation of therapy.  Other isotopes other than FDG can be utilized to look for dementia and Alzheimers disease, infection of unknown origin and heart viability.  Sodium Fluoride is a PET agent which is utilized to evaluate for fractures, metastatic bone disease and bone viability for amputees.  Rubidium is a cardiac perfusion agent which is used to triage patients in the emergency room as well as identify those patients who may be at risk for a myocardial event during a planned surgical procedure. For the above listed reasons, PetNet is the only source that would be meet this requirement.

6.  Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers as Many Sources as Practicable.

This is the only place in the local vicinity that has the capability to provide each radio isotope that is on the list to take care of our patients. A notice of intent to sole source will be posted to FBO in an attempt to locate more potential contractors. Market Research was conducted by contacting local hospitals and through internet searches and use of past procurements to come to the conclusion that there is only one responsible source.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price.

The anticipated cost to the government of the supplies/services covered by this J & A is considered fair and reasonable based on the commercially available prices in the area.

8.  Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.
In accordance with FAR 5.201, an announcement will be posted to FBO.gov.
