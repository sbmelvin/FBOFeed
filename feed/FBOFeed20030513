<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is issuing Broad Agency Announcement No. BAA-2003-1 for “Research Projects and Technology Advancements Under the Next Generation High-Speed Rail Program.”   This program is a key element in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s overall effort to promote high-speed rail in the United States, particularly in selected congested inter-urban corridors.  The program supports the advancement of high-speed rail, particularly on existing infrastructure, by improving, adapting, and demonstrating potentially more cost-effective technologies, which have wide application in U.S. corridors.  The FRA intends to support projects that will bring about advancements in high-speed rail technology, promote continued development and implementation of high-speed rail, and advance the state-of-the-art of U.S. high-speed rail technology.   Technologies most likely to help facilitate the deployment of high-speed rail service are those which will (1) enhance the revenue-generating capability of high speed operations by attracting greater ridership by reducing trip-times, upgrading customer service quality, increasing reliability, or improving on time performance; (2) bring about capital cost reductions and economy in producing equipment and facilities; (3) reducing operating costs of high-speed rail service by providing more efficient operations; (4) improving the reliability of equipment and infrastructure components by reducing failures and/or reducing false failure detections; and/or (5) enhance the social benefits and/or environmental aspects of high-speed rail.  This is an unrestricted solicitation for which private industries, state and local governments, and universities may submit proposals in response to the BAA solicitation.

Based on our market research, the microwave technology is innovative, unique, and has a high potential to meet our requirements.  AAC is uniquely qualified as a sole source of supply since it has successfully built a protot ype and demonstrated the microwave technique.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to award a sole source, performance based contract to the Port of Corpus Christi Authority (PCCA), Corpus Christi, Texas.  This contract will be fixed price.  The Coast Guard requires enhanced maritime domain awareness and knowledge of the positions, identity, and intentions of vessels operating within the jurisdictional waters of the Port of Corpus Christi Authority.  Therefore, the Government intends to procure communications services directly from the Vessel Traffic Information Service (VTIS) operated by the PCCA.  The VTIS is staffed, operated, and maintained by the PCCA Harbormaster.  This is a restricted solicitation.  By law under the State of Texas, the PCCA is solely responsible for all services performed in the Port under its authority and domain. The period of performance for this acquisition is one year.  All services are to be performed at the Port of Corpus Christi in Corpus Christi, Texas.   This contract is for the receipt of port safety and security information originating from the VTIS operated by the PCCA.   Approximately 90 percent of the total tonnage moved through the Port each year is comprised of oil and petrochemicals, which makes tank vessels and tank barges the predominant traffic.  This contract will allow the PCCA to upgrade their VTIS system as necessary in order to provide the information required by the Coast Guard.   Information and services that the Coast Guard will receive under this acquisition include the capability to track AIS equipped vessels; means to monitor maritime activity in the ship channels and the approaches from off-shore, capability to communicate with vessels via VHF-FM, and capability to electronically track vessels operating within the limits of surveillance.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  All interested parties have up to15 days from the publication of this notice of intent to request a copy of the Request For Proposal (RFP). All correspondence should be addressed to: Commandant (G-ACS-5/AGS/Room 5222), U. S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW, Washington, DC 20593-0001—NOTE 22 applies.   Signed: Augustine Green-Smith, Contracting Officer.

<DESC>COMMERCIAL ITEM REQUEST FOR QUOTATION/PROPOSAL FOR RECONSTRUCTION OF COURTROOM AND LOBBY CHANDELIERS AT THE FEDERAL BUILDING AND U.S. COURTHOUSE, 131 E. 4TH ST., DAVENPORT, IA  52801.  THIS ACQUISITION IS SET-ASIDE 100% FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  This contract is for reconstruction, transportation, and installation of fifteen (15) large-scale, ornate, customer chandeliers.  Structural supports and wiring to the junction box will be by others and the chandelier contractor will be required to visit the project site prior to installation for coordination purposes.  The Bailey Reynolds Chandelier Company in Kansas City, Missouri, which no longer exists, fabricated the original chandeliers in the early 1930’s and the location or condition of the original chandeliers is unknown.  Reconstruction shall be done according to drawings and specifications provided.  Copies of the original shop drawings will be provided to the successful contractor upon request.  There are two (2) different types of chandeliers.  Seven (7) chandeliers will be seven (7) feet in length, and will include carved plate glass panels, with metal parts of brass and case bronze.  Eight (8) chandeliers will be over eight feet in length, and will include brass and cast bronze metal parts, with some glass elements.  Patterns for large castings shall be in sand.  Full-scale models of castings of all major components and decorative elements shall be required.  The project site will be under major renovation in 2003 and 2004.  Completed chandeliers shall be installed on site between the dates of September 1, 2004, and October 31, 2004.  The actual installation date(s) shall be coordinated with the Government and the renovation construction contractor.  Estimated cost range:  $500,000 to $750,000.  This is a competitive negotiated commercial item acquisition.  Proposal will be evaluated based on technical submission and price.  The Government intends to use the “greatest value concept” in selecting the successful contractor.  The “greatest value concept” is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the quotation/solicitation with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of technical and price.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract/purchase order without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for the contract/purchase order award, and my discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Factors to be considered, in order of importance, are:  Performance, Management/Product Plan, Background/Capacity, Experience, and Price.  All requests for bid documents should be in written form and faxed or emailed to:  Georgann Butler, (816-823-5931 or 816-926-3571) or georgann.butler@gsa.gov.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Denise Ryerkerk, by fax (816-823-2269) or email:  denise.Ryerkerk@gsa.gov
Bid documents and drawings will be uploaded with this FEDBIZOPPS for your use or you may request a copy of each.  These requests should be in writing to Georgann Butler with your DUNS number listed and/or a copy of your business license.  Proposals are to be received in this office by 4:30 pm CST on May 30, 2003.

<DESC>Title:  Performance Based Logistics Contract for Supplemental O-Level and full OEM Logistics Program Providing Supply, Engineering and Maintenance Support for Navy T56-A-427 Turboprop Engines and Quick Engine Change Kits for E-2C Applications. Description: The NAVICP intends to negotiate a sole source performance based logistics contract with Rolls-Royce Corporation, Defense North America, Indianapolis, IN 46421, for supplemental organizational level and full OEM support of the T56-A-427 turboprop engine and the quick engine change kit designed for E-2C applications.  This contract requires performance of a comprehensive logistics program, providing engineering, supply and maintenance support for approximately 200 engines for up to five years to achieve agreed upon reliability and availability metrics.  Reimbursement will be based primarily on a fixed rate for each hour of en gine life consumed.  Navy site support at Point Mugu, CA and Norfolk, VA will be required in addition to commercial depot repairs and potentially test and manufacturing support at Patuxent River, MD and St. Augustine, FL.  Rolls Royce is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the T56-A-427 engine and is, therefore, the only source that possesses the requisite technical knowledge and technical data to perform the work requirements within the time required to meet Navy requirements.  The U.S. Government does not own full data rights for the T56-A-427 engine.  See Notes 22, 26.

<DESC>This is a revision to Procurement Notice previously advertised under  N62472-02-C-0018.  This procurement is being issued as UNRESTRICTED. The Department of Navy intends to issue an RFP on or about 12 June 2003 for Pier Complex Replacement (P-032) at the waterfront area, Leonardo section, Naval Weapons Station Earle, New Jersey. The estimated value of this project is greater than $80 million.
 
This project includes the construction of a Berthing/Weapons Loading Pier and associated Trestle and the demolition of two existing piers.  The area of the new Pier will be approximately 12,000 square meters and the new Trestle 9,920 square meters.  Work will include the temporary strengthening of an existing pier, new construction of piers, crane and train rail systems, fender system, pier buildings, anti-terrorism/force protection system, tub/barge berths, dredging and waterfront related utilities. 

Based on congressional authorization and appropriation it is anticipated that this project will be funded over two to four fiscal years (a fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30).  The amount of funds available at the time of award will be disclosed in the RFP as will the anticipated allotment schedule for the amount of funds to be made available in the succeeding Fiscal Years.  A limitation of Government's Obligation section will be included in the construction contract.  

A Two-Phased Source Selection process including evaluation of technical and price proposals will be utilized for this procurement.  Phase 1 will consist of the request for, submission, evaluation, and (if necessary) discussion of a technical proposal.  No pricing is involved during Phase 1, however offerors will be required to provide evidence of bonding capability for projects exceeding $80 million.  The plans and specifications for this project are currently under development.  As part of the Phase 1 proposal process, offerors shall be required to participate in a constructibility review of the Progress Submission design documentation and provide the government constructive comments concerning their implementation.  The extent of the offerors participation in the constructibility review process and the associated quality/value of recommendations made shall be evaluated as part of the Phase 1 proposal review.  Other Phase 1 technical factors may include Relevant Past Performance and Safety Record.  Firms participating in the Phase 1 constructibility review process shall not be compensated for their participation.  No basis for claims against the government shall arise as a result of a response to this solicitation or to the Navy’s use of such information in developing the specification.  Please refrain from contacting the design consultant directly.  Offerors may be required to attend a constructibility review meeting with Navy personnel, the design firm or other project representatives and may be requested to provide supporting documentation as part of the RFP process.

Phase 2 of the selection process will consist of the request for, submission, evaluation, and (if necessary) discussion of both a technical and price proposal.  In addition to their price proposal, during Phase 2 offerors may be required to provide a project cost flow and construction timeline based on the assumption that funds will be available as required to provide for the most cost effective construction sequencing, while still meeting the operational needs of the Navy.  Other Phase 2 technical factors may include Commitment to Small Business Concerns, alternate dredge disposal options, and construction approach.  Contract award will be made to the firm offering the proposal considered most advantageous to the government price and other non-price factors considered. 

Employees and representatives of the selected firm performing work under this contract that requires access to the site are required to be United States citizens.  No employee or representative of the selected firm will be admitted to the work site without satisfactory proof of United States citizenship.

The contract will also include the clause titled "Evaluation of Options" (FAR 52.217-5) except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interest.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

A Bid Guarantee will be required to be submitted with the Phase 2 proposal in the amount of $3 million.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 237990 and the Small Business Size Standard is $28.5 million.  All contractors are required to register in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  Be advised, failure to register in the CCR makes an offeror ineligible for award of DOD contracts.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer (LBC) plans to procure services for analysis and preparing a database of human genes with young small interspersed elements (SINE) and large interspersed elements (LINE), evaluating age of the elements and annotating evolutionary young interspersed elements in available sequences of non-human primates. with Genetic Information Research Institute, 1190 Eureka Ave., Los Altos, California, 94024.  The supplies and services herein are being prepared in accordance with the authority authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $6M.    Alu family of short interspersed elements (SINEs) is a large family of mobile elements that have expanded to a copy number of 1,500,000 within the last 65 million years of primate evolution. Two of the most recently formed subfamilies of Alu elements have been termed Ya5 and Yb8.  Alu transposition is an ongoing process that continues this very day.  One of the main projects in LBC relates to Human Genome Initiative and includes isolation and characterization of gene homologs from great apes. The goal of this project is to study gene evolution in primates and to clarify a role of Alu repeats and other types of repetitive DNAs in genome stability, gene expression, and predisposition to certain diseases.  To achieve these goals preparing a database of human genes with young Alu and LINE integrations, evaluating age of the repetitive elements and annotating Alu and other young elements in available sequences of non-human primates is required. In addition, comparative analysis of entire gene homologs from primates is needed for specific genes containing young Alu integration. Detailed analysis of these DNA sequences will shed light on the gene evolution in primates and also provide information on role of Alu elements and other type of repeats in gene expression and stability.  More than one million SINE and LINE sequences will be analyzed.  Contractor Requirements:  The analysis includes the following steps: 1) Prepare a database of human genes with potentially destabilizing structures resulting from: integration of young Alus and LINEs elements.  From this dataset two sets shall be selected: (i) all genes with recent insertion of transposable elements and (ii) all genes harboring two or more highly similar copies of repetitive elements.  The database shall contain gene annotation and detailed description of potentially destructive interspersed repeats. The database shall be prepared in two formats: in the simple text format and in the standard database format SQL. The contractor shall use a public database system MySQL, widely used in genome annotations including Ensembl and UCSC GoldenPath; 2) Evaluate approximate age of all Alu Y elements in human genome and determine genes that have been targeted by retransposons approximately 5 Myr ago (date of divergence between human and chimpanzee), and after.  For this purpose a dataset from contractor requirement (1) shall be used. For every recent elements (Alu, LINE1, endogenous retroviruses) contractor shall estimate the age using divergence from the family consensus sequence (Alu, LINE1) or divergence between two long terminal repeats (retroviruses). In the case of Alu elements, CpG content shall be evaluated. This shall be combined with data on polymorphisms of repeats in the population, if available, using published works.  The database shall be prepared in the simple text and SQL database formats; 3) Annotate Alu and other young repetitive DNA elements in available sequences of non-humanprimates. Genomic sequences of other primates will be annotated for repetitive elements using Censor with Repbase Update libraries. The data shall be released as text and SQL. All genomic segments from primates shall be aligned with human genomic DNA. These alignments will be a basis for detection of all point mutations and indel breakpoints. The alignments shall be prepared by programs tailored for large genome alignments such as AVID or OWEN and; 4) Prepare a detailed annotation and analysis of repetitive DNA and unstable regions in human genes based on comparison with great apes gene homologs isolated in LBC, CCR, NCI. The annotation shall include the following human disease genes: DRD3 gene encoding dopamine receptor D3, breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, NBS1 gene responsible for Nijmegen breakage syndrome, tumor suppressor TP53, and ASPM gene that is a major determinant of cerebral cortical size.  The analysis shall be prepared as in (contractor requirement 3): first, identification of repetitive elements by Censor, then multiple sequence alignment with AVID or OWEN. The data shall be produced as text and SQL and alignment in the multiple Fasta format. All mutations and indels shall be highlighted and annotated in detail. This strategy should predict majority of potential at-risk motifs in the genes of interest. Genetic Information Research Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned services.  Dr. Jerzy Jurka is the Director of Genetic Information Genome Institute. Dr. Jurka is a world-recognized expert on interspersed elements in mammals. Based on his pioneering works, SINE and LINE groups of small and large interspersed elements were identified in human and mouse genomes and further were classified.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.

<CONTACT>Carolyn Makaena, Subcontract+Specialist, Phone xxx-xxx-xxxx, Fax 702-295-2639, Email Carolyn_Makaena@ymp.gov
<DESC>Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC), under Prime Contract No. DE-AC08-01RW12101 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE) on the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) in support of the Office of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), is seeking information from potential sources that can provide remote manipulator systems for removable radiological contamination surveying and decontamination.

The YMP is a monitored geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste that will be licensed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  In the course of normal operations, YMP will package the spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste in disposal containers, called Waste Packages (WPs) once they are loaded, sealed, and certified. 

Specifically, this Request for Information (RFI) seeks the following information:
 
- commercially available remote manipulators that could be used at the YMP for performing WP surface radiological contamination surveys and WP decontamination operations, 
- commercially available surface radiological survey equipment compatible with the remote manipulators,
- commercially available decontamination equipment compatible with the remote manipulators,
- sizes of, and space allocation requirements, for the remote manipulator systems including the survey and decontamination equipment suitable for the described applications.

Background

Physical survey of loaded and sealed WPs will be routinely performed prior to emplacement in the repository to determine levels of removable radioactive material contamination on exterior surfaces.  If necessary, WPs will be decontaminated to meet predetermined standards.  Extensive contamination of the exterior surfaces of WPs is expected to be infrequent, and a thorough decontamination of WPs prior to loading in the repository will be a non-routine operation, performed in a separate facility.

Because of the variety of waste forms, a number of different sizes of WPs will be used.  WPs will be cylindrical, with nominal diameters of 4’5”-7’0”, and nominal lengths of 11’5”-19’3”.  During surface surveys as well as decontamination operations, WPs will be positioned vertically, standing on one end (bottom).  There is no requirement for surveying or decontamination of WPs bottoms.
 The WP provides some radiation shielding, but not enough to keep occupational exposures within allowable limits.  Therefore, hot cells and remotely operated manipulators will be used for performing surface surveys and decontamination operations.

Surveying Waste Package Exterior for Removable Radiological Contamination

During routine operations, contamination of the exterior surface of loaded WPs is expected to be below levels of concern, and localized to small areas.  The contamination surveys will be conducted on all WPs. To adequately accommodate the throughput rates, survey performance and measurements to determine levels of contamination must support efficient operations (obtain, count, and record the results of swipes), and should not take longer than 2 hours.

A conceptual approach to the surveying operation is shown in Figure 1 (Page 4 of 4).   Consistent with typical methods, surveying for removable contamination would be performed by wiping the surface with muslin cloth for gross indication and with filter paper for quantification.  Five locations on each loaded waste package would be surveyed with muslin and filter paper: top, weld area, two opposite sides, and side near the bottom.  At least 10% of the surface area of each loaded waste package would be surveyed.  Survey muslin and filter paper would be passed out of the shielded cell via a special port and measured using portable instruments.

As discussed above, contamination of exterior surfaces of a WP is expected to be limited to small areas.  In the unlikely event that the exterior contamination approaches allowable limits, it is desired that the remote survey apparatus should be capable of performing repeated wiping of the contaminated areas, thus, providing a “limited decontamination” capability.  This would be an off-normal event, and the 2-hour time limit would not apply.

Decontamination of Waste Package

The contamination survey, as discussed above, determines the need for WP decontamination, and also provides a “limited decontamination” capability.  Excessive contamination of the exterior surface of a WP is expected to be infrequent.  If the contamination survey indicates excessive contamination over a large amount of the WP surface, a thorough decontamination of the WP would be warranted.  The WP would be moved to a dedicated decontamination hot cell where decontamination operations would be performed using remote manipulators.

The decontamination media could be either water or CO2 but, due to process restrictions, chemical solutions cannot be used to improve the effectiveness of decontamination in this particular situation.  Wiping and other drying methods (such as heat lamps) can be used to dry the WP.  

After decontamination, a survey of the WP will be performed to demonstrate whether the remaining contamination levels are acceptable.  Conceptually, the approach illustrated in Figure 1 for the routine WP surveys could be used for verification surveys in the decontamination cell.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Veeco Instruments, Inc. in Santa Barbara, CA for the purchase of  One (1) Veeco Instruments, Inc. Critical Dimension Atomic Force Microscope (CD-AFM) Model SXM.***Sole source determination is based on the fact that Veeco Instruments, Inc. is well known to be the only manufacturer in the world of  Atomic Force Microscopes capable of measuring line width by directional surface sensing. The Veeco Instruments, Inc. Model SXM features special directional sensing software, lateral tip control, and boot-shape tip geometry to achieve the directional surface sensing. Other commercial Atomic Force Microscopes use top-down sensing, which is less accurate for line width measurement and does not feature the required directional sensing software, the lateral tip control, or the special tip shape. NIST requires these special features to substantially upgrade the technology for doing line width metrology.  The instrument will enable NIST to perform traceable measurements for customers in the crucial microelectronics industry. ***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 30 days after receipt of order.

<DESC>The National Center for Education Evaluation (NCEE) of the Institute of Education Sciences intends to award a 4-year contract to a contractor to evaluate the impacts of using different professional development methods on changes in teacher practice and student achievement in early reading. While studies have looked at student performance using different reading programs, few studies have examined the impacts of different methods of professional development.  The purpose of this study is not to compare the effectiveness of different reading programs, but rather to determine what methods of providing professional development are most effective in improving teacher practice and student achievement.   The Department is particularly interested in conducting this work in high poverty schools as the focus of NCLB is improving the academic achievement of students in such schools.  Tasks will include: holding quarterly meetings with ED officials, developing a study website, establishing a technical work group and convening meetings, refining a management plan, refining the data collection plan, refining data analysis plan, creating data instruments (developing teacher survey instrument/ developing a form for collecting class student achievement scores/ developing a form for collecting information for a cost/benefit analysis/ field test instruments), identifying effective reading programs, contracting publishers of selected reading programs, select a district sample, developing professional development methods (training materials, field test the new materials, train professional developmen teachers), prepare and submit OMB package, identification of school sites (using random assignment of professional development strategies), collecting data, reporting to the Department and convening conferences and presentations.   Approximate date of release: May 28, 2003.  Approximate date of closing: July 13, 2003.

The CO intends to issue an RFP for an indefinite quantity indefinite delivery type contract for a base year and four option years, for a maximum of 500 course slots and 250 assessment instruments per year. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Requests for a copy of the RFP should be mailed to the address above or faxed to 202/283-1514. This procurement will be accomplished using FAR Subpart 13.5 procedures.  ESI is considered uniquely qualified to supply this requirement to the Treasury Dept. because it offers a comprehensive product spread that addresses the variety of specific Project Management Training Program requirements which Treasury has.  Furthermore, ESI International's product offerings are the most robust in the subject matter area known to the IRS and Treasury.   Treasury requires: (1) Public offerings, in the Washington, DC metro area, and preferably nationally, of the largest variety of Project Management and Contracting Management courses which teach the principles of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBoK) based on those concepts and principles as propounded by the Project Management Institute (PMI). Public offerings of all courses at the contractor’s location in the Washington, DC metro areas are necessary for two reasons: At any given time there would not be enough Treasury participants to fill many of the specialized classes.  Without the contractor offering courses on a regular basis, most of the needs beyond the core courses would not be met in a timely manner. Also, most of the prospective participants are in the Washington, D.C. area where no-cost classroom space is at a premium.  Given the life of the contract, the larger participants, such as IRS, would be unable to provide enough classrooms to meet the demand.  Renting classroom space would have considerable impact on the cost of the contract and would be inefficient.  (2) A Knowledge and Skills Assessment Instrument which has been validated for use as a tool to help in determining the skill level and training needs of those assessed.  (3) College level credit for the core curriculum.  (4) A program that offers Project Management Professional Certification (PMP).  The intent is to make this award by Sept. 15, 2003.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source procurement with the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE) to provide services to develop a National Roadmap for Fire Safety Design and Retrofit of Structures.  The objectives of this requirement include:  conduct research on current practice in the fields of fire safety and structural engineering by consultation with relevant US industry and international experts to develop topics for workshop theme papers that will underpin the technical basis for the development, conduct a two-day workshop to solicit input for the NIST National Roadmap, and use SFPE experts in structural fire safety to synthesize theme papers, participants input, and consensus positions for a strategic direction for the National Roadmap.  This sole source procurement with SFPE is justified based on their unique and broad base technical expertise and knowledge of national and international experts in the field of structural fire safety, their development/possession of standard calculation methods for structural fire protection, and their proven track record in advancing the science and practice of fire protection engineering by facilitating successful technical workshops, seminars, and conferences in the field of structural fire safety in a highly professional and cost-effective manner. 

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about May 28, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>59 - The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has an immediate requirement for a JITC certified small, lightweight, high power amplifier / low noise pre- amplifier (HPA/LNA) for use with the AN/PSC-5D multi-band 30-512 MHz radio.  Initial quantity of 80 each will include an additional 4-year ordering period for future requirements unknown at this time.  The contractor shall provide Integrated Logistical Support (spare parts) for a total eight (8) years from expiration of the standard commercial warranty period.  The Government intends to purchase these Amplifiers using Sole Source procedures.  The Request For Proposal is USZA22-03-R-0030 and will be issued o/a 14 May 2003.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334220 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  The amplifier will be installed onto various maritime combatant craft platforms in a very space-limited location.  Given the various conditions in which these platforms must operate, e.g., rough-seas, extended communications and operating ranges, the required amplifier characteristics and capabilities include: input power 22- 32 Volts DC, 100 Watt power output, Low Noise Figure (LNF) of less than 2 dB, size cannot exceed 3.5"(H) x 6.25"(W) x 12.25" (L) dimensionally to meet the rigid installation requirements on select combatant craft, weight no more than 10 pounds and must be able to withstand the harsh environments associated with operating on the open seas.  JITC certification for use with the AN/PSC-5D in accordance with MIL-STD-188-181B, 182A and 183 is required.  Based on a preliminary Market Investigation it appears that the only source that can satisfy this requirement is the Turtle Mountain Communications, Inc., TMC POS-TF100 Remote Amplifier/Pre-Amplifier.  See numbered note 22.  Questions from industry should be directed to the attention of Marc A. Duval at duvalm@socom.mil, (813)821-0560 ext 304.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

 The Department of Commerce (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) requires ongoing scientific and technical support for its Office of Research and Applications (ORA) site in Camp Springs, MD.  ORA is the office within NESDIS that provides guidance for the development and evolution of spacecraft and sensors to meet future needs.  Through its divisions, ORA conducts atmospheric, climatic, and oceanographic research on the use of satellite data for monitoring environmental characteristics and their change.  ORA plans, coordinates, and conducts research and development activities with other parts of NESDIS and NOAA and other Government agencies, universities and international groups.  ORA provides meteorological and oceanographic satellite products and services to users world-wide. 

This requirement is for scientific support, often at the Ph.D. or Master's degree level, with experience in remote sensing and interpretation of satellite data for weather, ocean and climate systems.  The Contractor shall provide scientific support for the design, development, testing, implementation, validation and documentation of algorithms for deriving atmospheric, oceanic and land surface variables from research and operational satellite observations.  This support shall involve occasional participation in field experiments including those on ships and aircraft platforms.  The Contractor shall participate in technical conferences where the results of this research are presented.  These services are currently performed by a staff of physical scientists including  meteorologists, oceanographers, hydrologists, physicists, engineers, mathematicians, programmers and system analysts.

This is a competitive 8(a) requirement.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541690 applies.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541690 is $6.0 million.  The Government contemplates awarding one fixed price contract for scientific and technical support services to a Section 8(a) source whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  The Government's estimated cost is $30 million over a five year period. 

The solicitation will be posted on the acquisition website listed below on or after March 21, 2003.  All inquiries should be submitted in writing by e-mail to Edith.L.Jones@noaa.gov or by faxogram to (301) 713-4155 referencing RFP No. DG133E-03-RP-0001. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>Solicitation Number F08620-03-Q-S723

The Purpose of this modification is to answer questions from site visit held on 1 May 03, revise the new due date for the proposal, and to establish a performance period.



1.  THE NEW RESPONSE DATE OR BID OPENING DATE WILL BE AT 4:00 P.M.  MAY 19, 2003

2.  THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD IS ESTABLISHED AS 60 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER NOTICE TO PROCEED HAS BEEN ISSUED.

3.  Response to questions on Commando Village Housing Area Site visit held 1 May 03

1.  Question:   How old is the average unit? 

Answer:
All units were built in 1990-1991. They were done as one project for 300 ea.  2, 3, and 4 bedroom apartments.

2.  Question:  How many times have the facilities been cleaned? 

Answer:
They were last cleaned about 3-4 years ago. The funds for the cleaning was not available when the last Housing Maintenance Contract was written, so that line item was dropped from the contract approx 3 years ago.
 
3.  Question:  Will contractor be required to go back if Tenants fail to acknowledge notice? 

Answer:
Yes, The contractor should make every effort to coordinate with the occupants for adequate cleaning times.  If there is no acknowledgement by the occupant, the QAP or the Contracting Officer must be notified. 


4.  Question:  Will Tenants be required to remove potted plants, patio furniture, vehicles, and animals out of work area? 

Answer:
Yes, The contractor should address all issues regarding the removal of personal property to include pets when they notified the occupant of the date and time their units will be cleaned.


5.  Question:  Will the contractor be limited to only the work hours between, 0800 – 1700 Monday through Friday?

Answer:
If the contractor wishes to work outside the normal hours they must provide a written request to the contracting officer at least 48 hours in advance for approval.

6.  Question:  Will there be any wage determination to this contract? 

Answer:
As specified in the synopsis, the Wage Determination is 94-2121 (Rev 23)

7.  Question:  Will all pets be housed [inside the homes] while workers are present? 

Answer:  
See Question #4, the contractor should address this when they notify the occupant. If they are informed that pets are to be removed from the work area then they should have them removed.


8.  Question:  If not, will this constitute a delay by the owner and an additional time allocation be awarded to the contractor? 

Answer:
If the occupant has not removed items from working area at the scheduled time, the QAP should be notified immediately.  If items are not removed in a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer will make a determination on a case-by-case base.  The QAP will make every effort to avoid delays by the occupant. 

9.  Question:  During the site visit, there were many articles, flags, bunting, signs, yellow ribbons, etc., that were attached to some of the units.  Will these be removed by the occupant prior to work starting? 

Answer:
See Question #4 - Again, the contractor is responsible for notifying the occupant of the upcoming work and identifies what items need to be moved.  

10.  Question:  Does the 76 units represent all of the units in Commando Village, or only selected units. A unit is one complete building, which in this case can either be a set of 2 or a set of 4. In other words, I am asking for all housing units, of which there are 300 apartments, which are contained within 76 units.  

Answer:
There are 74 quad-plex units and 2 duplex units, hence 76 units.

11.  Question:  Will the contractor be allowed to bill for initial start-up costs?  

Answer:
No, the initial start up cost is the responsibility of the contractor.  However, the contractor may bill once a month as partial payment for services completed. 


12.  Question:  Will the contractor be allowed to bill (bi-weekly or monthly) for partial services rendered?  

Answer:
See Question 11 above.  The contractor may bill once a month only for services completed. 


13.  Question:  Is there space available for safe storage of equipment? 

Answer:
 The lay down (storage space) area would be co-located to the tennis courts on Kanuha Drive. This area is accessible to everyone within the housing area.  If you wish to bring in some kind of large storage container for your equipment, please remember that all chemicals and fuel must be stored properly and not accessible to the occupants.  Most of the people in that area are children, so we would check that area for compliance often. 

14.  Question:  Have the units been cleaned ever? If yes what is the bid or contract history? 

Answer:
The last time they were cleaned was on the prior Housing Maintenance Contract, approx 3 to 4 years ago.
 
15.  Question:  What is the age of the vinyl siding if never cleaned? 

Answer:
Again, the units were built between 1990 and 1991, and yes they were cleaned approx 3 to 4 years ago.

16.  Question:  In response to F08620-03-Q-S723, Pressure Wash Commando Village, while preparing the documents for this bid, what specific bid forms do you require?

Answer: 
There is no special form to submit your bid, however, we utilize Microsoft products so what you provide must be compatible.  In addition you must include FAR clause 52.212.3 Offerors Representations and Certification Commercial Items, this clause can be found at the following web-site, http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  You will also have acknowledged that you’ve received all modifications pertaining to this solicitation.





17.  Question:  I would like to get a clarification on the wage determination 94-2121(rev 23).  This wage determination has no job description for a pressure washer.  The federal hires wage equivalent is
$14.89 hour.  Does this mean that we have to pay a minimal wage of $14.89 or do we get as close to the job description under the wage determination 94-2121(rev 23) as we can, and use that wage.

Answer:  
The federal equivalent is provided for information only.  You will need to visit the web-site www.dol.gov to determine the wage class or equivalent.  If you’re unable to locate the wage rate, then you will need to contact the Department of Labor for further guidance.

This will be a firm-fixed-price type contract for Amplifier Subassembly applicable to the ALR-56C system; NSN: 5996-01-230-8671; P/N: 319751-000. Basic Qty: 2 First Articles; 27 Production Units. Mission Essential Quantity (MEQ): 30 Production Units.  Option I: 1-89 Production Units. Option II: 1-89 Production Units.  
This is a competitive requirement with an Insurance Policy Buy for the MEQ to the proven source, BAE Systems, Yonkers, N.Y. 
This acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5352.217-9006 (Award of MEQ): The Government has determined that a break in the supply of this item (that is, failure to deliver due to timeliness and/or conformance) would jeopardize support to operational units' mission capability. Additionally, the item is of such complexity and/or so critical that first article testing measures are required for all unproven sources to ensure that the unproven source is capable of producing a conforming part. Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award the MEQ and, if necessary, the remaining balance of the requirement, to a proven source. In such event, the proven source must be a responsive, responsible offeror and also be the lowest in price of all proven offerors, price and price related factors considered. Therefore, two contract line items are provided to correspond with each of the two alternatives.  
The approximate solicitation issue date will be 7 Feb 03, with the approximate response date of 7 Mar 03.

Sources Sought Synopsis for the F-16 Head Up Display (HUD) Electronics Unit (EU) Request for Information

This announcement constitutes a request for information.  The Air Force plans to use performance based procedures to replace the existing Head-Up Display (HUD) Electronics Unit (EU) with a more reliable, longer life HUD EU that carries a warranty and has a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of at least 5,000 hours.  This procurement will use performance based acquisition specifications vice build-to-print requirements.  This procurement will be based on “best value” contracting, not necessarily lowest initial procurement cost.  The HUD EU will incorporate state of the art technology and will be compatible with existing hardware and software interfaces in order to maintain form, fit, function, and interface equivalence.  The information in this request is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting a market survey of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah.  This is not a Request for Proposal or an Invitation for Bid.

We are seeking contractors who are interested in producing a high reliability HUD EU using modern technology rather than traditional build-to-print requirements.  The F-16 Logistics Operations Division has a requirement for approximately 680 units.  The new HUD EU will replace the legacy HUD EU.  There are currently three operational versions of the HUD EU (NSN 1270-01-503-3099, P/N 51-036-10-94A; NSN 1270-01-480-8609, P/N 51-036-10-93A; and NSN 1270-01-473-8883, P/N 51-036-10-92C).

Interested parties are requested to submit a summary of the capabilities and facilities they have which will allow them to perform the development and manufacture of the new HUD EU.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and an estimate of the anticipated time between contract award and first production article delivery are also solicited to assist in the budgeting process.  The cost and schedule estimates are for planning purposes only and the contractor will not be bound by these preliminary estimates.  Please limit your response to twenty (20) pages.  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that procurement will be accomplished.  The Government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses must be submitted by 29 May 2003 to dale.kirtley@hill.af.mil.  No telephone or fax responses will be accepted.  A top-level drawing set describing the legacy HUD EU is available on CD.  Please contact dale.kirtley@hill.af.mil to request a copy of the CD.  Include a mailing address with your request. The Theory of Operations, Statement of Objectives, Performance Based Acquisition Specification, and the Test Plan are available at the Hill AFB business opportunities web site; follow the “Important Link to current information” link associated with this synopsis.

For answers to technical questions regarding this effort, please contact Mr. Tom Heaps at (801) 775-6394, e-mail Thomas.Heaps@hill.af.mil.  For answers to contractual questions please contact Mr. Dale Kirtley at (801) 777-5777, e-mail dale.kirtley@hill.af.mil.

A. INTRODUCTION: 

The Government intends to fund Mentor-Protege agreements by issuing contracts over three separate award cycles. The schedule for Round I is as follows:  Round I Proposals must be received no later than 14 February 2003, 3:00 PM, Central Time, in order to be considered for the initial round of awards. The initial award cycle will follow on or about 15 April 2003. The schedule for receipt of Proposals for Round II is 06 June 2003, 3:00pm Central Time and Round III is 15 October 2003, 3:00pm Central Time.  This BAA announcement will remain in effect until 15 Oct 03.  For additional Air Force Mentor-Protege Program Information, visit http://www.brooks.af.mil/HSW/BC/MP .

Proposals submitted in response to this announcement shall be submitted through the GSA web based Information Technology Solutions Shop (ITSS).  Contractors are responsible for registering with ITSS.  (http://it-solutions.gsa.gov)

The Government has reserved limited funding for 10 awards under an AF initiative restricted to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. 

B. OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this DoD program is to incentivize DoD contractors to assist small disadvantaged business (SDBs) in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements, and to increase the overall participation of SDBs in the DoD market place. The objective is to help foster the relationship between the two parties to increase the industrial supplier base and enable SDB transition from sub- to prime contractors. An additional intent is to increase subcontract opportunities under the Mentor's contracts, DoD contracts, other government agency contracts, and commercial contracts.

Under this program, companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible SDBs to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance their protege capabilities in the technology areas listed in this BAA under Section D. The anticipated developmental assistance areas shall include: technology transfer, engineering and technical matters such as production, inventory control, quality assurance, and any other assistance designed to develop the capabilities of the protege firm under the development program. A complete description of the program and eligibility requirements are provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).






C. APPROACH: The Government intends to use a competitive Two Tiered approach under this announcement.

TWO-TIERED COMPETITION

The Two-Tiered initiative applies to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. The AF envisions these Protege(s) shall qualify within half the size standards of the stated NAICS in Section D. The mentor and protege firm shall agree upon a proposed technology (IAW Section D of this announcement) and outline their approach to Tier One activities in a 10-page White Paper. This White Paper will serve as the proposal for teams wishing to participate in the Two-Tiered approach. During Tier One the HBCU/MI shall evaluate the protegees business needs, conduct market research, and produce a business plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of the agreed upon technology. During Tier One the Business Plan will be completed and a program review conducted. Teams progressing into Tier Two will be down-selected based on program review analyses. The AF will request an expanded White Paper from those teams demonstrating progress and achievement of the stated goals during Tier One. Tier Two will focus on implementing technology transfer and business infrastructure improvements identified during Tier One. The expanded White Paper will serve as the Tier Two Program Plan and must include a detailed schedule, program goals and expected posture at the end of the program.  Award dates under this initiative may differ from the full and open competition. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

	The GSA intends to award contracts with eligible mentors in accordance with the DoD Mentor-Protege Program. The period of performance for the Two-Tiered contract will be six months from date of award for Tier One and 18 months for Tier Two. Offerors shall provide proposed costs and supporting documentation for the 6-month period of performance only.

The Two-Tiered proposals must demonstrate team compatibility and established mutual goals prior to submittal. The Tier One efforts will comprise an in-depth business needs evaluation, market research, and result in a Business Plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of more advanced technology. Tier One activities shall focus on preparing the Protege to accept a specific technology, within the identified thrust areas, to be transferred during tier two.

A. INTRODUCTION: 

The Government intends to fund Mentor-Protege agreements by issuing contracts over three separate award cycles. The schedule for Round I is as follows:  Round I Proposals must be received no later than 14 February 2003, 3:00 PM, Central Time, in order to be considered for the initial round of awards. The initial award cycle will follow on or about 15 April 2003. The schedule for Round II receipt of proposals is 13 June 2003, 3:00pm Central Time and Round III receipt of proposals will be 15 October 2003, 3:00pm Central Time.  This BAA announcement will remain in effect until 15 Oct 03.  For additional Air Force Mentor-Protege Program Information, visit http://www.brooks.af.mil/HSW/BC/MP .

Proposals submitted in response to this announcement shall be submitted through the GSA web based Information Technology Solutions Shop (ITSS).  Contractors are responsible for registering with ITSS.  (http://it-solutions.gsa.gov)

The Government has reserved limited funding for 10 awards under an AF initiative restricted to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. 

B. OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this DoD program is to incentivize DoD contractors to assist small disadvantaged business (SDBs) in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements, and to increase the overall participation of SDBs in the DoD market place. The objective is to help foster the relationship between the two parties to increase the industrial supplier base and enable SDB transition from sub- to prime contractors. An additional intent is to increase subcontract opportunities under the Mentor's contracts, DoD contracts, other government agency contracts, and commercial contracts.

Under this program, companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible SDBs to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance their protege capabilities in the technology areas listed in this BAA under Section D. The anticipated developmental assistance areas shall include: technology transfer, engineering and technical matters such as production, inventory control, quality assurance, and any other assistance designed to develop the capabilities of the protege firm under the development program. A complete description of the program and eligibility requirements are provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).






C. APPROACH: The Government intends to use a competitive Two Tiered approach under this announcement.

TWO-TIERED COMPETITION

The Two-Tiered initiative applies to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. The AF envisions these Protege(s) shall qualify within half the size standards of the stated NAICS in Section D. The mentor and protege firm shall agree upon a proposed technology (IAW Section D of this announcement) and outline their approach to Tier One activities in a 10-page White Paper. This White Paper will serve as the proposal for teams wishing to participate in the Two-Tiered approach. During Tier One the HBCU/MI shall evaluate the protegees business needs, conduct market research, and produce a business plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of the agreed upon technology. During Tier One the Business Plan will be completed and a program review conducted. Teams progressing into Tier Two will be down-selected based on program review analyses. The AF will request an expanded White Paper from those teams demonstrating progress and achievement of the stated goals during Tier One. Tier Two will focus on implementing technology transfer and business infrastructure improvements identified during Tier One. The expanded White Paper will serve as the Tier Two Program Plan and must include a detailed schedule, program goals and expected posture at the end of the program.  Award dates under this initiative may differ from the full and open competition. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

	The GSA intends to award contracts with eligible mentors in accordance with the DoD Mentor-Protege Program. The period of performance for the Two-Tiered contract will be six months from date of award for Tier One and 18 months for Tier Two. Offerors shall provide proposed costs and supporting documentation for the 6-month period of performance only.

The Two-Tiered proposals must demonstrate team compatibility and established mutual goals prior to submittal. The Tier One efforts will comprise an in-depth business needs evaluation, market research, and result in a Business Plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of more advanced technology. Tier One activities shall focus on preparing the Protege to accept a specific technology, within the identified thrust areas, to be transferred during tier two.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, Technology Division (MCWL-TD), Quantico, VA is issuing this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for a contract for a two-phased approach to design and build a prototype vehicle.  The vehicle must prove internally transportable in the MV-22 aircraft; have diesel fueled (or a diesel/hybrid variation) propulsion, capably operate as a weapons platform to mount and employ an M2, .50 caliber and MK19 40mm machine gun (one weapons station that is interoperable with either machine gun).  Additionally the vehicle must carry, as a minimum a crew of three (driver plus 2 crewmen) and must be able to operate in all environmental conditions and all terrain types.  

Fully developed requirements for this type of vehicle do not exist, therefore, no documentation will be made available on the below cited web site.

This is intended to be a two-phase program.  The first phase is the vehicle design phase.  The second phase is an option for the prototype vehicle build phase.

We are interested in approaches that fully utilize the most current and advanced vehicle design and prototype build technology available.  Additionally, given the impending fielding of the MV-22 in FY06, we are interested in vendors capable of expeditious completion of this work, having a thorough knowledge of all aspects of vehicle design, and having the personnel, design tools and vehicle production capability available immediately.

The offeror is directed to the following website where specific proposal submission information is provided under solicitation M67854-03-R-9019:  http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/ctq/alsv.asp.

The closing date for this BAA will be 1400 on 6 June 2003.   The Marine Corps intends to make one award pursuant to this Broad Agency Announcement, but reserves the right to make no awards under this BAA.  The final deliverables of the contract for Phase I must be submitted no later than 120 days after contract award.  The deliverables of the contract for Phase II must be submitted no later than twelve (12) months after initial contract award.  The entire MCWL budget for this effort to include both Phases is no more than $2,800,000.

Industry with experience in prototype vehicle design and build, hardware production and computer aided vehicle design are encouraged to participate.  The Contracting Officer for this BAA is Lynn Y. Frazier, telephone (703) 432-0349, facsimile (703) 784-5826 and e-mail frazierly@mcsc.usmc.mil.

<DESC>NA The intent is to negotiate on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basic with Pennington Biomedical Research Laboratory (PBRL) for scientific and professional consultative and technical laboratory services to support The Military Operational Medicine Re search Program's biomedical research program on military operational nutrition.  This research program consists of basic and applied research to identify nutritional strategies to optimize Warfighter health and performance.  Research is conducted by invest igators at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine and uses both animal models and human volunteers in experimental studies.  Experiments aim to assess nutritional status of test subjects during exposure to stress and nutritional interve ntions, and involve measuring appearance, disappearance and steady-state levels of metabolites, nutrients and other biochemical substances in various human and animal tissue samples, complemented by measurements of dietary and nutrient consumption of volun teer military personnel engaged in garrison or operation training.  The PBRL Clinical Laboratory for Human and Food Samples will receive and process samples of biological material, to include human and animal tissues and food samples for subsequent biochem ical analyses as determined required by USARIEM investigators in consultation with PBRL laboratory personnel.  PBRL scientists will advise USARIEM investigators regarding sample collection procedures and assist with interpretation and preparation of analyt ical results for publication in professional journal and presentation in scientific symposia.  The PBRL Stable Isotope Laboratory will provide laboratory analytical and professional scientific support for the conduct of experimental procedures involving th e use of various stable isotope-labeled substances in the measurement of whole body energy expenditure, protein turnover, carbohydrate and fat oxidation in humans.  PBRL scientific staff will advise USARIEM investigators during research planning, collabora tively conduct experimental procedures and subsequent analytical laboratory analyses of isotopic enrichment, and assist in the interpretation of results for scientific presentation and publication.  The PBRL Nutrient Database Integration Laboratory will as sist USARIEM investigators in assessing food intake of military subject populations during both in-house laboratory and garrison or field research studies, and the subsequent conversion of recorded food intake data into nutrient intake data.  The period of  performance shall be for five years.  No telephone requests.  Any offeror purporting to be able to furnish the requirement in accordance with the conditions stated herein must submit a written response demonstrating such capability.

<DESC>The Department of Defense Electronic Mall (DOD EMALL) Team is submitting the following Request for Information (RFI) regarding Custom Pack And Ship (CPAS) services.  The objective of the DOD EMALL evaluation will be to assess tools or technologies that manage the transportation movement in support of OCONUS customer shipments and consolidation of CONUS orders into single shipments.  These tools should address the five focus areas:  1) receiving; 2) cross-docking; 3) short term storage; 4) pick and packing; and 5) shipping.  The CPAS should allow the OCONUS and CONUS DOD EMALL customer to receive items purchased in a shopping cart in a single shipment.  Tools should: contain a catalog that describes the services offered; support the customer in requesting a CPAS price for a specified set of services for a specific set of items in a shopping cart; allow collaboratively priced services; report status on the shopping cart once per day after the first item is received at the CPAS supplier’s location; and provide in-transit visibility.  Customers will review the proposed shipping costs based on destination and weight and optional special packing requirements and elect to accept or reject the proposed shipping arrangements.  The proposed price will become a line item in the shopping cart in cases where the customer accepts the proposal.  The DOD EMALL is interested in finding Carriers or VENDORS of commercial transportation tools or technologies, who are experienced in the movement of commercial goods to government customers in OCONUS and are willing to consolidate CONUS shipments.  Based upon the responses to this RFI, the DOD EMALL Team will select the appropriate tools and systems for assessment.  If you or your organization is involved in the area of distribution within OCONUS and consolidation of CONUS shipments, please refer to the procurement and contracts web site listed below.  Further information concerning the details of DOD EMALL can be found on the DOD EMALL website, http://www.emall.dla.mil.  Request interested parties submit a capabilities statement not to exceed 20 pages, single spaced to Ms. Brenda Geist (brenda.geist@dla.mil) no later than 2:00 p.m., 13 June 2003.

<SUBJECT>B -- Drug-eluting stent population follow-up study
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center of Devices and Radiological Health
(CDRH) intends to award a contract to the American College of  Cardiology (ACC) for the project entitled “ Drug–eluding stent population follow-up study.  The mission of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health is to promote and protect the health of the public by ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and the safety of radiological products.  In fulfilling this mission, it is important to use the most extensive health data available to monitor the postmarket safety and effectiveness of new devices and technology. Clinical trials conducted premarket are necessary to show the safety and effectiveness of a new device. However, data on the long-term follow-up of patients may be limited. Due to the short-term nature of much premarket clinical data, long-term postmarket data are essential to monitor the safety and effectiveness of devices in the clinical setting. Limited follow-up of the premarket studies may leave unanswered questions as to the experience of devices over time.  CDRH is interested in collaborating with the ACC to study the long-term follow-up of patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary interventions. The main objectives of this study would be to gather information on the prevalence of use of various devices in coronary interventions.  Information will be collected on factors such as patient demographics, cardiac risk factors, coronary revascularization, and angiographic findings.  In addition, this study should describe possible long-term device-related adverse events such as aneurysm, thrombosis, MI, and malapposition.  The ACC should provide a proven, independent mechanism by which to collect long-term patient data.  This institution should have a mechanism where the data are comprehensive and collected nationally, from multiple centers.  The statutory authority for this action is 41 U.S.C. 253 © 1 as set forth in FAR 6.302.  The closing date of this announcement is May 28, 2003.  The NAICS is

<SUBJECT>A -- Gene Silencing Method
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES TO COMMERCIALIZE GENE SILENCING METHOD

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's gene silencing method.

Scientists at LLNL have invented a novel method to silence gene expressing by using a novel short interfering nucleic acid molecule.  Because of its unique composition, the novel molecule can exert superior gene silencing functions than short interfering RNA (siRNA or RNAi) molecules.  For example, it is well known that siRNA (or RNAi) cannot silence a gene without a transfection mean or an internally expressed vector.  It has also been widely accepted that siRNA (or RNAi) cannot silence gene expression in bacteria. However, scientists at LLNL have successfully used the novel molecule to silence gene expression in bacterial and mammalian cells.  Uniquely, the novel molecule can silence genes without using any transfection medium; simply adding it to the growth media is sufficient to induce gene silencing.  Furthermore, the novel molecule is more potent than siRNA (or RNAi), both in duration and magnitude.  

Experiments at LLNL proved that under the same conditions, the novel molecule silenced a target gene for more than two weeks while siRNA (or RNAi) silenced the same gene for about two days.  These experiments also proved that a relatively lower concentration of the novel molecule is needed than siRNA (or RNAi) to achieve the same level of gene silencing.  With these special characteristics, the novel molecule is an ideal candidate for new antibiotics, antiviral agents, fungicides, and therapeutics for diseases relating to undesirable gene expression. It will also serve as a powerful tool to study gene expression and functions.

LLNL has taken necessary procedures to protect the invention.  A patent is pending for the invention.  

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's gne silencing method should provide a written statement of interest including a commercialization plan and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000022-03.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's subject gene silencing technology.

<SUBJECT>A -- Joint Urban Operations Request for Information
<DESC>This synopsis is to announce a U.S. Joint Forces Command request for information (RFI) on Joint Urban Operations (JUO) automated models.  The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from industry and academia on the current availability or near term availability of automated models that portray the intricacies of JUO.  The objective of the U.S. Joint Forces Command is to use JUO models to examine new and emerging joint operational and tactical urban warfare concepts, technologies, and alternative command and control architectures and their impact on military operations.  
The U.S. Joint Forces Command, Joint Experimentation Directorate has recently been designated as the executive agent for JUO and seeks industry and academic input on ‘state of the art’ models that could more realistically portray the modern urban battlefield.  As this is a relatively new area of exploration, it is understood that few, if any existing models will have all of the characteristics addressing the JUO problem set.  The U.S. Joint Forces Command is seeking models that can address one or more of the following urban warfare characteristics: Physical, Infrastructure, Commercial, Residential, and Socio-Economic.  Physical  information is the most basic characteristic in defining an urban area.  Ideally, models would address the four basic levels:  building, street, subterranean, and air, creating a three dimensional environment.  Specific characteristics could include building interiors, weather, kinetic and non-kinetic effects.  Infrastructure information includes water distribution facilities, medical services, sanitation procedures, waste treatment plants, environmental hazards, communication capabilities, power grids, and gov’t and non gov’t facilities and organizations.  Specific characteristics could include: transportation, communications, water, power networks.  Commercial information includes business centers, outlying industrial/agricultural features, as well as environmentally sensitive areas.  Specific characteristics could include traffic and crowd behaviors.  Residential information includes all housing quarters from squatter settlements to suburbs, as well as community facilities such as churches, schools, museums, public transportation, police/fire stations and hospitals.  Specific characteristics could include representation of the various types of housing quarters.  Socio-Economic information includes the population demographics, ethnic/cultural enclaves to include political/religious tension and conflict.  Specific characteristics could include multi-sided crowd behaviors and decision aids.  This request is for information only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government may arise as a result of the submission of industry information.  Those interested in responding to this RFI should submit their responses to USJFCOM J9 (Attn:  Jim Blank), 1562 Mitscher Avenue, Norfolk, VA 23551-2488.  Information should be submitted by no later than 13 June 2003.  Questions concerning this RFI should be directed via e-mail to jim.blank@je.jfcom.mil.

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to award a sole source contract to Acquisition Services Consulting (ASC) Group, Incorporated/1869 37th Avenue/San Francisco, CA/94122-4144 for the SeeSor/TF Software uses structured, replica ble, automated tools for preparation of a contractors performance evaluation process and execution of post award monitoring and administration. The procurement includes training, proprietary software license, and technical support for this proprietary soft ware. The proposed sole source nature of this action is based on the following: (1) An immediate need for the use of ASC Groups proprietary software, with associated training and technical support, for use in contractor performance evaluation and contract administration activities in connection with the recently awarded Logistic Support (LS) and Integrated Range Engineering (IRE) Support contract for the U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) and the Reagan Test Site in the Republic of the Marshall Islands; (2) The SeeSor/TF Software system is the only automated contractor evaluation/QA/contract administration tool that is compatible with the USAKA LS & IRE contractÃ¢Â€Â™s Performance Work Statement (PWS) and associated line-item costing infrastructure. This is d ue to the fact that the solicitation, Performance Work Statement, evaluation, source selection, and contract award for the USAKA LS & IRE contract were structured and based on ASC Groups proprietary software. This prior usage and incorporation of ASC Group s proprietary software was accomplished via prior contracts with ASC over the last three years; (3) The  SeeSor/TF Software was developed by ASC Group at their own expense and is proprietary to  them; and (4) Based on the foregoing, the Army has determined  that the award of this requirement to any source other than ASC Group would necessitate a costly and time-consuming re-structure of the massive (maximum value of approximately $2.6 Billion) USAKA LS and IRE contract. Such re-structure would result in exte nsive duplication of prior government investments of time and dollars, thereby causing unacceptable delay and disruption in contract operations and administration at USAKA and large additional costs to the government which could not be recovered through a relatively low-dollar value competition of the underlying software tool. The response to this synopsis is 15 days. Vendors interested in sub-contracting opportunities may contact the above named sole source directly. Any other responses to this synopsis sh ould be sent to the attention of Ms. M.D. Batts, md.batts@smdc.army.mil within the 15-day response time.

ADD – V(ah) - The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the vessel's  INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.
