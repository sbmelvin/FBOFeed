<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Newport Corporation of Irvine, CA for the acquisition of a Velocity Tunable Laser System to be used by the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
<p>NIST currently owns and utilizes three (3) Velocity laser systems. These systems work in conjunction with each other and independently on various experiments currently underway. A unique, customized software was developed by NIST, to control and calibrate the different functions of the existing Velocity lasers, and also integrates the lasers with other pieces of existing laboratory equipment, such as a waveform generator, motorized stages, photodetectors, optical attenuators, and sample temperature control. The purchase of the Velocity Tunable Laser system from Newport Corporation is crucial to ensure the compatibility to the unique, customized, software as well as the compatibility of the existing Velocity Laser Systems. If another manufacturer's equipment were purchased, it would be a detriment to the Federal Government, as new software would be required to be developed to control and calibrate the different manufacturer lasers. The time, effort and money involved in developing the new software would cost the Government a significant amount.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by February 16, 2011 will be considered by the Government.</p>
