<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Current SATCOM Earth Terminal (ET) communications are implemented using an analog architecture, with conversion from digital data to analog signal occurring in the modem. CERDEC STCD initiated a technology development program, Future Advanced SATCOM Technologies (FAST), in FY 12. The FAST architecture moves the analog portion of the ET architecture closer to the antenna, and implements a number of formerly analog functions using a digital architecture. The concept is to digitize the full receive spectrum at Intermediate Frequency (IF) and digitally process to provide separate digital interfaces to the modems. The full spectrum IF uplink will be converted to analog for input to the block up converter.</p>
<p><br />SCOPE</p>
<p>The US Army Communications Electronics Research &amp; Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) Space &amp; Terrestrial Communications Directorate (STCD) is interested in receiving information from companies that have experience in the design, development, and implementation of satellite communications systems, real time/embedded systems, modems, high speed digital interfaces, and open standards. CERDEC STCD wishes to identify potential sources for the implementation of a Digital Modem for use in an all-digital satellite communications terminal.</p>
<p>A Digital Modem Interface Standard was developed under the FAST program. This standard will be used and verified under the Digital Modem for SATCOM development effort.</p>

The information used to adjudicate benefits is primarily paper-based, and USCIS is digitizing the paper files. Ensuring the digitized information is accurate, current, and reliable and of high quality is necessary before the digitized information is released to adjudicators and stakeholders. Once digitized, the electronic images are uploaded to a central data repository identified as the Enterprise Document Management System (EDMS) and the digitized images are accessible and viewable to internal and external users.</p>
<p>USCIS requires quality assurance and program support services to assist the Government personnel who oversee records management and digitization operations at a contractor-owned facility where Records Digitization Services are provided.</p>

When the digitizing contractor's quality standards are substandard, the results of process monitoring will allow USCIS to identify specific deficiencies and take appropriate action to ensure that government interests are protected.</p>
<p>The government forecasts that approximately 25 million images will be digitized annually.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a full and open competition among 8(a) vendors. This is a re-compete. This contract will have a one-year base period with two (2) one-year option periods.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Boulder, Colorado intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Laser Design Inc (LDI), , Minneapolis, MN 55431 USA, for the purchase of an extended System Warranty on our WS-Series scanning system for 1 year, with 4 optional years of continuous coverage. The warranty shall cover parts, labor, software updates, technical support (email, phone, and live on-line web assistance with ability to control our machine remotely), technician's time and expenses, system calibration, and factory calibration of laser under other than full and open competition.
<p>NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />(2) Only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The system was purchased from LDI. It is a proprietary system, both hardware and software. The service requires intimate knowledge of the hardware and software, with on-line live support for the operation of the system. LDI has developed and written the software that controls the system and no one else would have access or full understanding of the software. They also control the software licenses on the system. To our knowledge, no one else could provide this service. As a result, Laser Design Inc is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Boulder, CO.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541330 Engineering Services, and the size standard is $4.5M.<br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by the response date above. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to leonard.spakow@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

Expressions of Interest Sought
Requirement:

The US Department of Veterans Affairs currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Miami, FL, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 14914 contiguous net usable square feet (NUSF) of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 14,500 to a maximum of 14,914 contiguous NUSF. The lease term requirement is for a term of Ten (10) Years, Five (5) Years Firm. The space must be available for occupancy by April 1, 2013. Space within or fronting on the following boundaries will be considered:

NORTH: NW 36TH STREET
EAST: BISCAYNE BOULEVARD
SOUTH: SW 8ST STREET.
WEST: NW 22ND AVE

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<a href="mailto:chantal.m.rosales@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - RTP</a>
<DESC>This serves as a Notice of Intent issued via the Army Contracting Command (ACC), Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Research Triangle Park (RTP) division in support of the United States Army Materiel Command, Army Research Laboratory (ARL). The intent of this action is to increase the overall contract ceiling under the ARL III Multiple Award (MA) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awarded on 30 November 2010 to the following seven (7) Contractors: Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) (W91CRB-11-D-0001), Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) (W91CRB-11-D-0002), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) (W91CRB-11-D-0003), Exelis, Inc. (formerly known as ITT Corporation) (W91CRB-11-D-0004), Northrop Grumman (W91CRB-11-D-0005), Wintec Arrowmaker Incorporated (W91CRB-11-D-0006), and Technical and Project Engineering (TAPE) (W91CRB-11-D-0007) respectively.  <br>   <br> The ARL III MA contract was awarded with a contract ceiling of $400,000,000 over a five year ordering period. The contract currently has less than $150,000,000 of ceiling with less than 3 years remaining under the existing ordering period. The intent of this action is to increase the contract ceiling in order to allow adequate time for a follow-on contract to be competed without interrupting the agency's mission to support these activities. Based on the current schedule of the ARL III MAC IDIQ, an increase of $80M is required. The Army intends to increase the ID/IQ contract ceiling to $480M for the seven (7) ARL III Multiple Award contracts  under the authority of Title 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. <br>  <br> The ARL III MA IDIQ contract vehicle utilizes Research and Development (R&D), Operations Maintenance and Administration (OMA) and Other Procurement Activity (OPA) to provide rapid response capabilities and support to special operations, stability operations, intelligence and irregular warfare. The basic contract was issued on an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity basis in accordance with FAR 16.504. Task Orders are issued in accordance with FAR 16.505 entitled Ordering.   <br> The scope of the contract allows the contractor to furnish personnel, facilities, equipment and supplies to perform services including studies, technical investigations, research, development, experimentation, limited acquisition and logistics support for items and systems supporting upgrade and modernization of U.S. Army, United States Special Operations Command, other Government Agency and Department of Defense capabilities in expeditionary warfare, irregular warfare, special operations, and stabilization / reconstruction operations. The current global environment has stressed the need for these agile capabilities far beyond what has been experienced during the past management of this contract.  Consequently, use of the contract has exceeded historical rates, which may lead to the ceiling being reached prior than the expiration of the contract period of performance of 30 November 2015. The additional ceiling amount of $80,000,000 is necessary to bridge the gap between reaching the contract ceiling and the award of a follow-on contract. This will prevent unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirements of those critical organizations and other units being supported by the Government through this contract. <br> This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District, will be issuing a solicitation in 2013 for removal of dredge material from transfer sites located in Upper Mississippi River Pool 4. Traditionally the Corps has awarded contracts for this type of activity via an invitation for bid (IFB) that provided detailed plans and specifications regarding the method, route and ultimate destination for the material to be removed. The Corps is currently considering alternate methods of accomplishing the removal of material from the transfer sites. One of the methods being considered is a sealed bid solicitation that specifies a performance requirement to remove and dispose of a given volume of material to a location (or for a use) identified and determined by the contractor. Upon removal of the dredged material, the contractor would take title to the material to be disposed of and is free to use or dispose of the material in any lawful manner. The traditional disposal sites provided by the Government <strong>would not</strong> be available for use by the contractor. This alternative solicitation method would leave it to the contractor to determine the most cost effective method of disposing of the material appropriately. The contractor would be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits and approvals to dispose of the materials removed or put them into some other use.<br /><br />Regardless of the method of removal, the Corps is still required to evaluate the reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of undertaking this work. It is anticipated that the Corps will prepare an environmental assessment which will consider, among other things, the reasonably foreseeable means by which the material will be transported from its present location to mainstream commerce (i.e. commercial port, rail or highway) or disposal facility. To assist our preparation of the appropriate environmental documentation, the Corps will be seeking information from interested parties regarding potential means of removal and transportation of the dredged material and general information regarding its ultimate use or disposal location.<br /><br />As part of this input process, the Corps will provide additional information regarding the characteristics of the material to be removed. That information will made available on an "as is" basis for the benefit of potential bidders and the Corps of Engineers does not warrant that all the material will be as described nor the suitability or marketability of the material to be removed for any particular purpose. We anticipate making that information available on or about January 7, 2013. The Corps will also issue a brief survey to gather some general information regarding interest in the material and general removal and transportation methods. The Corps is also interested in receiving additional information that the industry believes the Government should consider in structuring this solicitation.<br /><br />This notice does not constitute a solicitation. This announcement and the information gathering associated with it are for planning purposes only. The acquisition methods for this project and others of a similar nature have not yet been determined. Response to this notice is strictly voluntary. The Government will not reimburse any interested party for costs incurred for providing a response to this request. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used by the Government to help determine the scope of its environmental review and will likely be incorporated, at least in generic form, into our environmental documents. Information provided may also be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Those responding to this survey are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge or provide feedback to any information submitted under this notice.

<CONTACT>Berniece Washington, Contracting Officer, Phone 7034320982, Email berniece.washington@usmc.mil
<DESC><p>United States Marine Corps Expeditionary Energy Office<br />Notice of Brief to Industry on Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Sources (MEHPS)</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>At the Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB) demonstration conducted during the summer of 2010, the Marine Corps evaluated and then deployed to Afghanistan the first ever hybrid power system. This highly successful deployment of hybrid power led to the initiation of the Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Sources (MEHPS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). MEHPS is conceived to be a non-grid-tied smart power system with output ranging from 300W to 800kW. The results of the MEHPS AoA are expected to define the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs) of the future MEHPS family of systems. Ultimately, these hybrid systems will augment traditional generators on the battlefield and are expected to yield significant fuel savings, increase combat capability, "lighten the load," and reduce the risks to deliver logistics on the battlefield.</p>
<p>On 31 January 2013, the USMC Expeditionary Energy Office (E2O) will brief industry on the results of the MEHPS AoA and the Marine Corps planned way ahead. The following topics will be addressed:</p>
<p>&bull; Power requirements (distinct power demand bands, transportation limitations of each power demand band)<br />&bull; Power profiles used to evaluate alternatives and sensitivity analysis<br />&bull; Modeling created to analyze MEHPS performance and results<br />&bull; Generic results that frame the system attributes within the MEHPS family of systems <br />&bull; Impact of renewable energy, battery storage, and non-grid-tied micro-grids at the various levels of the MEHPS power demand bands</p>
<p>Hybrid power systems continue to be of interest to USMC and will be the focus of the next Experimental Forward Operating Base demonstration (ExFOB 2013-1) in the spring of 2013. Industry is encouraged to attend the brief on 31January for the purpose of gathering information in order to respond to a forthcoming Request for Information (RFI) for ExFOB 2013-1.</p>
<p>EVENT DETAILS</p>
<p>The brief to industry will take place at Marine Corps Base Quantico, The Clubs at Quantico, 3017 Russell Road, Quantico, VA 22134. Check-in for the brief will begin at 11:30AM EST on Thursday 31 January 2013. The brief will begin at 12 noon EST and will last approximately two hours.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 7 years, and 4 weeks after 11 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within twenty (20) working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br>  <br> 	HQ Army Materiel Command	 <br> 	Office of Command Counsel <br> 	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 <br> 	Ft.

Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm. <br />(c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability Web site ( http://www.hhs.gov/od ).<br />(d) Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 accessibility standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government- i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense.<br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br> (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br> (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C.  362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br> (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.
