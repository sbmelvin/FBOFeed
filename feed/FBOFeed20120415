<p><br /><strong>STATEMENT OF WORK</strong></p>
<p>PART 1<br />GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p><br />1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION <br /><br />The mission of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is to prevent death, disease, and injury from mining and to promote safe and healthful workplaces for the Nation's miners. MSHA administers the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), the Miner Act of 2006 and enforces compliance with mandatory safety and health standards as a means to eliminate fatal accidents; to reduce the frequency and severity of nonfatal accidents; to minimize health hazards; and to promote improved safety and health conditions in the Nation's mines. <br />The Office of Employee Safety and Health (OESH) was established within MSHA to help managers furnish a safe and healthful work environment for MSHA employees. The OESH oversees three functions for MSHA employees: (1) Safety and Health programs, (2) The Workers' Compensation Program, and (3) The Medical Review Section, which evaluates physical exam results to make determinations on medical clearance for enforcement and other designated positions. <br />The OESH utilizes medical standards and functional requirements to determine the suitability applicants for and incumbents in enforcement and other designated work positions. Applicants and employees must be physically capable of performing arduous duties efficiently and without hazard to themselves or others. Medical examinations are required for all applicants of positions that involve regular or intermittent performance of inspection, investigation, rescue duties, or duties involving mine site visits. Medical conditions that constitute a hazard to safe and efficient job performance are disqualifying. The presence of medical disorders that would be aggravated by the environmental conditions of these positions and thereby hinder safe and efficient job performance are also disqualifying. MSHA requires employees whose positions fall under medical standards to undergo a complete physical examination at a frequency of once every three years, or more frequently if a fitness-for-duty question arises. MSHA requires Mine Rescue team members to have a physical examination every year.<br /><br />1.1 OBJECTIVES:<br />The objectives of this effort are to:<br />1. Identify and evaluate physical demands and functional requirements of the routine duties of enforcement and other designated work positions;<br />2. Implement appropriate medical standards consistent with physical work demands and functional requirements of enforcement and other designated work positions, in accordance with applicable regulations, guidelines, and best medical practices;<br />3.

<p>&nbsp;<br />PART 6<br />APPLICABLE PUBLICATIONS</p>
<p><br />REFERENCES, LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES</p>
<p>At a minimum, Contractor performance in accordance with the requirements herein shall fully comply with the following laws, regulations, policies and guidelines:</p>
<p>&bull; Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002 - Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)<br />&bull; The Privacy Act of 1974, PL 93-579, as amended<br />&bull; OMB Circular A-123 Revised, Management's Responsibility for Internal Control, December 2004<br />&bull; OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, July 23, 1993<br />&bull; OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources<br />&bull; Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, Policies for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors<br />&bull; Department of Labor, Computer Security Handbook (CSH)</p>
<p><br />The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement:<br />- 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (FEB 2012)<br />- 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition, with the following addendum to paragraph a:<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>A. Technical Capability<br />1. Experience<br />2. Understanding of the Requirement<br />B. Past Performance<br />C. Price</p>
<p>The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than Factor C, Price. However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor A, and its associated sub-factors. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br /><br />The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule.</p>
<p>Sub-factor 1: EXPERIENCE - The Government will evaluate the offeror's experience in relation to current or previous work performed in similar size and scope to this requirement as well as the experience of Key Personnel. <br /><br />Sub-factor 2: UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT - The Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in the SOW and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated.</p>
<p><br />PAST PERFORMANCE: The Government will evaluate past performance of three (3) previous contracts for current relevancy (within 3 years), with at least one (1) previous or current contract with relevancy within the past 12 months based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollar value, scope, and complexity. Offerors are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the offeror and the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision. The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sectors. For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance. The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire, Attachment 1. Offeror's shall distribute the questionnaire included in the solicitation as an attachment to their references so the form can be completed and submitted directly to the Government.</p>
<p>Performance. Offerors shall provide a specific narrative explanation of each contract listed in Section 1 describing the objectives achieved and detailing how the effort is relevant to the requirements of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(a) For any contracts that did not/do not meet original schedule or technical performance requirements, provide a brief explanation of the reason(s) for the shortcomings and any corrective action(s) taken to avoid recurrence. The offerors shall list each time the delivery schedule was revised and provide an explanation of why the revision was necessary. All Requests for Deviation and Requests for Waiver shall be addressed with respect to causes and corrective actions. The offerors shall also provide a copy of any Cure Notices or Show Cause Letters received on each contract listed and a description of any corrective action implemented by the offeror or proposed subcontractor. The offerors shall indicate if any of the contracts listed were terminated and the type and reasons for the termination.</p>
<p><br />New Corporate Entities. New corporate entities may submit data on prior contracts involving its officers and employees. However, in addition to the other requirements in this section, the offeror shall discuss in detail the role performed by such persons in the prior contracts cited. Information should be included in the files described in the sections above.</p>
<p>Past Performance Questionnaire. The offeror shall complete Part I of the Past Performance Questionnaire and e-mail the questionnaire to the Government and private sector technical representative responsible for the past/current contract. The POC's shall be instructed to electronically complete Part II of the questionnaire and e-mail the entire questionnaire to the Contract Specialist, Worrells.deborah@dol.gov no later than <strong>May 2, 2012 at 4:00 p.m. EST.</strong> The offeror shall also e-mail to the Contract Specialist a list of all the POC's who were sent a questionnaire. The Government must receive this list no later than <strong>April 27, 2012 at 4:00 p.m. EST</strong>. The POC List shall be submitted in Word for Windows Table Format to include the following fields: Solicitation Number; Company Name; Contract Number; Government Agency; POC Last Name, First Name; POC Title; POC Telephone Number; POC E-Mail Address; Date E-Mailed to POC (month/day). Please note, that the Past Performance Questionnaire will not be a part of the resultant contract.</p>
<p>PRICE. The offeror shall complete Schedule B (Cost/Price Schedule), with pricing for the base and each option period.

No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factors I, Technical (See Table 1), Adjectival ratings for Factor II (See Table 2), Past Performance will be Low Risk, High Risk, and Unknown Risk. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.</p>

<DESC>Q: How far apart is KAB Building #400 and Okuma Recreation Facility<br />Building #129? Is this the Recreation Facilities located in the northern<br />part of Okinawa and maintained by Kadena Air Base?
<p>A: The Okuma Recreation Facility is located on the northwest shore of<br />Okinawa near Hentona which is approximately 83 kilometers from Kadena AB.<br />The Okuma Recreation Facility is a detachment of the 18th Force Support<br />Squadron at Kadena AB, Okinawa, Japan. Network services for the Okuma<br />Recreation Facility business operations are provided and maintained by the<br />18th Force Support Squadron's Information Technology Branch at Kadena AB. <br /><br />Q: What is the present existing link between bldg 400 and bldg 129 (fiber<br />or copper)?</p>
<p>A: The current circuit is a commercial Powered Ethernet 3Mb point-to-point circuit run over fiber.</p>
<p>Q: Being an airbase, is there a restriction to wireless transmission in the<br />area? Does the transmission path cross a runway?</p>
<p>A: A wireless solution is not an acceptable solution due to the additional security measures that must be implemented to have wireless communications within a cardholder data environment to maintain compliance<br />with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).</p>
<p>Additionally, there are restrictions for wireless transmissions. All emitter equipment and frequencies must have Host Nation Approval prior to use.</p>
<p>Q: Are towers allowed to be erected if required?</p>
<p>A: Towers might be allowed on the Kadena AB and Okuma Recreation Facility propers with prior coordination and approval by appropriate base agencies. Due to the distant between these two sites and no direct line-of-site, towers would also have to be erected off the base propers which is completed outside the U.S. government control.</p>
<p>Q: Do the two (2) locations have towers already or have high (tall)<br />buildings for line or near line of sight?</p>
<p>A: No.</p>
<p>Q: What are the coordinates of the two (2) locations?</p>
<p>A: Unknown.</p>
