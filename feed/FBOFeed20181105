<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of an Advanced Link Analysis and Monitoring (ALAM) Tool for Ship Shore Ship Buffer (SSSB). The tool will provide real-time analysis of the waveforms used by Link 11 and Link 22 that are critical to the correct operation of such Tactical Data Links (TDLs).
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) within the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>Execution of the proposed contract will require unescorted access and work of contractor personnel at NATO Class-II security areas. Contractor personnel will be required to hold individual security clearances at the level of NATO SECRET. The company selected to perform the resulting contract is responsible for ensuring that DOD issues the NATO security certificates that are required.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-14896-SSSB, and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>The NCI Agency will award the contract for the lowest priced technical compliant bid. This will be a single Firm Fixed Price contract with expected duration of approximately 15 months. The NCI Agency plans to place a single contract with one contractor. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for U.S. NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.<br />U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities">http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): November 21, 2018</p>
<p>- NCIA issues IFB (target): January 2019</p>
<p>- Bid Closing (target): May 2019</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): August 2019</p>

<DESC>1. Introduction to TBFM and Program History

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA or Agency) is initiating the development of an Enterprise Automation Strategy (EAS).  The strategy will consider both Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) requirements and end-of-life considerations to recommend a timeframe for replacement of NAS automation systems.  While the Agency is initiating activities to define program and system requirements for a replacement system or group of systems, it is imperative to sustain and enhance present systems.  

To acquire, field, and operationalize these systems could take from 10-15 years, especially considering both the complexity of the systems themselves and the complexity of replacing them.  As part of this overall effort, the Agency has a requirement for the continued system integration, sustainment, and enhancement of Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) during the 10-15-year period as discussed below.

At some point in the future, new requirements or system,software performance degradation will likely necessitate the need to replace the TBFM platform in its entirety. The expectation is that a competitive procurement approach would be used at that time.

The NexGen organization will periodically access future requirements and the impact to the existing automation systems so that if the need to be replace the existing system is determined, it will be identified years in advance to allow for the formulation and execution of the new program.

At this time, there is no technical requirement necessitating a replacement of the TBFM platform. The FAA is currently initiating a process for the development of an Enterprise Automation Strategy. The strategy will consider both NextGen requirements and the end-of-life considerations to recommend a timeframe for replacement of these platforms.

The FAAs Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) provides the vision and roadmap for modernizing the National Airspace System (NAS) to meet future air traffic demands.  The execution of this plan involves the research, development and deployment of new Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems, technologies, and decision support tools to meet these growing demands safely and efficiently.   Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) will build upon previous TBFM work packages to deploy existing capabilities to additional locations in the NAS, and provide new capabilities to enable/support the Performance Based Navigation (PBN) Navigational Strategy (NAS) 2016.  This Work Package will incrementally improve metering to further advance the use of PBN operations. It will also broaden the deployment of existing enhancements and capabilities that increase throughput and efficiency, particularly during periods of high traffic demand.  Existing capabilities include functions such as Integrated Departure/Arrival Capability (IDAC) and Terminal Sequencing & Spacing (TSAS).  New candidate capabilities are planned to include Path Stretch, TBFM Dashboard Planning Tool, and Improved TBFM-TFMS Data Integration.   

Integrated Departure & Arrival Capability (IDAC) provides for the identification of flights requiring TBFM departure scheduling and graphic depictions of available departure slots. IDAC provides situational awareness to ATCTs so that they can select from available departure times, request a release time, and plan their operation to meet these times. This situational awareness will be provided for various TBFM environments, from standard single departure airport departure flows to departures from multiple airports merging over a common departure fix as well as departures merging into an overhead flow.

Terminal Sequencing & Spacing (TSAS) extends the scheduling capability into the terminal area. It provides arrival management guidance to TRACON controllers consistent with the schedule that En-Route controllers are striving to attain at arrival meter fixes. To achieve more precise arrival delivery, procedures are joined to approaches to provide a continuous, defined path in the terminal down to the runway threshold. There is wide availability of Required Navigation Performance (RNP) approaches with curved paths providing additional efficiency, and controllers will be able to accommodate RNP-capable aircraft along those procedures, in addition to efficiently managing non-RNP capable aircraft, even during busy traffic periods.

The FAA anticipates the award of a new follow-on contract for the existing TBFM/Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) contract in 2020. This contract will continue the design, development, testing, implementation, operation and maintenance of the TBFM/TBO system.  The TBFM follow-on effort will involve both the upgrading and maintenance of existing software as well as the development and implementation of new enhancements.  The contract would include provisions for program management, systems engineering, quality, system design, system development, test, training, implementation, integrated logistics support, and system upgrades. The Government maintains data rights for all software necessary to sustain and enhance TBFM.

The scope of the anticipated new contract includes:

1.  Sustainment of existing TBFM baseline system to include maintaining current software, adaptation, documentation and addressing newly identified problems 
2.  Re-architecture of the system to include porting to a new platform and Client/Server based architecture for information sharing 
3.  NextGen enhancements to the system to include design, development, test and implementation of requirements as defined in the TBFM SSD 
4.  Engineering Services and Site Support as defined per the SOW, Section C.10 
5.  Future changes will support TBFM Technical Refresh, Interval Management (IM), and Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM)


2. ASPECTS FOR NEW TBFM CONTRACT

The FAA will use the information received from this market survey to determine if there is viable industry competition for a new procurement for sustaining and enhancing TBFM. Listed below are the associated aspects intrinsic with sustaining and enhancing the TBFM system.  

a.  TBFM System Availability Requirements. Any TBFM outage has a significant impact to NAS efficiency and likely results in significant delays and monetary impacts to the aviation industry and passengers. As such, the objective is to provide continuous service for Core TBFM Services and expeditiously respond to and resolve TBFM site issues impacting service availability. Some TBFM Services are anticipated to be identified by the FAA as meeting the Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RMA) category of Efficiency-Critical.  As a result, the award of the new TBFM contract must not result in increased risk to satisfying the anticipated TBFM System Availability Requirements (0.9999) and overall NAS capability and availability. 

b.  Proficiency with TBFM Development Environment Tool Sets. The TBFM Development Environment includes DOORS (requirements management) and FlightDeck (adaptation development, scenario development).  FlightDeck is a software package that is common to En Route Automation development and is an essential element of the entire TBFM architecture (It is an integral part of the TBFM Maintenance and Control (M&C) subsystem, supporting a variety of functions).  The Development Environment contains the tools needed to deliver the TBFM system software, documentation, and support tools for each TBFM software release.  Therefore, the TBFM development team for the new contractor must be proficient on all of the TBFM tool sets.  The TBFM Program Office also anticipates that there will be a new requirement for the contractor to utilize the FAAs Automation Issue Management System (AIMS) to manage Change Requests and Problem Reports. 

c.  Limited Overlap with TBFM Incumbent. Transition must be accomplished as soon as possible.  The Government plans for a limited overlap of the existing contract with the award of any new contract. This anticipated duration is constrained by budget and Government resources limitations.


d. Comprehensive Software Design Knowledge of TBFM Software Code for Maintenance Support: The new contractor must be capable of providing full coverage of all operational software in order to respond to possible system software issues impacting system availability. The FAA does not intend for the current TBFM System Architecture to be changed from its current configuration.  For latent software defects impacting service, the new contractor must be capable of determining the problem and developing the necessary field fixes so that the impact to the operational systems can be remedied as soon as possible. 


e.   Programming Languages used in the TBFM System. The CSCIs within TBFM are primarily written or coded in ANSI C89 (ISO/IEC 9899:1990), C++ and Java, running under the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system.  The new contractor must be able to staff personnel capable of maintaining sole responsibility for sustaining the TBFM software once the overlap period with the existing contract incumbent is over.  The FAA intends that all software modifications be performed in a timely manner, as requested, with minimal replacement/revision of the underlying code.


f.  Comprehensive Engineering Knowledge of the TBFM System to Support TBFM System Service Restoral. The new contractor must provide a group of system engine
eers, system architects and software architects that have a detailed knowledge of all aspects of the TBFM system design, including the detailed software functionality and relationships within the design, and its external interfaces. The contractor will be responsible for 24/7/365 TBFM second-level engineering support in the case of the loss of service or a significant problem at any TBFM site. This group must support 24/7/365 availability of the Help Desk and be capable of quickly assessing the problem, identifying solutions, coordinating with the site to restore operational service as quickly as possible in order to minimize the impact to the NAS and ATC services.


g.   Comprehensive Engineering Knowledge of the TBFM Software System to Support Design and Integration of New Enhancements. The new contractor must be capable of engineering services tasks that support engineering, analyses, design, development, implementation, maintenance, training, additional site deployment and upgrade of TBFM or related systems.  These engineering services may include but are not limited to the following: directed engineering studies, prototyping designs of specific subsystems and analysis of new alternatives for a specific subsystem.  The new contractor must also be capable of developing solutions that integrate new NextGen capabilities into the existing TBFM or related system.  Future software enhancements to the TBFM system that introduce new capabilities and improve performance of services are anticipated and the new contractor must maintain existing waterfall(s).  The work required to deploy these new enhancements is expected to begin as early as 2020, with incremental implementation within the first year.  New enhancements will need to be delivered to selected sites no later than 2022 in support of FAA milestones.  The work needs to be efficiently implemented soon after the new contractor is selected.


h.   Knowledge of TBFM Hardware and Support for Technical Refreshment Milestones. The new contractor must have detailed knowledge of all aspects of the existing TBFM hardware. The TBFM system is currently maintained using two levels of hardware maintenance: Site and Depot. Site hardware maintenance consists of preventive maintenance, checks and services, and corrective maintenance. Corrective maintenance tasks are performed to restore service to the system. Corrective maintenance tasks must not invalidate OEM warranties. Depot maintenance consists of repair and replacement of components returned from the sites and replenishment of expendable equipment ordered by the field.  Changes in Integrated Logistics Support posture (i.e., workshare of maintenance typically performed by the FAA and the contractor) are anticipated as part of the new contract award.  In addition to ongoing hardware support requirements, a Technical Refreshment effort is planned for existing TBFM hardware.  The work required to deploy replacement equipment is expected to begin as early as 2020 and be delivered no later than 2023; therefore the work needs to be efficiently implemented soon after the new contractor is selected.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Sole Source firm-fixed price purchase order to Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (Mesa Labs), at Lakewood Manufacturing Facility, 12100 W 6th Ave, Lakewood, CO 80228, in accordance with the authority under FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). This procurement is being conducted under simplified acquisitions procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The NAICS code is 811219 - Laboratory instrument repair and maintenance services.<br /><br />FDA's Arkansas Laboratory Microbiology Branch has a requirement for the service and maintenance of a Temperature Monitoring System manufactured and supported by Mesa Labs. Temperature is an analytical parameter that influences the outcome of many methods utilized in the regulatory laboratory. As such, it is critical that the laboratory accurately document the performance of numerous instruments in the laboratory with regard to temperature stability. Arkansas Laboratory uses the Mesa Labs (formerly TempSys) CheckPoint &copy; by Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (CheckPoint) automated wireless temperature monitoring system to meet requirements for monitoring analytical critical control points in accordance with its ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation along with AOAC International guidelines and Office of Regulatory Science (ORS) Quality Management System. Each of the temperature probes comes with a unique snap calibration connector that only fits Mesa Labs' wireless transmitters. Because this system is proprietary, all calibration of temperature probes must be performed by CheckPoint personnel. Mesa Labs is the only authorized calibration laboratory certified by the Perry Johnson Laboratory Accreditation, Inc. to provide calibration services for CheckPoint System's probes. A service agreement is required to maintain the system, troubleshoot, and provide calibrated probes annually for this wireless temperature monitoring system. No other vendor can provide this service and maintenance without voiding warranties currently being honored by Mesa Labs. For these reasons, an award to Mesa Labs is intended.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This notice is not a request for competitive quotes</span>.</strong> However, any party that believes it is capable of meeting the requirements as stated herein may submit a written response, i.e. capability statement, which clearly supports and demonstrates its ability to perform the requirements.

<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Acquisitions, Riverside Five, 8490 Progress Drive, Suite 400, Frederick, MD 21701-4998.</p>
<p>Note: This synopsis follows Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) notice that was released on January 16, 2018 under HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-TSB-87001-94.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span></strong></p>
<p>The Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) provides genomic characterization services through several Genomic Characterization Centers (GCC) to NCI programs and deposits the resulting data in the Genomic Data Commons, a large-scale database of cancer genomic data for public use.</p>
<p>This is a non-Research and Development, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) requirement, which will provide for firm fixed unit price type task orders to be placed. This solicitation will include three separate IDIQ pools (DNA characterization pool, RNA characterization pool, and Protein characterization pool).</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to acquire high-resolution, systematic, comprehensive (genome-wide) characterization services of cancer-related genomic alterations. The contractor(s) shall function as a fundamental resource and play a key role in the CCG research programs. Key goals shall include ensuring that standards are developed, implemented, continually improved, and maintained to support the entire genomic characterization pipeline. Study variables shall be minimized with rigorous Quality Assurance/Quality Control of all parts of the operation.</p>
<p>The contractor(s) shall offer the types of characterizations using validated methods in a high-throughput fashion at the start of the project. The biomaterial for these studies (DNA, RNA, or Protein) will be provided by the Biospecimen Processing Centers (BPC) of CCG. The aim is to have all molecular characterizations conducted on biomolecules from the same biospecimens for optimal analytical integration for data comparability.</p>
<p>The contractor(s) shall support all genomics projects with following services in scope:</p>
<p>1. Receive biomaterial from BPC <br />2. Operate molecular characterization pipelines <br />3. Improve and optimize performance of characterization pipelines<br />4. Implement quality control procedures <br />5. Support informatics and data delivery <br />6. Perform transition activities</p>
<p>Multiple awards are anticipated for each pool, although not every offeror who submits a technically acceptable proposal will necessarily be chosen for award. It is estimated that approximately ten IDIQ base contracts will be awarded, among the three IDIQ pools.</p>
<p>This is an existing requirement currently supported through subcontracts that were awarded under the Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contract number HHSN261200800001E, the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, operated by Leidos Biomedical Research, with a period of performance of 09/26/2008 - 08/30/2019. The contract is entitled "Operations and Technical Support Services at NCI-Frederick" at the FFRDC.</p>

<p>&bull; The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard = 15X054, 6/24/2015 - 8/30/2019<br />&bull; MD Anderson Cancer Center = 15X140, 6/19/2015 - 8/30/2019<br />&bull; University of North Carolina = 16X250, 11/17/2016 - 8/30/2019<br />&bull; Stanford University = 17X029, 1/1/2017 - 8/30/2019<br />&bull; Baylor University = 17X184, 10/25/2017 - 8/30/2019</p>
<p>The solicitation is anticipated to result in up to ten IDIQ contracts being awarded across the three pools (DNA, RNA and Protein). Each base IDIQ contract will be for five years with awards anticipated on or before July 31, 2019 to offerors capable of performing the work. This advertisement does not commit the United States Federal Government to award any contract. The 2017 NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $15.0 million. THIS ACQUISTION IS UNRESTRICTED (NOT A SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES).</p>
<p>The Request for Proposal (RFP) N02CO87001-94 is scheduled for electronic release on or about 11/20/2018 and receipt of proposals will be due at 3:00 pm ET on or about 2/18/2019.

This procurement is classified as Total Small Business set-aside in accordance with Part 19 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). <br />
<p><br />The goal of USAID's Judiciary Against Corruption Activity (JACA)&nbsp;is to support more effective, independent and accountable justice actors, and the purpose is to strengthen selected justice sector institutions to combat corruption, economic and organized crime.</p>
<p>Two main components of the activity are:</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Corrupt behavior in the BiH justice sector prevented.</p>

<p>USAID will issue an RFP around November 20, 2018. Please do not consider this pre-solicitation announcement as an RFP and do not submit your proposals until the formal RFP is released. Award of this activity shall be made subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement&nbsp;of FAR 5.203(a).</p>

The USGS operates the Boulder magnetic observatory at Table Mountain, CO.  There is an office building, an absolutes building, a variations building, two test cubes, a coil control building, and a coil building on site.  This project concerns the coil building, which is 309 square feet.  The scope of this effort is to build an addition on the east side of the existing coil building and to perform various interior improvements to the existing structure.  The addition is planned for approximately 162 interior square feet (approximately 190 footprint square feet) and should match the existing building in terms of structure and appearance.  Two (2) concrete instrument piers will be built in the addition.  The contractor shall be responsible for all design, construction, necessary permits, etc. resulting in a completed structure ready for USGS use.  Project schedule shall accommodate USGS design review at the 65% and 95% milestones.  Additionally, final as-built drawings will be required.

The design and associated data of the ADG is owned by Hamilton Sundstrand (HS) and was never purchased by the government. Currently the government has limited rights to this data, which means that HS is the sole source for acquisition purposes (subsequently licensed the Turbine and Gear for manufacture and government sales to UNICAL, Cage 7CNG1). The government has Technical Orders that initially detailed the overhaul and repair criteria for the ADG, but over the years it has not been updated and cannot be used as the official document to control this activity. <br /><br />See the Attached Sources Sought Synopsis package for additional details.</span></span></p>

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /> <br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability and type of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting this potential government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.   Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method including small business socio-economic set-aside possibilities and to determine the availability of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's potential requirement.  All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with size standard 1000 employees.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>The Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation (DPI) at NCATS plans, conducts and uses both internal and contract resources to advance collaborative research projects across the pre-clinical phases of the translational science spectrum. The DPI is developing 3-D tissue models that more closely mimic the complexity of tissues in the human body in a reproducible, automated and scalable manner using bioprinting techniques to better predict how potential new drugs will affect humans. The tissue models are used for compound testing and could accelerate drug development for treatments of both rare and common diseases. NCATS launched the 3&#8209;D Tissue Bioprinting program to improve the predictive success of pre-clinical drug development,. NCATS researchers are using the techniques of 3-D bioprinting to combine living cells with scaffolding materials, to create testing platforms of laboratory-grown human tissues that closely mimic natural tissues in human organs. These innovative tissue models could help scientists better predict the way patients will respond to potential new therapies.</p>
<p>Specifically, DPI is focused on developing a 3D tissue of blood retina barrier (BRB) to mimic pathological conditions in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using bioprinting technology and patient specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this model, biodegradable scaffold plays a role as a substrate of both retina pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and bioprinting of choroid tissue including choriocapillaris. This scaffold is considered as a temporary Bruch's membrane, which is the basement membrane located between RPE and choroid. Bruch's membrane allows molecular interaction between RPE and choroid, and its thickness is about 2~4 &micro;m. In wet form of AMD, vessel growth from choroid, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), compromises Bruch's membrane and RPE. Engineered tissue requires capability to show CNV and cell-to-cell interaction. To achieve these aims, the scaffold thickness is required to be as thin as Bruch's membrane, and the half-time of biodegradation needs to be approximately one month to allow cell communications during tissue development. In wet AMD model, these features of scaffold thickness facilitates access of molecules secreted by RPE to printed choroid, and biodegradation helps CNV development to reach RPE layer.<br /> <br />Purpose and Objectives<br />This Small Business Sources Sought notice seeks to determine eligible sources capable of achieving the essential features of this potential requirement. The purpose of this potential requirement is to obtain biodegradable poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PDLGA) scaffold. Electrospun PDLGA scaffold is required for building multi-tissue layers including vascularized tissue and epithelium to mimic blood retina barrier (BRB), which requires pore size control, biodegradation period, retaining mechanical strength and bioprinting capability with bioink including multi cell types and epithelial cell monolayer formation. Biodegradation of scaffolds will be required for cell-cell communications and cell migration in disease models. An additional manufacturing step is required to get the final products of precut scaffolds with 10~12mm diameter, which will facilitate and accelerate the bioprinting process.</p>

In States where HUD is responsible to administer an installation program, the Department will ensure that manufactured housing installers are trained and licensed and will administer an inspection monitoring program for those States. In these States the Department has the authority to enforce all the regulations outlined in the Manufactured Home Installation Program (24 CFR Part 3286). In States that are approved to administer their own programs, the Department is responsible to review the state programs on a regular basis and is responsible to ensure that each state enforces installation standards that provide protection to manufactured home residents that equals or exceeds the protection provided by the Department's Model Manufactured Home Installation Standards (24 CFR 3285) and is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to solicit responses from capable sources and capability statements to ensure sufficient competition exists to meet the government's requirements.</p>

<DESC>The Department of State is conducting market research to determine the degree of interest and capability by U.S. Small Businesses only in providing surgical and non-surgical medical services in support of U.S. mission located in Mogadishu, Somalia. The Bureau of Medical Services (MED) is responsible for medical support to nearly 100,000 federal employees, family members, and other eligible persons overseas.  Nowhere is the provision of comprehensive medical support more important than a critical threat post like Mogadishu.  To meet these responsibilities, a contracted medical service support contract is required. The NAICS code for this requirement is 621493 and Product Services Code Q201.

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile Directorate of Contracting (DOC) is seeking information regarding capability and availability of potential contractors to perform an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Facilities Operation, Maintenance, and Support Services for the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6 (NAMRU-6). The Mobile DOC proposes to issue a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC).</p>
<p>The proposed service contract is intended to provide operation and maintenance of medical research facilities and support structures and components in a continuous and satisfactory condition on a 24 hour basis, 7 days per week. Requirements include preventive, predictive, demand, and emergency maintenance of all facility systems and components, including but not limited to architectural, mechanical, electrical, and instrumentation. Janitorial services at specified facilities may also be included in task order requirements. Minor construction and limited design incidental to the O&amp;M mission may also be required. Total capacity over the potential five year life of the contract (base year plus four one-year options) is $4,000,000.00. Individual task orders will be negotiated and awarded as firm-fixed price actions.</p>
<p>The proposed contract will support NAMRU-6 facilities and systems, primarily centered in Peru, but including geographically dispersed satellite facilities located mostly in Central and South America. Work will require knowledge of the functional operation of medical research facilities, relating to the efficient use of the facility, equipment, facility support systems, and building structures. Since the facilities will be in full operation, the contractor will be required to minimize interference with the daily operation of the laboratories and support facilities, and will be required to comply with requirements of a number of regulatory and accrediting bodies such as the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). The facilities to be covered by the intended contract include Bio-safety Levels (BSL)-2, and 3 research laboratories and laboratory support functions, vivarium facilities, administrative spaces, parking areas and structures, and supporting systems and utilities. The performing contractor's personnel may be required to meet security and health screening requirements. In addition, there may be facilities or portions of facilities that require medical testing and/or immunization of Contractor employees, beyond basic OSHA requirements, before the employees are authorized to work in the controlled room, area, or facility. This requirement may be due to the containment requirements in bioresearch laboratories, the potential for exposure of workers to toxins or communicable diseases, etc.</p>
<p>The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to determine the availability of qualified contractors to perform these services. The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to these requirements is 561210, Facilities Support Services. The Small Business Size Standard is $38.5 Million. Offerors are requested to respond to this sources sought synopsis with the following information, which shall not exceed 10 pages:</p>
<p>1. Offeror's name, address, points of contact, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses. <br />2. Offeror's capability to perform, to include logistic complexity, and facility/project size. Biomedical research facility operation and maintenance experience is desired. Operation and maintenance of a single building system (HVAC, electrical, etc) is not considered indicative of experience in full service facility operation and maintenance. <br />3. Offeror's business size to include designation as Certified Small Businesses, 8(a) contractors, HUBZone Certified Small Business Concerns, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Women Owned Small Businesses, and Large Business Concerns. For 8(a) Contractors, please include proposed graduation date from the 8(a) Program. <br />4. No more than five (5) projects that are at least 50% complete within the past five years that demonstrate their capability to perform the type of work described above. Project information is not to exceed 1 page per project and should include title, location, general description of the project, Offeror's role, dollar value of the project, and name of the company, agency or Government entity for which the work was performed with contact information (reference name, phone number and email address).</p>
<p>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 20 November 2018. ALL RESPONSES MUST BE EMAILED to SAMCT.LATAM@usace.army.mil, and sara.g.logsdon@usace.army.mil.

<p>The NIACS CODE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT IS 236220.</p>
<p>The following types of services are required: The contractor shall install animal drinking water capability, which is compatible with the existing system, in the following rooms:<br />(6) Interconnects in room F2205A<br />(6) Interconnects in room F2205C<br />(8) Interconnects in room F2213A<br />(8) Interconnects in room F2213B<br />(8) Interconnects in room F2213E<br />(8) Interconnects in room F2213F<br />(8) Interconnects in room F2221A<br />(8) Interconnects in room F2221B<br />(8) Interconnects in room F2221E<br />(8) Interconnects in room F2221F</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide and install Pressure Reducing Stations, equipped with auto-flush and monitoring features, a shut-off valve and an injection port for system sanitization, and furnished with a stainless-steel cabinet. The locations and number of stations shall be determined by the contractor. The interconnect stations shall each be equipped with a detachable 6' hose with stainless steel quick disconnect couplings, including a clean joint stainless-steel piping room distribution piping system, &frac12;" brackets and mounting hardware. The contractor shall install stainless steel flush valves at terminal ends of the distribution system with an extension of the stainless-steel piping to a sink or floor drain within the animal room. The contractor is responsible for install design and determining required conduit and pipe sizes. The contractor shall be responsible for installing all required piping, conduit, cable/wire, hangers and supports as required. The contractor shall include all low voltage cable, fire sealing, conduit sealing, insulation, labelling, tagging, fittings, boxes, associated equipment and piping. All penetrations and wall mounted equipment to be sealed with low odor, neutral curing, and silicone. Silicone sealant must also be: non-staining, mold, mildew resistant and architectural grade. All work is subject to inspection, approval, and acceptance by the COR. The contractor shall include in their proposal the necessary engineering, hardware, software, labor, materials, tools, equipment, ductwork, cabling, conduit, EMT, configuration, professional service...etc., to provide a complete project.

<p>Additionally, listed below are the features of the automated watering systems:</p>
<p>&bull; 316L grade stainless steel pipe, which is passivized, and electro polished to help it withstand the harsh environment of an animal facility. 316L stainless steel is also a better suited material to withstand high purity reverse osmosis water.<br />&bull; There are no glued fittings or welded joints to assemble in the field. The clean joint acts like a sanitary fitting to eliminate any seams or crevasses for water to enter and stagnate. Therefore, biofilm has less of an opportunity to get a foot hold.<br />&bull; Female and male quick disconnect fittings are also manufactured from 316 grade stainless steel, including the female quick disconnect fitting.</p>
<p>This office believes that only one source, AVIDITY SCIENCE, LLC, can provide all of the above required support.

If no affirmative written documentation is received within 15 days of this synopsis, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers will proceed with AVIDITY SCIENCE, LLC, as the required vendor for use by our prime contractors. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided.

This criteria will continue to be refined based on technical developments and warfighter feedback. All changes and updates will be made available to industry accordingly.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Selection and Award: </span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Proposed solutions will be evaluated using the CSO process. Technical priorities to consider when conducting design trade-off analysis include rucksack packability, ease of employment, reliability and endurance to consistently execute the mission, as well as unit cost. </span></p>

The pitch phase will consist of an in-person pitch as well as a flight demonstration. The in-person pitch will be conducted concurrently with the flight demonstration and will be executed in Boston, MA from 7-18 January. The pitch will provide additional details about the proposed solution including refined cost and schedule with the understanding that this information does not constitute a binding proposal. The flight demonstration will focus on baseline platform capability and affords the company with the opportunity to fly the platform and demonstrate overall performance. The system will not be required to meet all P-Spec requirements at this time. For example, it is understood that a thermal camera may not be integrated into the platform at the time of this initial flight demonstration. The intent is to provide the evaluation team with an understanding of the current maturity of the proposed solution. NOTICE: The Government will not provide funding for company participation in the flight demonstration. This will be performed at the company's expense. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Arial"><span>&bull;</span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&bull; Phase III Proposal- This phase will be executed in accordance with the DIU CSO process. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Schedule: </span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Immediately upon award, awardees will begin integration required to transition the baseline commercial system to meet the PSPEC. A series of User Assessments will occur throughout the program to provide feedback on design as well serve as evaluation criteria. User assessment 1 will occur early in the schedule and utilize Alpha prototypes to allow the warfighter to operate the systems and provide initial feedback as a knowledge point for both the companies and the Government. The Alpha prototype in User Assessment 1 will not be required to meet the P-Spec requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Development time will then be provided to allow for integration of critical components (e.g. universal ground controller, radio, thermal camera, etc). This development cycle will be overlapped with a series of user assessments to demonstrate maturity of system integration and provide user feedback critical to the </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">design process. The user assessments will continue to increase in complexity of integration and flight testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">User assessments will inform which system(s) will transition into production. Production will be executed under a follow-on contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">If appropriate, the Government may request vendors to create integrated teams to combine solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Submissions accepted from Nov 5th until Nov 18th. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Companies are advised that any Prototype Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) awarded in response to this Area of Interest may result in the award of a follow-on production contract or transaction without the use of competitive procedures. The follow-on production contract or transaction will be available for use by one or more organizations in the Department of Defense and, as a result, the magnitude of the follow-on production contract or agreement could be significantly larger than that of the prototype OTA. As such, any Prototype Other Transaction Agreement will include the following statement relative to the potential for follow-on production: "In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2371b(f), and upon a determination that the prototype project for this transaction has been successfully completed, this competitively awarded prototype OTA may result in the award of a follow-on production contract or transaction without the use of further competitive procedures." </span></em></p>

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br /><br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of <span><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_rev2003.pdf" target="_blank">OMB Circular A-76</a></span> (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a076_a76_incl_tech_correction/ ) competition performance decisions).<br /><br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsman, </span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: .2pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">NASA is providing notice of an opportunity to participate in the Civilian Commercialization Readiness Pilot Program (CCRPP) for NASA's FY 2019 award cycle of its SBIR/STTR program. </span></p>
</div>
<p>The CCRPP was created as part of the SBIR and STTR Reauthorization Act of 2012 (P. L. 112-81, Section 5001) with the purpose of accelerating the transition of SBIR and STTR funded technologies to commercialization. The CCRPP accomplishes this acceleration through a combination of additional SBIR/STTR program investment and NASA or non-NASA entity sponsor investment.</p>
<p>NASA's CCRPP is available to small business concerns that:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.	Have a completed SBIR/STTR Phase II award from NASA selected from solicitations issued from fiscal year 2010 through 2014. However, NASA will not require completed performance of NASA SBIR/STTR Phase II awards from the 2014 solicitation, and NASA will not require completed performance of Phase II-E or Phase II-X options associated with a NASA SBIR/STTR Phase II award;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.	Have not yet received a CCRPP award (or its equivalent) or a sequential Phase II award from NASA for the Phase II technology associated with the Phase II award in item 1;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.	Have secured an investor(s) willing to contribute matching funding to the maturation of the technology detailed in the application of research related to NASA interests. Investor(s) must be external to the NASA SBIR/STTR Program, which may include such entities as another company, a venture capital firm, an individual investor, a non-SBIR/non-STTR government program, or any combination of the above. An external investor cannot include the owners of the small business, their family members, and/or "affiliates" of the small business, as defined in Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), Section 121.103.</p>
<p>To be eligible, applicants must demonstrate maturation of the Phase II technology that aligns with NASA interests. The technology proposed for advancement toward commercialization should have a strong relevance to NASA's missions as well as a strong potential use by NASA and/or markets outside of NASA beyond the CCRPP investment.</p>
<p>Eligible small business firms may submit a CCRPP application for the 2019 award cycle in response to this notice. NASA will match the investments with SBIR/STTR program funds between $500,000 and $1 Million for each CCRPP award. Eligible firms must identify and obtain commitment from an investor to provide matching funds prior to submission of the CCRPP application.<br />Applications must be submitted via the NASA SBIR/STTR Proposal Submission Electronic Handbook (EHB).</p>
<p>The EHB will accept CCRPP applications between November 5, 2018 and December 14, 2018. NASA will select those applications which are most meritorious and within the budget parameters stated above.</p>

Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to submit offerors to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC Crane. The POC is Ms. Rebekah Bays, Code 0243, Tel:812-854-8836, or email rebekah.bays@navy.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY<br /><br />Summary:<br />The Small Business Administration (SBA) is looking to complete customer journey maps for its federal contracting assistance programs. These programs include the following:<br />&bull; The 8(a) Business Development Program<br />&bull; The HUBZone Program<br />&bull; The Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contracting Program<br />&bull; The Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Program<br />&bull; The All Small Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program<br />The customer journey map exercise will help SBA understand and improve the customer experience for both internal (employee) and external (public) customers and see how customers move through its Government Contracting and Business Development (GCBD) funnel. The map should tell a story by giving an overview of the entire customer experience-- from pre-application, initial contact, obtaining their respective certification(s) and federal contract(s), to receiving contract performance feedback from the federal government to become a better contractor. To learn more about customer journey maps, please visit this website.<br />The SBA intends to put the user front and center in the organization's thinking. This will allow the customer journey map to help identify gaps and points in the customer experience that are disjointed or painful. The end results will then be used as a road map for improvement which may take the form of new processes, training tools, better communication and marketing, and enhanced IT systems. <br />To that end, SBA is seeking help on the following questions so that the agency can complete the customer journey mapping exercise: <br />Customer Personas: Before conducting each customer journey map, the SBA will segment its different audiences within the Government Contracting and Business Development portfolio. To achieve this goal, SBA needs more information to create customer personas for the different customer journeys.<br />1. Who are the different customer personas that utilize the different SBA government programs?<br />a. What are the demographics of these different personas?<br />b. What are the motivators, goals, and needs of the different personas?<br />c. What does success look like for these different personas?<br />d. What challenges do these personas face?<br />e. Where do these personas typically receive their information? <br />f. What are the persona's preferences in terms of receiving communication? <br />g. How have these personas worked with the government before?<br />Research Plan: The SBA plans on interviewing its stakeholders to gather a clear picture of their experience throughout the life cycle of interacting with the Government Contracting and Business Development program(s). The SBA is requesting information on its research plan and what types of open-ended questions it should be asking its customers through the interview process.<br />2. Should the SBA be breaking its research efforts into stages and different sprints?<br />a. How many research phases should the SBA deploy to gain a clear picture on the customer journey?<br />3. What types of open ended questions should the SBA be asking its external (public) customers?<br />4. What types of open ended questions should the SBA be asking its internal (employee) customers?<br />5. How can the SBA validate the customer through the interview process?<br />Customer Journey Mapping<br />6. Should the SBA be conducting any pre-work before embarking on this customer journey mapping exercise?<br />7. How should SBA go about the customer journey mapping exercise?<br />8. How should SBA internally communicate the goals of the customer journey map and the synthesis of research to keep everyone informed? <br />a. What are some internal communication best practices that SBA can utilize? <br />9. What are some other customer journey mapping best practices SBA should be aware of?<br />Process Improvement<br />10. How can the SBA use the customer journey map for process improvement? <br />b. What are some process improvement best practices that the SBA can utilize? <br />11. After completing the customer journey mapping exercise, how can the SBA evaluate which pain points and recommendations to focus in on?<br />12. How can SBA optimize use of the journey maps to improve outcomes?<br />Post-Journey Map Exercise<br />13. What are best practices for handling the information we collected during the journey mapping exercise?<br />14. Is there an official process for closing the journey map exercise?<br />

<CONTACT>Shadie Teymourian, Contract Specialist, Email steymourian@doc.gov
<DESC>Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2, the Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), intends to issue a sole source GSA task order to the Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI). ESRI is the sole provider for the ESRI Managed Cloud Service, a product which incorporates a unique combination of its ArcGIS Online product, hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, with the professional services necessary to adapt the solution to the specific needs of NTIA and its broadband availability mapping program.
<p>Importantly, the legislation requires that NTIA produce a working map no later than September 30, 2019. In order to meet the Congressional directive while complying with NTIA and Federal procedures, the vendor must be able to achieve an Authority to Operate (ATO) in an expedited time-frame. Within DOC, it generally takes more than six months to secure an ATO new cloud-based solutions - a timeframe which would seriously jeopardize NTIA's program. However, it is possible to secure an ATO more quickly by procuring a solution that has previously met DOC and GSA standards for cloud-based solutions.  In that case, appropriate authorizing documentation was previously completed by another agency. Leveraging that documentation, NTIA can accelerate the adoption of its secure cloud solution.<br />GSA's Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This approach uses a "do once, use many times" framework that saves cost, time, and staff required to conduct redundant Agency security assessments.  ESRI Managed Cloud Services for AWS was FedRamp authorized by a DOC bureau, Census. Census recently utilized a Brand Name Justification and selected ESRI to build the Census Business Builder (CBB) application, a cloud-based tool that visualizes and analyzes demographic and economic data via ESRI Managed Cloud Services. The fact that a fellow DOC agency successfully sponsored the FedRamp and achieved ATO for the CBB leads to a high degree of confidence that ESRI Managed Cloud Services will also meet NTIA and DOC requirements for an expedited ATO.</p>
<p>The intent of this notice is not to request competitive quotations and no solicitation is available or will be issued. Any information received from interested parties will only be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement should be conducted. Interested parties may submit a description of their firms' capabilities for satisfying the requirement, which demonstrates they possess the ability to successfully perform this effort. All questions concerning this matter should be addressed directly to Shadie Teymourian at steymourian@doc.gov by 5pm EST on Friday, November 9, 2018.</p>

<DESC>The USACE, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Contracting Office intends to issue a sole source award to Geokon, 48 Spencer Street, Lebanon, NH 03766, for the purchase of 32 ice gages with 20 feet of CAB-541 TPR cable attached to each. Each should be 2 gage cable. Also needed is TPR cable for Ice Gage, 6-pair, 20 gage. These items are needed to monitor stress state within sea ice with the goal of enhancing operational predictions of ice breakup. The sensors are a key component of an experiment monitoring ice stress state in real time. The Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) designed the biaxial ice stress meter in conjunction with Geokon decades ago specifically for use in sea ice. The 4350 series of ice stress meters is only produced by Geokon. This procurement action is exercised as sole source under statutory authority set forth under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). This Notice of Intent is for information purposes only. The Government intends to procure from only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures. There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing, with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees. This notice of intent is for information purposes only. All sources eligible to provide this requirement must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide the supply as outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received within 4 calendar days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining this product through a sole source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Interested parties may submit their capabilities statement for consideration by the Government to Robyn.D.Wells@usace.army.mil.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract.

The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

The Department of State's mission is to advance U.S. national security interests, fight terrorism, protect U.S. interests abroad, and implement foreign policy initiatives that build a freer, prosperous and secure world.</p>
<p>Mission of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL): INL is under the Under Secretary for Democracy and Human Rights (J) and works to keep Americans safe at home by countering international crime, illegal drugs, and instability abroad.

<p>The INL Section in the Embassy in Lima manages an illicit crop eradication and law enforcement assistance program in Peru, funded through the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account.</p>
<p>INCLE-funded assistance complements the Peruvian government's counter narcotics activities designed to deter, detect, and disrupt transnational organized crime groups in Peru and throughout the region.  It also complements the Peruvian government's even larger investment in promoting rule of law; providing for citizen security; and reforming state institutions to foster greater transparency, responsiveness, and respect for human rights.  The goal of this program is to improve and institutionalize Peruvian counter narcotics and law enforcement capabilities through targeted, sustainable projects.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>1. Solicitation. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The CA Army National Guard intends to utilize this Request for Quote (RFQ), under solicitation number W912LA-19-T-0010, to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract for the supplies to support the California Army National Guard Yellow Ribbon Program. The Government intends to award one contract to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government. <br />This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-101, Defense Acquisition Circular DPN 20180928, and Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Revision #27.<br />See the attached CLIN Structure Price Sheet (Attachment 1) in accordance with FAR 12.603(c)(v).<br />This solicitation is 100% set aside for small business. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 721110. The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $32.5 millions of dollars.<br />Each offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, apply to this solicitation and are listed in Attachment 2. Attachment 2 identifies the applicable clauses and provisions to this RFQ. All clauses and provisions may be found in full text at the following site: http://farsite.hill.af.mil.<br />2. Description of Requirement. The Government has a need to acquire conference space and amenities (i.e. breakfast, lunch, water) for informational meetings. This requirement is for temporary use on a non-recurring basis. The need is for no less than five (5) rooms total for five hundred fifty (550) attendees: One (1) general concession room to accommodate five hundred (500) attendees, comprised of single and family units; three (3) breakout rooms that can accommodate one hundred twenty five (125) attendees each and comprised of "classroom" style seating; one (1) general use room (air walled into two (2) sections if possible) to accommodate fifty (50) children and appropriate staff; one (1) small meeting space that can accommodate five (5) people in Sacramento, CA 92806 (10 mile radius) on 17 &amp; 18 November, 2018. <br />3. Basis for Award. The Government intends to award without discussions one FFP contract for the acquisition of event space. Award will be made to the lowest price responsible offeror that is determined to be technically acceptable. The Government intends to select one contractor; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all. <br />Since award will be based on initial responses, offerors are highly encouraged to quote their most advantageous pricing in their initial response. The responses to this RFQ are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions unless discussions are deemed to be necessary. <br />4. Best Value Evaluation. For this procurement, the Best Value determination will be made as Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: A) Price, B) Technical, and C) Past Performance Factors.<br />A. Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the price sheet by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). The TEP is a two-part computation. First, the offeror's total proposed price will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Price Proposal Worksheet by the unit price, limited to two decimal places, for each SLIN to confirm the extended total amount for each CLIN; the sum of all extended amounts will be the offeror's total proposed price. Second, the total proposed price will constitute the TEP.<br />B. Technical and past performance factors will be evaluated by the ratings listed below. The failure of an offeror to meet the requirements of a factor or sub-factor will result in an unacceptable le rating. The technical, past performance, and subcontracting plan factors will receive one of the ratings listed below:<br />(1) Acceptable: Quote clearly meets the requirements of the solicitation.<br />(2) Unacceptable: Quote does not clearly meet the requirements of the solicitation.<br />C. Technical and Past Performance Factors: The Government will evaluate the offers for being technically acceptable and for being rated acceptable or unacceptable for past performance, assigning the ratings as described in the paragraph above. The failure of an offer to meet any or all of the technical criteria will result in a technically unacceptable rating and preclude award. A rating of unacceptable for one or more technical sub-factors will constitute an overall rating of unacceptable for the technical evaluation.<br />Factor 1 - Technical. The Government will determine acceptability based on Contractor ability to provide adequate location and amenity requirements.<br />Factor 2 - Past Performance. The Government will determine acceptability based on either Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) ratings, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) or from other sources (if necessary). Past performance is determined by work completed within the past three (3) years. Relevancy is based on providing event space support. If an offeror has no recent or relevant past performance, past performance will be treated as neutral, resulting in an acceptable rating. <br />5. Additional Instructions to Offerors. Vendors shall respond to this RFQ via email by November 12, 2018 by 11:00 A.M. Pacific Standard Time (PST). All quotes should be sent to the Contract Specialist, Stella Davis at stella.h.davis.civ@mail.mil before the due date and time specified.

<p>7.	1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018) <br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. (a) Definitions. Contractor Employees - The term "contractor em Attachment 1 AA 18-06 (b) Requirements. 1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. 2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. 3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). 4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable. Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance. i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace 2 Attachment 1 AA 18-06 Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed. ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106. 5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. (c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline. For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including: &#9679; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 &#9679; Website &amp; Online Chat: https://NOAASASHHelpline.org &#9679; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) &#9679; Text: (202) 335-0265 (d) Confidentiality. Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties. 3 Attachment 1 AA 18-06 (e) Remedies. In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in: 1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; 2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; 3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; 4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; 5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action.</p>
<p>8.	NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />A.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />(1)	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />(2)	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.<br />(3)	Identify constraints in transparency and process. <br />B.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />C.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />D.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&shy;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.<br />7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).<br />E.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.<br />F.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.<br />G.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24-hour, 365-day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property.</p>
<p>In a "normal" year the Norman Upper Air Observation Site (KOUN) located at the Oklahoma City/Norman Weather Forecast Office (WFO) performs upwards of 760 upper air soundings per year: 730 synoptic upper air flights (occurring routinely twice a day at 00Z (midnight Zulu time) and 12Z (noon Zulu time), 365 days a year), 20 special flights (performed by request in direct support of significant weather events), and up to 10 second-releases for synoptic flights on an as needed basis.</p>
<p>Each balloon requires approximately 80 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Less than 10% of the flights requiring additional helium for environmental factors. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS WFO Norman is to receive and keep on-site an adequate supply of helium gas (no less than 2,000 CF or a quantity of 10, HE 200 cylinders, up to 3,800 CF or a quantity of 19, HE 200 cylinders) in individual size 200 cylinders to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying helium to the NWS WFO Norman upper air building located at 120 David L. Boren Blvd., Norman, OK 73072. The total amount of helium to be delivered for the 12 month period of this requirement will be a minimum of 61,000 CF (qty: 305, HE 200 cylinders), up to a maximum of 75,000 CF (qty: 375, HE 200 cylinders). The helium will be supplied at regular intervals throughout the period, provided as individual cylinders, delivered approximately every two weeks. See Delivery Schedule in Requirements Section, below, for details.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS WFO Norman Office co-located at the National Weather Center, 120 David L. Boren Blvd., Norman, OK 73072. The physical point of delivery is at the Upper Air Building located on the southeast side of the property, near the NWC Dock entrance (facility location indicated with red arrow in picture below). The delivery truck driver must call ahead to the forecast office at (405)325-3816 to coordinate pick-up/drop-off. <br />Aerial View of the National Weather Center - 120 David L. Boren Boulevard, Norman, OK 73072</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All helium must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to nineteen (19) size 200 cylinders of helium at a time. This site uses a minimum of 160 CF of helium every day of the year. Actual use will vary with potential "Special" soundings in support of severe weather. We anticipate using approximately 2,240 CF of helium every two (2) weeks, but need to keep an additional store of helium on-site in case of unforeseen launches. The intent is that we will be replenished to our maximum of approximately 3,800 CF (qty: 19, HE 200 cylinders) after each completed delivery.</p>
<p>Initial Delivery &amp; Recurring Deliveries: The Contractor shall supply a minimum of 2,000 CF (qty: 10, size HE 200 <br />cylinders) of industrial helium on January 1, 2019. The Contractor shall continue to supply helium gas to the Place <br />of Performance in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule. The Contractor will replenish back to <br />3,800 CF (qty: 19, HE 200 cylinders) of industrial helium every other week in accordance with the arranged schedule, <br />replacing all empty helium cylinders with full helium cylinders in the same trip. If additional deliveries are required <br />prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, <br />with delivery to be completed within three business days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. The loading area is located on the east side of the inflation building. The loading area will remain clear of obstructions and all safety rules shall be followed. Cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point. All equipment necessary for loading and unloading the helium shall be provided by the Contractor and all heavy lifting and physical labor will be conducted by the Contractor. NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion with cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries will be made every other week, Monday through Friday between the hours of 0800 <br />and 1700 local time to the Place of Performance. This is a strict time slot as the balloon launches must not be delayed <br />or interrupted in order to receive the delivery. Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, including <br />weekends and holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a <br />regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The <br />Contractor will contact the NWS Norman Forecast Office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason.</p>
<p>The delivery schedule shall be arranged with the Upper Air Program point of contact, Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC), or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see section 8 below for office contact information).</p>
<p><br />Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to a vendor other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact (listed in section 8 below) shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former Contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to another vendor other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts to mitigate any disruption in the continuity of operations. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice. The associated invoice(s) shall be provided or made accessible to an assigned NWS WFO Norman representative either online, via email, or physically mailed paper copy.</p>
<p><br />Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e.: a delivery results in less than full replenishment of helium), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e.: without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p><br />SAFETY AND SECURITY:<br />All rules concerning safety, not smoking, and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at NWS Norman WFO, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to record keeping will be strictly followed, with a copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>INVOICING:<br />The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's helium deliveries and related surcharges (e.g.: cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the Contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.270-304 ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted "to be determined as needed" hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>MIAMI WFO (WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE) FLORIDA, UPPER AIR</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Miami, FL launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 0600 and 1800 Eastern Time. Each balloon requires approximately 75 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-site an adequate supply of hydrogen gas (no less than 1,970 CF, up to 5,319 CF) in individual cylinders to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen to the NWS upper air building located at 11691 SW 17th Street, Miami, FL 33165. The total amount of hydrogen to be delivered for the 12 month period of this requirement will be a minimum of 54,000 CF, up to a maximum of 70,000 CF. The hydrogen will be supplied at regular intervals throughout the period, provided as individual cylinders, delivered approximately every two weeks. See Delivery Schedule in Requirements Section, below, for details.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at 11691 SW 17th Street, Miami, FL 33165. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation building, located on the North side of the main building. The hydrogen truck is permitted to use the second driveway to the left past the main driveway for delivery; drop off door is located on the East side of the inflation building (red arrow on below picture of the facilities).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All hydrogen must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow <br />for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 27 cylinders of <br />hydrogen at a time. This site uses a minimum of 160 CF of hydrogen, every day of the year. Actual use has the potential <br />to vary if we have to launch extra balloons. We anticipate using 1,150 CF every week, but need to keep an additional <br />store of hydrogen on site in case of additional unforeseen launches. The intent is that we will be replenished to our <br />minimum of approximately 4,334 CF after each completed delivery.</p>
<p><br />Initial Delivery: The contractor shall supply a minimum of 54,334CF of hydrogen on January 1st, 2019. The actual <br />amount of supplied will vary based on the size of the cylinders. The hydrogen will be contained in no more than 27,197 <br />CF capacity individual cylinders.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries shall be made every week, Monday through Friday between the hours of 0800 and 1700 <br />local time. This is a strict time slot as the balloon launches must not be delayed or interrupted in order to receive the <br />delivery. Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery <br />schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor <br />is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an <br />alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other <br />reason. If the Contractor is unable to find a reasonable supply in time to fill the requirement, the NWS reserves the right <br />to purchase hydrogen from another supplier outside of this contract.</p>
<p>If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor <br />and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three calendar days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The delivery schedule shall be arranged with the Upper Air Program Point-of Contact, Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC), <br />or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see Points of Contact, POC).</p>
<p><br />Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the <br />contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact, listed in section 9 below, shall establish the <br />delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former <br />contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current <br />Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a <br />missed balloon launch due to the hydrogen being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period <br />may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Recurring Deliveries: The point of delivery is not staffed except for during the balloon launches. The Contractor shall <br />supply hydrogen gas to the Place of Performance in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule.</p>
<p>The Contractor will replenish back to 4,334 CF of hydrogen on a week basis in accordance with the arranged schedule, <br />replacing all empty hydrogen cylinders with full hydrogen cylinders. The Contractor shall pick up the empty cylinders in <br />the same trip. If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact <br />the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three business days of being <br />contacted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. The loading area is located on <br />the East side of the inflation building. The loading area will remain clear of obstructions and all safety rules shall be <br />followed. Cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point. All equipment necessary for loading and <br />unloading the hydrogen shall be provided by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and <br />clean fashion with cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that <br />there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises. <br />NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative <br />at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be <br />attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full <br />replenishment of hydrogen to 4,334 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the <br />delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery <br />charges).</p>
<p>SAFETY AND SECURITY:<br />All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the <br />information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications <br />Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as <br />necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>INVOICING:</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />&#9633; (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror &#9633; does &#9633; does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />&#9633; (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.270-304 ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted "to be determined as needed" hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue solicitation N00024-18-R-4448 for the execution of the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51), USS BULKELEY (DDG 84), and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44), hereinafter referred to collectively as "these CNO Availabilities", are planned for fiscal year 2019 (FY19). Each of these CNO Availabilities is scheduled to start in January 2019. Upon completion of these CNO Availabilities, each ship shall be capable of carrying out its respective mission with a reasonable expectation of maintaining a satisfactory condition of readiness until the next CNO-scheduled depot availability.</p>
<p>These CNO Availabilities will be solicited, competed, and awarded as private sector availabilities, using the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). The anticipated contracts, like all other CNO-scheduled depot availabilities, are considered supply contracts. The supply being procured is the repaired, mission-ready vessel, which is returned to service with the Fleet.</p>
<p>USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51) dry-docking selected restricted availability (DSRA) production period will be approximately 8 months, beginning in January 2019 and completing in August 2019.<br /><br />USS BULKELEY (DDG 84) depot modernization period (DMP) production period will be approximately 15 months, beginning in January 2019 and completing in April 2020.</p>
<p>USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44) dry-docking selected restricted availability (DSRA) production period will be approximately 13 months, beginning in January 2019 and completing in February 2020.</p>
<p>The scope of the procurement includes all labor, supervision, facilities, equipment, production, testing and quality assurance necessary to prepare for and accomplish these CNO Availabilities. These CNO Availabilities are expected to require a highly capable contractor, or contractors, with substantial facilities, including dry-dock(s), pier(s) and human resources capable of completing, coordinating and integrating multiple areas of ship maintenance, repair and modernization of the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51), USS BULKELEY (DDG 84), and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44).</p>
<p>The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) requires that full and open competition be used to the maximum extent practicable. 10 USC 7299a allows for the limitation of competition for "short term" availabilities (10 months or less) to the homeport, provided there is adequate competition. As the production periods for two of these CNO Availabilities are greater than 10 months, the USS BULKELEY (DDG 84) FY19 DMP and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44) FY19 DSRA will be competed on a coast-wide basis, without limiting the place of performance to the vessel's homeport. As the production period for one of these CNO Availabilities is less than 10 months, the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51) FY19 DSRA will be competed only within the Norfolk VA homeport area.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued electronically via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at http://fbo.gov and interested parties must comply with that announcement. Interested offerors should monitor the FBO page for the release of the solicitation, and any applicable amendments. Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to participate in this procurement at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. FBO is the single point of entry for posting of the synopsis and solicitations to the internet. This pre-solicitation notice is for information only and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award of contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or around 27 July 2018.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates making a single award on or around 20 November 2018.</p>
<p>For Additional Attachments S-5, J-1, J-2, J-3, J-4, J-5, J-7, J-8, J-9, J-10, J-11, J-12, J-14, J-15, J-16, J-17, J-18, J-19, and J-21 please contact <a href="mailto:randolph.cook@navy.mil">randolph.cook@navy.mil</a> and <a href="mailto:jamillah.powell@navy.mil">jamillah.powell@navy.mil</a></p>

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:

(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or
(2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.

AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.

Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

(5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.
(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

(i) Establishment of new rules and programs or re-evaluation of existing programs to prohibit text messaging while driving; and

(ii) Education, awareness, and other outreach to employees about the safety risks associated with texting while driving.

(d) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts that exceed the micro-purchase threshold.<BR><BR>(a) Method of payment.
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term EFT refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the SAM database.
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractors EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractors EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.<BR><BR>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractors EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractors financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the SAM database.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 32.706-3, insert the following clause:

(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 33.106, insert the following provision:

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.
(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms contract, contractor, and Contracting Officer shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.5071, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>TALLAHASSEE WFO (WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE)<br />BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Tallahassee, FL launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 0600 and 1800 Eastern Standard Time. Each balloon requires approximately 101 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-site an adequate supply of helium gas (no less than 900 CF, up to 5,400 CF) in individual cylinders to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying helium to the NWS Weather Forecast Office at 1017 Academic Way, Tallahassee, FL 32306-4509. The total amount of helium to be delivered for the 12 month period of this requirement will be a minimum of 70,000 CF, up to a maximum of 90,000 CF. The helium will be supplied at regular intervals throughout the period, provided as individual cylinders, delivered approximately every two weeks. See Delivery Schedule in Section 6, below, for details.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at 1017 Academic Way, Tallahassee, FL 32306-4509. The point of delivery is at the basement loading dock, located through the gate past the main entrance. The helium truck is permitted to use the main parking lot for delivery on Tuesday and Thursday; The Loading dock is located on the South side of the building (red arrow on below picture of the facilities). Access to the loading dock is limited by gate that will slide open providing an 8 ft width of access. The door to the basement entrance will open to a width of roughly 6 ft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All helium must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for<br />other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 18 cylinders of helium at <br />a time. This site uses a minimum of 202 CF of helium, every day of the year. Actual use has the potential to vary if we<br />have to launch extra balloons. We anticipate using 2,828 CF every two weeks. The intent is that we will be replenished <br />to our maximum of approximately 5,256 CF after each completed delivery.</p>
<p>Initial Delivery: The contractor shall supply a minimum of 5,256 CF of helium on January 1st, 2019. The actual amount <br />of supplied will vary based on the size of the cylinders. The helium will be contained in no more than 18, 300 CF <br />capacity individual cylinders.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries shall be made every two weeks, Tuesday or Thursday between the hours of 0800 and <br />1800 local time. This is a strict time slot as the balloon launches must not be delayed or interrupted in order to receive <br />the delivery. Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery <br />schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor <br />is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an <br />alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other <br />reason. If the Contractor is unable to find a reasonable supply in time to fill the requirement, the NWS reserves the right <br />to purchase helium from another supplier outside of this contract.</p>
<p>If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor <br />and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three calendar days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The delivery schedule shall be arranged with the Upper Air Program Point-of Contact, Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC), <br />or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see section 8 below for contact information).</p>
<p>Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the <br />contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact, listed in section 9 below, shall establish the <br />delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former <br />contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current <br />Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a <br />missed balloon launch due to the helium being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may <br />include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Recurring Deliveries: The point of delivery is not staffed except for during the balloon launches. The Contractor shall <br />supply helium gas to the Place of Performance in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule.</p>
<p>The Contractor will replenish back to 18 tanks of helium on a two week basis in accordance with the arranged schedule, <br />replacing all empty helium cylinders with full helium cylinders. The Contractor shall pick up the empty cylinders in the <br />same trip. If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the <br />Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three business days of being <br />contacted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. The loading area is located on <br />the South side of the building. The loading area will remain clear of obstructions and all safety rules shall be followed. <br />Cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point. All equipment necessary for loading and unloading the <br />helium shall be provided by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and <br />clean fashion with cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that <br />there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises. <br />NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative <br />at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be <br />attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full <br />replenishment of helium to 5,256 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery <br />into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>SAFETY AND SECURITY:<br />All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the <br />information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications <br />Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as <br />necessary and upon request.</p>
<p><br />INVOICING:</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's helium deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. <br />cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />e.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.270-304 ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted "to be determined as needed" hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018)</p>
<p>In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. (a) Definitions. Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: &bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; &bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; &bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures. A (b) Requirements. 1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. 2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. 3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). 4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable. Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance. i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace</p>
<p>a. Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed. ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106. 5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. (c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline. For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including: &#9679; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 &#9679; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org &#9679; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) &#9679; Text: (202) 335-0265 (d) Confidentiality. Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.</p>
<p>b. (e) Remedies. In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in: 1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; 2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; 3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; 4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; 5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action.</p>
<p>(End of contract language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-71 GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS-NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>(End of Contract Language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted ________ hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.<br />(End of Contract Language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-70, CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATIONS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.<br />(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.<br />(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.</p>

<p>NORMAN OKLAHOMA CITY WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE (WFO)</p>
<p>PURCHASE AND PICKUP/DELIVERY HELIUM GAS SUPPLY, <br />HAZMAT FEE AND CYLINDER RENTAL FEE TO THE</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24-hour, 365-day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property.</p>
<p>In a "normal" year the Norman Upper Air Observation Site (KOUN) located at the Oklahoma City/Norman Weather Forecast Office (WFO) performs upwards of 760 upper air soundings per year: 730 synoptic upper air flights (occurring routinely twice a day at 00Z (midnight Zulu time) and 12Z (noon Zulu time), 365 days a year), 20 special flights (performed by request in direct support of significant weather events), and up to 10 second-releases for synoptic flights on an as needed basis.</p>
<p>Each balloon requires approximately 80 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Less than 10% of the flights requiring additional helium for environmental factors. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS WFO Norman is to receive and keep on-site an adequate supply of helium gas (no less than 2,000 CF or a quantity of 10, HE 200 cylinders, up to 3,800 CF or a quantity of 19, HE 200 cylinders) in individual size 200 cylinders to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying helium to the NWS WFO Norman upper air building located at 120 David L. Boren Blvd., Norman, OK 73072. The total amount of helium to be delivered for the 12 month period of this requirement will be a minimum of 61,000 CF (qty: 305, HE 200 cylinders), up to a maximum of 75,000 CF (qty: 375, HE 200 cylinders). The helium will be supplied at regular intervals throughout the period, provided as individual cylinders, delivered approximately every two weeks. See Delivery Schedule in Requirements Section, below, for details.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS WFO Norman Office co-located at the National Weather Center, 120 David L. Boren Blvd., Norman, OK 73072. The physical point of delivery is at the Upper Air Building located on the southeast side of the property, near the NWC Dock entrance (facility location indicated with red arrow in picture below). The delivery truck driver must call ahead to the forecast office at (405)325-3816 to coordinate pick-up/drop-off. <br />Aerial View of the National Weather Center - 120 David L. Boren Boulevard, Norman, OK 73072</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All helium must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to nineteen (19) size 200 cylinders of helium at a time. This site uses a minimum of 160 CF of helium every day of the year. Actual use will vary with potential "Special" soundings in support of severe weather. We anticipate using approximately 2,240 CF of helium every two (2) weeks, but need to keep an additional store of helium on-site in case of unforeseen launches. The intent is that we will be replenished to our maximum of approximately 3,800 CF (qty: 19, HE 200 cylinders) after each completed delivery.</p>
<p>Initial Delivery &amp; Recurring Deliveries: The Contractor shall supply a minimum of 2,000 CF (qty: 10, size HE 200 <br />cylinders) of industrial helium on January 1, 2019. The Contractor shall continue to supply helium gas to the Place <br />of Performance in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule. The Contractor will replenish back to <br />3,800 CF (qty: 19, HE 200 cylinders) of industrial helium every other week in accordance with the arranged schedule, <br />replacing all empty helium cylinders with full helium cylinders in the same trip. If additional deliveries are required <br />prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, <br />with delivery to be completed within three business days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. The loading area is located on the east side of the inflation building. The loading area will remain clear of obstructions and all safety rules shall be followed. Cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point. All equipment necessary for loading and unloading the helium shall be provided by the Contractor and all heavy lifting and physical labor will be conducted by the Contractor. NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion with cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries will be made every other week, Monday through Friday between the hours of 0800 <br />and 1700 local time to the Place of Performance. This is a strict time slot as the balloon launches must not be delayed <br />or interrupted in order to receive the delivery. Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, including <br />weekends and holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a <br />regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The <br />Contractor will contact the NWS Norman Forecast Office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason.</p>
<p>The delivery schedule shall be arranged with the Upper Air Program point of contact, Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC), or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see section 8 below for office contact information).</p>
<p><br />Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to a vendor other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact (listed in section 8 below) shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former Contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to another vendor other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts to mitigate any disruption in the continuity of operations. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice. The associated invoice(s) shall be provided or made accessible to an assigned NWS WFO Norman representative either online, via email, or physically mailed paper copy.</p>
<p><br />Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e.: a delivery results in less than full replenishment of helium), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e.: without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p><br />SAFETY AND SECURITY:<br />All rules concerning safety, not smoking, and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at NWS Norman WFO, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to record keeping will be strictly followed, with a copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>INVOICING:<br />The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's helium deliveries and related surcharges (e.g.: cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the Contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.270-304 ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted "to be determined as needed" hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue solicitation N00024-18-R-4448 for the execution of the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51), USS BULKELEY (DDG 84), and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44), hereinafter referred to collectively as "these CNO Availabilities", are planned for fiscal year 2019 (FY19). Each of these CNO Availabilities is scheduled to start in January 2019. Upon completion of these CNO Availabilities, each ship shall be capable of carrying out its respective mission with a reasonable expectation of maintaining a satisfactory condition of readiness until the next CNO-scheduled depot availability.</p>
<p>These CNO Availabilities will be solicited, competed, and awarded as private sector availabilities, using the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). The anticipated contracts, like all other CNO-scheduled depot availabilities, are considered supply contracts. The supply being procured is the repaired, mission-ready vessel, which is returned to service with the Fleet.</p>
<p>USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51) dry-docking selected restricted availability (DSRA) production period will be approximately 8 months, beginning in January 2019 and completing in August 2019.<br /><br />USS BULKELEY (DDG 84) depot modernization period (DMP) production period will be approximately 15 months, beginning in January 2019 and completing in April 2020.</p>
<p>USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44) dry-docking selected restricted availability (DSRA) production period will be approximately 13 months, beginning in January 2019 and completing in February 2020.</p>
<p>The scope of the procurement includes all labor, supervision, facilities, equipment, production, testing and quality assurance necessary to prepare for and accomplish these CNO Availabilities. These CNO Availabilities are expected to require a highly capable contractor, or contractors, with substantial facilities, including dry-dock(s), pier(s) and human resources capable of completing, coordinating and integrating multiple areas of ship maintenance, repair and modernization of the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51), USS BULKELEY (DDG 84), and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44).</p>
<p>The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) requires that full and open competition be used to the maximum extent practicable. 10 USC 7299a allows for the limitation of competition for "short term" availabilities (10 months or less) to the homeport, provided there is adequate competition. As the production periods for two of these CNO Availabilities are greater than 10 months, the USS BULKELEY (DDG 84) FY19 DMP and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44) FY19 DSRA will be competed on a coast-wide basis, without limiting the place of performance to the vessel's homeport. As the production period for one of these CNO Availabilities is less than 10 months, the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51) FY19 DSRA will be competed only within the Norfolk VA homeport area.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued electronically via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at http://fbo.gov and interested parties must comply with that announcement. Interested offerors should monitor the FBO page for the release of the solicitation, and any applicable amendments. Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to participate in this procurement at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. FBO is the single point of entry for posting of the synopsis and solicitations to the internet. This pre-solicitation notice is for information only and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award of contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or around 27 July 2018.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates making&nbsp;three (3)&nbsp;single awards on or around 20 November 2018.</p>
<p>For Additional Attachments S-5, J-1, J-2, J-3, J-4, J-5, J-7, J-8, J-9, J-10, J-11, J-12, J-14, J-15, J-16, J-17, J-18, J-19, and J-21 please contact <a href="mailto:randolph.cook@navy.mil">randolph.cook@navy.mil</a> and <a href="mailto:jamillah.powell@navy.mil">jamillah.powell@navy.mil</a></p>

<RESPDATE>011419
<CONTACT>Brian T. Burns, Contracting Officer, Phone 6173787565, Email brian.burns@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for Federal buildings nationwide.
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a Federal art commission in conjunction with the construction of the new U.S. Land Port of Entry (LPOE) in Madawaska, Maine.</p>
<p>GSA will design and construct a new LPOE that meets the mission and operational requirements of the Federal inspection agencies.  The design and construction of the new LPOE will be in coordination with the Maine Department of Transportation (MaineDOT) and the New Brunswick (Canada) Department of Transportation and Infrastructure's (NBDTI).  MaineDOT and NBDTI are developing a new Madawaska (Maine) - Edmundston (Canada) International Bridge.</p>
<p>GSA allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs of new or modernized Federal facilities for art commissions.  The art budget for this project is estimated to be $257,688.  One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artists Registry (Registry).  The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions.  Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</p>
<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the new LPOE in Madawaska, Maine, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 3:00 PM Eastern Time on Monday, January 14, 2019.  Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry.  Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: media, materials, content, style and scope of the artist's past work, and artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis.  Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a statement that the artist can perform the work associated with the GSA commission within the identified budget.  GSA will count the combined weight of all the selection criteria as significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the LPOE project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and, the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Arial"><span><span style="FONT: 7pt ">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&bull; Phase II Pitch- This phase will be executed in accordance with the DIU CSO process with the following modifications. The pitch phase will consist of an in-person pitch as well as a flight demonstration. The in-person pitch will be conducted concurrently with the flight demonstration and will be executed in Boston, MA from 7-18 January. The pitch will provide additional details about the proposed solution including refined cost and schedule with the understanding that this information does not constitute a binding proposal. The flight demonstration will focus on baseline platform capability and affords the company with the opportunity to fly the platform and demonstrate overall performance. The system will not be required to meet all P-Spec requirements at this time. For example, it is understood that a thermal camera may not be integrated into the platform at the time of this initial flight demonstration. The intent is to provide the evaluation team with an understanding of the current maturity of the proposed solution. NOTICE: The Government will not provide funding for company participation in the flight demonstration. This will be performed at the company's expense. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Arial"><span>&bull;</span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&bull; Phase III Proposal- This phase will be executed in accordance with the DIU CSO process. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Schedule: </span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Immediately upon award, awardees will begin integration required to transition the baseline commercial system to meet the PSPEC. A series of User Assessments will occur throughout the program to provide feedback on design as well serve as evaluation criteria. User assessment 1 will occur early in the schedule and utilize Alpha prototypes to allow the warfighter to operate the systems and provide initial feedback as a knowledge point for both the companies and the Government. The Alpha prototype in User Assessment 1 will not be required to meet the P-Spec requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Development time will then be provided to allow for integration of critical components (e.g. universal ground controller, radio, thermal camera, etc). This development cycle will be overlapped with a series of user assessments to demonstrate maturity of system integration and provide user feedback critical to the </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">design process. The user assessments will continue to increase in complexity of integration and flight testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">User assessments will inform which system(s) will transition into production. Production will be executed under a follow-on contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">If appropriate, the Government may request vendors to create integrated teams to combine solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Submissions accepted from Nov 5th until Nov 18th. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Companies are advised that any Prototype Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) awarded in response to this Area of Interest may result in the award of a follow-on production contract or transaction without the use of competitive procedures. The follow-on production contract or transaction will be available for use by one or more organizations in the Department of Defense and, as a result, the magnitude of the follow-on production contract or agreement could be significantly larger than that of the prototype OTA. As such, any Prototype Other Transaction Agreement will include the following statement relative to the potential for follow-on production: "In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2371b(f), and upon a determination that the prototype project for this transaction has been successfully completed, this competitively awarded prototype OTA may result in the award of a follow-on production contract or transaction without the use of further competitive procedures." </span></em></p>

<DESC>&nbsp; Dear Valued Suppliers:<br />This is a request for information (RFI). This is not a solicitation for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. This RFI does not constitute a commitment from the Government and any information provided in response to this RFI will be used for informational purposes only. Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked. Vendor participation is not a promise for future business with the Government. The purpose of this RFI is to conduct Market Research.
<p>Background: DLA Troop Support expects to begin issuing solicitations for Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) contracts supporting various regions within the contiguous United States (CONUS). DLA Troop Support's CONUS SPV contractors are responsible for providing full-line food and beverage item distribution support for garrison type feeding to military, federally funded, and other authorized customers in the regions covered by each contract. DLA Troop Support SPV contractors provide food products such as canned items, dry items, chill items, ultra-high temperature (UHT) dairy items, frozen bakery products, frozen meats, frozen seafood and poultry, ice cream, eggs and other dairy products under the contracts. Information on current DLA Troop Support CONUS SPV contracts can be found at: http://www.dla.mil/TroopSupport/Subsistence/Foodservices/Regions/CONUS.aspx</p>
<p>DLA Troop Support's CONUS Subsistence Prime Vendor (CONUS PV) Program is interested in your comments regarding food support for the below customers in the Nebraska and Iowa Area. <br />Current Nebraska and Surrounding Area Customers<br />The estimated contract Period of Performance for the following nine customers is four (4) years and the total estimated dollar value is $4,000,000.00.<br />1. King Dining Facility/Offutt AFB, Offutt AFB, Nebraska<br />2. Campisi Alert Facility, Offutt AFB, Nebraska<br />3. 155th ARW ANG, Lincoln, Nebraska<br />4. Greenlief Training Site Hastings, Nebraska<br />5. 132 Fighter Wing/FSS, Des Moines, Iowa<br />6. 185th Air National Guard, Sioux City, Iowa<br />7. 114th Air National Guard Joe Foss Field, Sioux Falls, SD<br />8. Camp Ashland Nebraska Army National Guard, Ashland Nebraska<br />9. Camp Dodge, Johnston, Iowa</p>
<p>Potential Iowa Customers<br />The following Army National Guard delivery locations are stationed in Iowa and may potentially become customers of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The performance period for the following customers is for four (4) years and the estimated annual dollar value is $1,312,500.00.<br />Seeing that these states are relatively close to each other, from a Prime Vendor perspective:<br />1. Would you recommend supporting both sets of customers under "one region"? Example: "Nebraska and Iowa Region"</p>

<p><br />Discussion: DLA Troop Support may incorporate changes in acquisition strategy in this generation of CONUS SPV solicitations.</p>
<p>1) Use of trade-off source selection procedures, with all evaluation factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award, including their relative importance, clearly stated in the solicitation. <br />2) Use of tiered pricing periods instead of structuring contracts with a base period and option period(s).</p>
<p>For this acquisition DLA Troop Support anticipates reverting back to using the following evaluation technique:</p>
<p>1) Evaluation of weighted distribution prices when evaluating competing proposal prices.</p>
<p>Following are specific questions to consider:<br />1) Can you support any or all of the customers listed above? Many of the customers expect delivery 48 hours after placing their orders. Are there any location limitations in meeting this delivery schedule? <br />2) Do you have preferred delivery set-ups (routes, grouping of customers) to provide complete food support throughout the state?<br />3) Some of our customers are remotely located and require smaller pack-size items. Can this requirement be provided? Can you provide service to them, regardless of weather conditions? What method of shipping would be used?<br />4) Would there be customers who could not be supported if an emergency order is needed (either same day or next day)? <br />We encourage and appreciate your participation; please share your ideas regarding these issues. Your written comments, suggestions and ideas regarding support for our customers will be treated as confidential and for Government use only. Please provide your responses via mail or email, by October 5, 2018 at 3:00 p.m. EST to the following mailing address or email address: Patricia Griffith at Patricia.Griffith@dla.mil or Kevin White at kevin.w.white@dla.mil.<br />DLA Troop Support Philadelphia<br />Directorate of Subsistence/Prime Vendor CONUS<br />ATTN: FTAB/Patricia Griffith/Contracting Officer <br />Patricia.Griffith@dla.mil <br />700 Robbins Ave<br />Philadelphia, PA 19111<br />Primary Point of Contact: <br />Patricia Griffith<br />Contracting Officer<br />Patricia.Griffith@dla.mil <br />Phone: 215-737-2911</p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Sole Source firm-fixed price purchase order to Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (Mesa Labs), at Lakewood Manufacturing Facility, 12100 W 6th Ave, Lakewood, CO 80228, in accordance with the authority under FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). This procurement is being conducted under simplified acquisitions procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The NAICS code is 811219 - Laboratory instrument repair and maintenance services.<br /><br />FDA's Arkansas Laboratory Microbiology Branch has a requirement for the service and maintenance of a Temperature Monitoring System manufactured and supported by Mesa Labs. Temperature is an analytical parameter that influences the outcome of many methods utilized in the regulatory laboratory. As such, it is critical that the laboratory accurately document the performance of numerous instruments in the laboratory with regard to temperature stability. Arkansas Laboratory uses the Mesa Labs (formerly TempSys) CheckPoint &copy; by Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (CheckPoint) automated wireless temperature monitoring system to meet requirements for monitoring analytical critical control points in accordance with its ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation along with AOAC International guidelines and Office of Regulatory Science (ORS) Quality Management System. Each of the temperature probes comes with a unique snap calibration connector that only fits Mesa Labs' wireless transmitters. Because this system is proprietary, all calibration of temperature probes must be performed by CheckPoint personnel. Mesa Labs is the only authorized calibration laboratory certified by the Perry Johnson Laboratory Accreditation, Inc. to provide calibration services for CheckPoint System's probes. A service agreement is required to maintain the system, troubleshoot, and provide calibrated probes annually for this wireless temperature monitoring system. No other vendor can provide this service and maintenance without voiding warranties currently being honored by Mesa Labs. For these reasons, an award to Mesa Labs is intended.
<div><br /></div>
<div>The period of performance will consist of a one (1)-year base year, and four (4) one (1)-year option periods.<br /></div>

<DESC>This notice is a request for information (RFI) and is not a request for proposals (RFP). The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released. In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the Director (OD), Office of Extramural Research (OER), Office of Research Information Systems (ORIS) has a requirement to identify and test an Advanced Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence platform for categorization of scientific projects.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the NIH/OD/OER/ORIS to identify and test a platform that uses advanced natural language processing to read descriptions of scientific projects and categorize the projects as Alzheimer's and/or one of 16 other disease, condition, or research categories. The results of the test will be compared against the current NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization (RCDC) system (https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx; https://report.nih.gov/rcdc/index.aspx), by analyzing the results of the identification and categorization of projects to Alzheimer's and 16 other disease, condition, or research categories. <br /><br />Background:<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Extramural Research (OER), provides the corporate framework for research administration, ensuring scientific integrity, public accountability, and effective stewardship of the NIH extramural research portfolio. OER develops and maintains research portfolio reporting databases and analysis tools on behalf of the NIH, as listed at https://RePORT.nih.gov. These tools are intended to improve NIH-wide internal staff and public access to data on NIH research and management activities to allow staff to evaluate and manage research portfolios as well as to satisfy certain reporting requirements of the NIH Reform Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-482; H.R. 6164, &sect;402B). These tools integrate new and existing data sources to allow user-defined querying, reporting, analysis, evaluation, and visualization of NIH grants, intramural projects, contracts, and associated outputs. An additional purpose is to develop and maintain similar tools to support other offices within NIH and other federal science agencies. <br /><br />Information Requested:</p>
<p>The NIH/OER, Office of Research Information Systems (ORIS), is seeking to identify and test an artificial intelligence platform against the current NIH RCDC system by comparing the results of identification and categorization of 3 years of NIH sponsored projects to categories of Alzheimer's and 16 other disease, condition, or research categories.</p>
<p><br />The NIH/OER/ORIS, is requesting information from offerors that:</p>
<p>a. Propose an easy to use system that employs advanced natural language processing algorithms and artificial intelligence to categorize 3 years of NIH projects to categories of Alzheimer's and 16 other disease, condition, or research categories.</p>
<p>b. The categories to be tested are:<br />1. Alzheimer's Disease<br />2. Frontotemporal Dementia <br />3. Pick's Disease<br />4. Dementia<br />5. Lewy Body Dementia<br />6.

Hodgkin's Disease<br />14. American Indians/Alask Natives<br />15. Breast Cancer<br />16. Ovarian Cancer<br />17. Tyberculosis</p>
<p>c. The platform may be installed locally at NIH or in the cloud but must conform to NIST security requirements for moderately sensitive data.</p>
<p>d. Allows the NIH to actively participate in the test via hands on use of the system including training, category development and validation.</p>
<p>e. Once the test is complete, provide a written report on the project including categorization results and comparisons to existing categorical results (e.g. 1) How the system being tested determines the projects relevant to the category, 2) why the system being tested produces better or worse results, 3) how the tested technology differs from the existing technology, etc.)</p>
<p>f. Once the test is complete, provide a breakdown of the costs for the test and an estimate of the costs needed to license, install and implement your product for NIH categorization in its entirety.</p>
<p>g. Propose an estimated cost for this test and reports over the 6 month period of performance.</p>
<p><br />All responses will be evaluated on their ability to handle each of the following specified requirements for the platform:</p>
<p>1. Utilizes advanced natural language process to "read" the documents (e.g. to identify scientific intent, recognize negation, recognize abbreviations, recognize strings and coordination, etc)<br />2. Uses artificial intelligence to categorize the scientific projects. <br />3. Ease of training of the AI platform (Gold standard sets will be available to train the platform.)<br />4. Previous experience in machine reading and categorization.<br />5.

Provide seats for up to 40 users during testing.<br />8. Provide robust performance and responsiveness.<br />9. Provide an easy to use interface.<br />10. The platform is easily scaled to run at an enterprise level and can handle at least 1000 different categories<br />11. Can return data as a list or as an interactive, customizable graphic.<br />12. Support multiple data export formats (i.e., Excel, PDF, CSV, and Word).<br />13. Provide facilities to access data in an Oracle database in static objects or loaded through dynamic scheduling capabilities.<br />14.

The 65DS boat procurement will be for one (1) additional boat with brand name specific components that are the same as fourteen (14) previous dive support boats owned and maintained by the Government. This boat shall be a contractor design. While multiple sources will be solicited under this competitive small business set aside, the requirement specifies the following Brand Name items:<br /><br />*Cummins (Brand Name) for the diesel engines, quantity&nbsp;two (2);<br />*ZF (Brand Name) for the marine gear, quantity two (2);<br />*Appleton (Brand Name) for the articulating knuckle boom crane, quantity one (1);<br />*Bauer (Brand Name) for the dive compressor, quantity one (1).<br /><br />Detailed rationale for the brand names requested are based upon the following justifications:</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> </span></p>

The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request. There is no solicitation available at this time. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NSWCDD shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or NSWCDD's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>Request for Information:</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren, Virginia 22448-5110, on behalf of NSWCDD DNA, R21 Division, is seeking market research information regarding the following supply products and services:</p>
<p>(1) Maintenance to the customized Non-Commercial Version (NCV) of the gaming engine and capabilities</p>
<p>(2) Integration of additional commercial hardware for the Dangerous Waters Naval System (DWNS)</p>
<p>The NSWCDD Contracts Department is issuing this Sources Sought/RFI announcement for NSWCDD DNA as part of market research efforts to assess availability to provide maintenance to the customized NCV of the gaming engine and capabilities.

Currently, this consists of a laptop (Dell) with high end graphics (Nvidia). This market research effort also seeks to assess the availability of services in support of the German Navy in the areas of technical management, requirements engineering, software development, system test, software support, hardware obsolescence, configuration management, documentation, training, and licensing as it relates to DWNC.</p>
<p>The Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will include a level of effort Firm-Fixed-Price service CLIN 0001 to support the acquisition of engineering and technical services necessary for maintenance, and integration of additional commercial hardware of the DWNC. Engineering and technical support will be procured on individual task/delivery orders.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit their technical capabilities which, if received no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on 19 November 2018, shall be considered by NSWCDD and NSWCDD DNA. All responses must be submitted to the Government points of contact at the email addresses shown below.</p>

<DESC><strong>***FOR SUBCONTRACTOR OPPORTUNITIES ONLY***</strong>
<p>In accordance with the solicitation process identified in Sources Sought Number W91238-18-S-1618, dated 13 April 2018, the following solicitation is posted for subcontractor opportunities only.</p>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This solicitation is proceeding as a 100% Total Small Business Set Aside for those prequalified small business concerns identified on the Prequalified Sources List (PSL) dated 18 May 2018 and revised on 22 June 2018. Only those small business concerns identified on the PSL are eligible to submit a bid for this project.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Reach H Levee Improvement Construction Project:</strong></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div>The Natomas East Main Drainage Canal west levee requires cutoff wall improvements from the pumping station just upstream of Dry Creek downstream (south) to Arden-Garden Connector Bridge. The length of this reach is approximately 4.0 miles. The general improvements include improving the existing levee by fix in-place construction, and installation of a seepage cutoff wall with a depth of approximately 30-70 feet, and flattening the landside levee slope. There are two pump-stations which will require the discharge pipes to be raised. Installation of a landside maintenance road is also required. The cutoff wall construction may be performed by applying either the vertical chain trenching (also known as One Pass Trenching (OPT)) or open trench (conventional long-stick) method.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In accordance with the DFAR 236.204(ii), the magnitude disclosure of this construction project is between $25M and $100M. This proposed contract action will be conducted using FSC Code: Y1LC and NAICS: 237990.</div>
