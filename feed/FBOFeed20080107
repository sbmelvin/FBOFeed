Contractor experience providing similar services within the State of Alaska to  Federal Agencies will be a main consideration along with price, past performance, and technical experience.  Each evaluation factor will be weighted equally for evaluation, however the contracting officer will make a final determination as to the best value of proposals received, and make the final determination as to how many contract awards will be made for this single soliciation.  It is anticipated that any contract award will incorporate the contractors proposed price schedule for services and itemized prices for products and deliverables. The closing date of this solicitation shall be February 22, 2007 at 2:00pm. The applicable NAICS code is 541990 with a size standard of $25M. Firms are invited to submit documentation (any literature, brochures, and references) necessary to support that they possess the required capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements for the following: Description.   Any awarded contract(s) is intended to serve the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), Region 7, Anchorage, Alaska, and the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) Program, as well as any Federal Agency which may require these services within the State of Alaska for the following: 1) Mapping of wetland, riparian, or upland habitats on aerial photography or digital imagery. 2) Digitizing of mapped wetlands, riparian, or upland habitats. 3) Performing technical analyses to include status and trends or area intensification studies. 4) Airborne acquisition or distribution of geographic information in photographic or digital form. Specifications.   The Contractor shall posses expertise in the technical areas of habitat delineation, cartography, computer-assisted mapping, geographic information systems (GIS) technology, and aerial photographic and imagery acquisition or products to produce 1:63,360- and 1:25,000-scale final habitat maps and digital data.  They also shall conduct technical analyses for wetland status and trend studies.  This entails conducting and refining technical tasks such as image acquisition, data preparation, image analysis, field work, digital data capture, data verification, management, and transmittal for selected status and trends intensification efforts identified by the Service. The Contractor shall provide technical training, describing new materials and equipment, technologies, on products being developed.  Training may involve contractor personnel providing presentations on techniques, development of display products and live demonstrations of computer assisted capabilities in resource mapping, data capture, data conversion, and image rectification. All wetlands observable from aerial photography or imagery in a project area shall be identified and classified using the "Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States" (Cowardin et al. 1979).  Riparian habitats will be identified and classified using "A System for Mapping Riparian Areas in the Western United States" (USFWS 1997).  All map products shall be produced using the standard protocols and conventions developed by the Service and detailed in  "Photo Interpretation Conventions for the National Wetlands Inventory" (USFWS 1995) and "Cartographic Conventions for the National Wetlands Inventory" (USFWS 1994).  Digital mapping and production will follow "Technical Procedures for Mapping Wetland, Deepwater and Related Habitats" (USFWS 1995), and mapping standards and quality control will adhere to "National Standards and Quality Components for Wetland, Deepwater and Related Habitat Mapping" (USFWS 1994).  All methodology is subject to subsequent modifications.  All digital habitat data shall be delivered in a standard ArcGIS 9.2 or higher, Geodatabase format complete with metadata. Work Statement:   The Contractor shall have full-service mapping sciences capabilities with expertise in aerial photography, photogrammetry, remote sensing, satellite image processing, GIS services, photo laboratory processing, and digital orthophotos necessary for mapping wetland habitats for the NWI program.  The Contractor shall be capable of providing natural resource habitat mapping, digitizing, technical analyses, and airborne acquisition or distribution of geographic information in photographic or digital form for Alaska in support of NWI wetland mapping projects. Due to the specialized nature of mapping, digitizing, and technical analyses of Alaska's wetland habitats, it is to the Government's advantage to work with the same contractor over an extended period of time.  This continuity will result in the development of a highly trained cadre of remote sensing specialists with the ability to consistently and accurately identify and delineate Alaska's extensive and complex wetland habitats.  The training time necessary for the Service to produce proficient wetland remote sensing specialists is considerable and difficult to accomplish when the remote sensing specialists are not located where they have access to NWI personnel for assistance.  Consistency in mapping Alaska's wetlands is critical for the Government to produce accurate wetland maps and digital data. The Contractor shall be capable of aerial photography or digital imagery acquisition, mapping, digitizing, and technical analyses to produce quality wetland maps, digital data, and status and trends analyses and studies for the NWI.  The Contractor shall be capable of demonstrating their ability to produce high quality vegetation mapping, feasibility studies, natural resource evaluations, temporal change detection and assessments, and environmental monitoring analyses. Additionally, the Contractor shall be capable of using remote sensing technology in the acquisition and use of digital, thermal, multispectral, hyper spectral and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors.  They shall use Landsat, SPOT, Indian Remote Sensing, IKONOS, Quickbird, RADARSAT, and the European Remote Sensing Satellites, and have extensive expertise with these remote sensing platforms which results in an ability to analyze and determine a wide variety of spatial relationships that are critical in any wetlands habitat mapping or status and trends study. Contact Information: Requests for full solicitation package, or submission of responses to this notice shall be submitted via parcel post, or via fax to the following prior to the closing date of February 22, 2008: US Fish and Wildlife Service Contracting and General Services 1011 East Tudor Rd, MS-171 Anchorage, AK  99503 Fax: (907) 786-3923 Solicitation may also be downloaded directly from www.fedbizopps.gov, or by accessing www.ideas.nbc.gov and entering the solicitation announcement number: 701818R010.

<DESC>THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATING A 100% SET ASIDE FOR A SERVICE DISABLE VETERAN OWNED COMPANY.  ALSO, THE QUALIFICATION OF CMMI LEVEL 3 IS REQUIRED. The eEquipment Application is a custom mobile inventory tracking and assignment application designed to work in conjunction with the Asset Inventory Management (AIM) component of AFEMS.  AIM is used to manage Information Technology (IT) and Personal Wireless Communication System (PWCS) assets at retail and wholesale levels throughout the USAF to meet peacetime and wartime mission requirements.   Initial fielding of eEquipment included support for a range of scanners from numerous vendors.  During Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 the PMO provided guidance to the AIM user community that a standard scanning hardware configuration to host the eEquipment application for use with the AIM system will be adopted through identifying and supporting an AIT designated "Best of  Breed" hardware solution. The current "Best of Breed" HW solution is defined as the INTERMEC 751G and it is considered the standard handheld to host the eEquipment  application for use with the AIM system.   The future of the eEquipment Application will be affected by an effort underway to modernize the Air Force supply management process using an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution.  It is planned that the eEquipment Application may no longer be required after implementation of ERP. This contract covers all tasks necessary to provide security, sustainment, maintenance, and Level II Help Desk support of the eEquipment Application.  Support will be for the Hand Held Terminal (HHT) that the AF determines to be the best of breed, which is currently determined to be the INERMEC 751G, starting as of 1 October 2008.  After that date any hardware upgrades to the 751G that impacts eEquipment shall be supported.  The contractor shall continue to provide Level II support for the user community for fielded eEquipment applications running on other HW while they leave the inventory through attrition, however, no new functionality or code fixes will be provided for these versions. Through this continual refinement of the eEquipment Application, it is expected that customer acceptance will increase as well as the efficiency of Major Command (MAJCOM) Equipment Control Officers (MECOs), Equipment Control Officers (ECOs) and Equipment Custodians (ECs), the target audience for this application.  The measures of success for this effort are described in the initiative objectives below.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to solicit proposals using full and open competition on an unrestricted basis as a follow-on to contract N01-ES-15478 awarded to the University of Washington.  This notice is a re-announcement of the requirement previously described under solicitation number NIH-ES-07-05 which did not result in award of a contract.

Contract objectives include 1) establish a catalog of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in prioritized environmental response genes (ERGs) based on direct re-sequencing of selected genes; 2) use high-throughput sequencing technologies for rapid sequencing analysis utilizing a national sample repository for analysis of sequence variation in the U.S. population and make this data available to the scientific community via centralized public databases; 3) develop web-based tools to display estimated haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium patterns in human populations using the EGP data sets; 4) evaluate the population distributions of estimated haplotypes and identify evolutionary patterns among the human populations represented in the polymorphism discovery resource samples; and 5) mine the sequence variation in EGP genes to highlight potential functional coding or non-coding variants for further biological testing. 

Specific performance will involve re-sequencing up to a total of seventy-five (75) gene equivalents (GE) over a four (4) year period from genomic DNA obtained from a sample of ninety-five (95) ethnically defined individuals, data entry and validation.  

The estimated release date for the solicitation is mid to late January of 2008. The estimated receipt date for proposals is early to mid March of 2008.  Electronic versions of the RFP will be available at http://www.niehs.nih.gov/omamb/rcb/rfp.htm.    All eligible responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.

<DESC>Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) of the Department of State (DoS) has a broad range of responsibilities that include protection of personnel and facilities both domestic and abroad. The Worldwide Personal Protective Services (WPPS) program is an effort by the Department of State to pre-plan, organize, set up, deploy and operate Contractor protective service details for the protection of U.S. and/or certain foreign government high-level officials whenever the need arises.

In support of Diplomatic Security's protection responsibilities throughout Iraq, the High Threat Protection Division (HTP), Office of Overseas Protective Operations (DS/IP/OPO), has recently awarded a Task Order under one of its Worldwide Personal Protective Services (WPPS II) contracts.  The Task Order  provides for delivery of regional aviation services for security service hubs within Iraq, including aviation transportation services for Search and Rescue (SAR), Medical Evacuations (ME), transporting Quick Reaction Forces (QRF) to respond to incidents, and providing limited air transportation (AT) for Chief of Mission personnel to conduct official business.

DS requires comprehensive in theater quality assurance (QA) support to monitor the performance of the aviation services contractor (ASC) and provide timely and effective input on the ASC's performance as it relates to contract compliance with the Aviation Support Task Order and WPPS II base contract to HTP.  This function should be performed with emphasis on adaptability to changing situations within a combat theater in which all parties are required to engage in creative evolution of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP).  The QA functions should include as a minimum oversight over the contractor's ability to receive, apply and distribute current TTP information.  In this regard, the QA function adds responsibilities that are not traditional to the peacetime CONUS environment.

<DESC>This solicitation requires the production and transmission of notices for the United States Bankruptcy Courts.  The services provided by the Bankruptcy Noticing Center (BNC) program include, but will not be limited to the receipt of bankruptcy case related data in electronic format, production of bankruptcy notices, distribution of notices through the United States Postal Service or by electronic transmission, using the most cost efficient, timely and effective manner, and to provide program related reports to the AO and Bankruptcy Courts.
The contractor shall furnish managerial, administrative and direct labor personnel to accomplish all work under the contract. The process of producing and preparing notices for transmission is accomplished by the Bankruptcy Court staff and other entities, such as contractors, debtors, attorneys and trustees.  Under a contract managed by the AO, the BNC electronically retrieves data from participating courts case management systems and automates the printing, addressing, batching, and mailing process.  Since its inception in 1993, the BNC program has saved the Judiciary over $67 million in noticing costs and has improved service to the Bankruptcy Courts and notice recipients.  The volume of work will be dependent on the number of bankruptcy cases filed and the number of Bankruptcy Courts that use this program.  Presently, all 90 Bankruptcy Courts utilize the BNC with the exception of the Districts of the Virgin Island, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.  At this time, it is estimated that the number of notices prepared and served by the Bankruptcy Courts in fiscal year 2007 (October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2007) will be approximately 105 million.   Historical volume information and program cost information will be provided at the time the solicitation is posted.    Currently, the Government has a contract for operating a BNC through September 2008.     
This will be a fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract (IDIQ), as well as a performance-based with an award fee.  Anticipated performance is for one base period and nine-one year periods at the option of the Government. The contract does not have a set-aside requirement for small, service-disabled veterans, minority or woman-owned, or other businesses that can be classified under Government procurement set-aside definitions.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>In the near future, TVA will be issuing a solicitation document to request proposals from experienced firms for the award of an Environmental Improvement Projects alliance.  The scope of the environmental improvement projects work may include, but will not be limited to the design, engineering, procurement, delivery, installation and/or performance of construction management services of various equipment for Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), dry Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD), precipitators, bag houses, Sulfur Trioxide (SO3) removal, mercury removal and any other environmental technologies.  In connection with this contract, the successful Contractor may perform a variety of functions involving technology selection, procurement and management of installation services, including without limitation, studies, associated balance of plant equipment and related engineering, site engineering, project management, construction management, inspection, testing, training, and startup services at any TVA facility.  Accordingly, if the successful offeror represents one particular technology then the supply of equipment for that technology must be excluded from consideration.  TVA may consider this sufficient cause to disqualify an offeror since it would preclude TVA from obtaining that particular equipment.

The pricing for all initial studies will be on a cost reimbursable basis with an award fee at risk based on performance.  Pricing for subsequent work is to be determined.  The sequence and technology selection of the installations has not been determined.  The scope of work will be defined for all planned and any potential future projects, if any, and authorized separately on a project-by-project basis according to the approved budget.  TVA may elect to expand the initial project(s) to provide for additional work at other locations.  Accordingly, TVA will award a contract(s) with a company which is, alone or in teaming arrangements or consortiums with others, capable of providing the support work in a long term alliance.  If such a contractual arrangement is entered into, TVA will reserve the right to delay commitment to subsequent projects to evaluate initial performance on the initial installation in order to better ascertain the long term suitability of the contractor.

TVA desires to select firm(s) that have a history of successful experience with environmental improvement projects that are similar to those described in the enclosure entitled Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification.  Therefore, in order to receive the RFP, TVA requires that all prospective respondents meet these requirements before being further considered.  All prospective respondents must first certify compliance with the requirements contained on the Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification.  Firms which certify to TVA that they can fully meet all of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements will receive a copy of the RFP and will be invited to attend a mandatory preproposal meeting.  All offerors will be required to present detailed data (later with their proposals) to substantiate compliance with each of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements.

In order to be considered, I must receive the enclosed Certification signed by an official authorized to bind the organization at the address shown below no later than 12 noon EST, January 14, 2008.

<DESC>Point of Contact: Michael R. Todd, Contracting Officer (425) 227-1179 Fax (425) 227- 1055 I.	Purpose: The purpose of the SIR is to seek competent and suitable sources for the subject project.  Responses to the SIR will be used to screen qualified companies. Screening information allows the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to determine which offerors are more likely to receive award, and ultimately, which offers will provide the FAA with the best value. The FAA has appointed an Integrated Product Team (IPT) which will evaluate each response received and make a selection of qualified offerors based on the evaluation criteria established in this SIR. The SIR evaluation process may involve face-to-face negotiations with one or more offerors. The intent of these negotiations is for the FAA evaluators, or IPT, to gain a better understanding of the proposed project and/or to clarify evaluation information submitted by the offeror. All offerors that are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing. Written responses to this SIR are due by close of business 4:00 pm PST on  JANUARY 8, 2008.   II.	Scope of Project: This project renovates and upgrades systems in the first and second floors of the Administration Wing-North (Dining and E-W Conference Rooms) at the Salt Lake City ARTCC.

Only emergency work to restore critical services to the facility will be considered, and moratorium waiver must be submitted and approved.  The moratorium period will not be counted against the contract construction duration for the project. The estimated contract price is from $250,000 to $500,000. The government contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract.  Offerors must be a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB) certified with the U.S. Small Business Administration.

Availability of funds: Funding for the entire subject project is not available at this time.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial services prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, and supplemental information included in this notice.  Simplified procurement procedures will be used for this acquisition per FAR Part 12 and 13.    This requirement utilized full and open competition, there are no set asides for small business.  For this acquisition, a concern will be considered small under NAICS 517110 with size standard of 1500 employees.  This acquisition is determined to be subject to Part 13, Test Program for Certain Commercial Services of the FAR regarding the acquisition of commercial services and also subject to Part 15 of the FAR regarding contracting by negotiation.  

In accordance with Air Force (AF) Instruction 33-111, the 38th EIG is the only authorized contracting office to order local exchange services for the AF including Air National Guard, AF Reserve and AF recruiting offices.  The 38 EIG/PKK has a requirement for awarding Firm-Fixed Price Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA?s) in order to, on an as needed basis?s, acquire non-personal services for local telephone exchange services for smaller AF sites and AF recruiting offices in the state listed in subject title.  All orders placed against the BPA are subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement and will be awarded as a Communication Service Authorization (CSA).   The current effort will result in multiple awards effective to begin during the entire period specified in this announcement (2013).  Each CSA order will generally have a five year period of performance but can be issued from one to 10 years as specified individually in each order.  All offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA ?Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA-Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) where services are being provided. Offers received from other than a certificated local exchange carrier with the State PUC where services are being provided will be deemed unacceptable and will not be considered.  Local communications service shall include, as a minimum but not limited to, local access for commercial business lines, DSL or internet services, voice mail, directory number and number portability, operator and directory assistance, local and Intra-LATA access, and interconnection with Inter-LATA exchange carrier. Please see below Statement of Work for details on the services requested.  Competition is open to domestic and foreign sources.  

 38 EIG/PKK intends to negotiate multiple BPA?s with qualified sources in order to competitively award BPA calls for local exchange services.  Responding to this synopsis in no manner guarantees a BPA will be negotiated with the respondent.  The establishment of a BPA with a respondent in no way obligates the government to issue any orders against the BPA.  The 38th EIG does not guarantee any minimum level of work under any resultant BPA.  Individual BPA calls will not exceed $1 million.  There will be no limit to the number of orders issued under any of the prospective ordering agreements.  The government may issue orders requiring services at multiple locations.  Only the 38 EIG will be able to issues orders against the established BPA?s.  A Past Performance/Price tradeoff process will be utilized in issuing orders under the BPA?s to obtain best value to the AF.  There is no specific commitment by either party, until dates, services, and schedule are mutually negotiated by individual orders against resulting BPA?s.   Proposal due date is to be open for the entire potential contract performance period stated in this announcement.  A respondent may at anytime attempt to become acceptable to 38 EIG/PKK requirements and submit a proposal by electronically requesting the BPA documentation from the POC?s e-mail listed in the announcement or by fax.  Phone requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION EXTENDS THE SUSPENSE DATE FOR THE SOC SUBMISSION TO FRIDAY, 11 JANUARY 2008

The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) Block 2 upgrades in support of Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) S-Band operations, Wideband Global SATCOM  (WGS) Block 2 satellites, and other MILSATCOM programs.  In addition, CCS-C architecture extensions will support NetCentric command and control and Information Assurance requirements identified by Headquarters Air Force Space Command will be supported. The CCS-C development and deployment will support the launch, on-orbit operations, and anomaly resolution of the TSAT satellites from its command and control system through the AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network). CCS-C capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interfaces with dedicated ground and payload control systems.  Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations.  Future migration to USB (Unified S-Band) waveforms and data formats shall be supported.  Contractor must be able to sustain existing CCS-C hardware, software, databases, and command procedures.  Continuing upgrades to address Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated.  

The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in FY09 lasting through FY19. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 5000 Philadelphia Way, Lanham, MD 20706-4417.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2008.  On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  

Interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Friday, 11 January 2008 demonstrating knowledge of CCS-C hardware and software design and test procedures.  The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan.  The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates.  Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Herbert Countee. 

The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length.  This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission  Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other then the incumbent exists.  Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are highly encouraged. Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/MCSW/PK, Attn: Mr Herbert B. Countee, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 1467-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Electronic submissions are acceptable and can be submitted to herb.countee@losangeles.af.mil.

<DESC>1.  THE CLOSING DATE IS EXTENDED UNTIL THURSDAY, 13 DEC 07. The U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) requests information from companies currently developing unmanned aircraft systems on the capabilities and technical maturity of your system(s).  Interested firms have the option to submit approaches to either one, two, three or all four of the UAS platforms described below.  Given the wide variety of harsh environments in which Special Operations Forces (SOF) must operate, SOF equipment requires critical design characteristics that are resistant to the potential detrimental effects of environmental conditions.  The intent of this RFI is to determine the readily available UAS capability  to withstand operations in maritime and/or austere environments.  Intended system employment is from maritime platforms to the extent that the UAV will withstand repeated landings in both fresh and salt water.  Details and requirements are listed below.
2.  This Request for Information is issued solely for market research and planning purposes. It is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is there any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. No responses received will be used as a proposal.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.  
3.  USSOCOM interest will be dependent on the results of the RFI capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and USSOCOM operational requirements analyses and determinations.

<DESC>This solicitation requires the production and transmission of notices for the United States Bankruptcy Courts.  The services provided by the Bankruptcy Noticing Center (BNC) program include, but will not be limited to the receipt of bankruptcy case related data in electronic format, production of bankruptcy notices, distribution of notices through the United States Postal Service or by electronic transmission, using the most cost efficient, timely and effective manner, and to provide program related reports to the AO and Bankruptcy Courts.
The contractor shall furnish managerial, administrative and direct labor personnel to accomplish all work under the contract. The process of producing and preparing notices for transmission is accomplished by the Bankruptcy Court staff and other entities, such as contractors, debtors, attorneys and trustees.  Under a contract managed by the AO, the BNC electronically retrieves data from participating courts case management systems and automates the printing, addressing, batching, and mailing process.  Since its inception in 1993, the BNC program has saved the Judiciary over $67 million in noticing costs and has improved service to the Bankruptcy Courts and notice recipients.  The volume of work will be dependent on the number of bankruptcy cases filed and the number of Bankruptcy Courts that use this program.  Presently, all 90 Bankruptcy Courts utilize the BNC with the exception of the Districts of the Virgin Island, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.  At this time, it is estimated that the number of notices prepared and served by the Bankruptcy Courts in fiscal year 2007 (October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2007) will be approximately 105 million.   Historical volume information and program cost information will be provided at the time the solicitation is posted.    Currently, the Government has a contract for operating a BNC through September 2008.     
This will be a fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract (IDIQ), as well as a performance-based with an award fee.  Anticipated performance is for one base period and nine-one year periods at the option of the Government. The contract does not have a set-aside requirement for small, service-disabled veterans, minority or woman-owned, or other businesses that can be classified under Government procurement set-aside definitions.

<DESC>This is an updated market survey and sources sought synopsis to identify firms with expertise in providing Automated Point of Care Technology such as bar-code enabled or other commercially available automated solutions supporting numerous aspects of hospital- based patient care.  Industry responses will aid in the understanding and development of the Government?s functional and technical requirements by identifying capabilities and functionality of commercially available systems.  In addition, responses will be utilized to aid in our determination for set-aside possibilities.  The health care industry has identified human factors as a key element in the misidentification of patients, materials or medications, delivery of the wrong service to the wrong patient, and inefficient tracking of patients and materials in the hospital setting.  The Government believes that well designed and successfully implemented automated systems can provide significant improvements in patient safety by eliminating manual steps that are error prone due to human factors.  The Government?s objective is to identify sources capable of providing Automated Point of Care Technology system that helps to ensure that critical patient care services are delivered with the greatest possible accuracy, efficiency and safety.  The Automated Point of Care Technology should have the ability to address the following three broad goals which will be applied to hospital-wide processes involved in specimen collection; blood administration; medication administration; nursing workflow; and tracking processes.  1.  Prevent misidentification errors through accurate identification of patients; and accurate identification of medications; blood products; medical records; lab specimens; medical equipment; medical supplies; and staff.  2.  Facilitate automation of workflow processes and tracking systems by Tracking of patient movement throughout the hospital; Tracking of paper medical record charts location in the hospital; Documentation of medical supplies and equipment used in the course of patient care; Tracking of medical equipment location in the hospital; and Electronically capturing data from general patient monitoring equipment such as vital sign monitors and infusion pumps.  3.  Facilitate real-time electronic verification and clinical documentation steps through Verification of correct product and or procedures at point of care as per medical order (medications, blood products, specimen collection, diagnostic procedures, therapeutic procedures, ancillary services); and Verification of correct medical record at the time of clinical documentation. The NIH Clinical Center?s requirement is for the following:  A wireless Barcode Enabled Point of Care System that is compatible with the networking and technology capabilities available in the NIH Clinical Center.  Wireless may prove incompatible with telemetry and shielding and strong magnetic fields in certain locations of the Clinical Center. If such a situation exists a wired system will be used in these locations. Therefore, the system must possess a dual capability to support both wired and wireless systems; A complete turnkey on-site implementation and project management support.; Complete hardware, including system servers, hand held system with bar-code capabilities and label printing device and additional peripherals; System Configuration; Training; Implementation Services; Maintenance; and Upgrade Services.  
1.	The NIH Clinical Center intends to incorporate automated technology solutions at the point of care with existing clinical information systems for the following patient care processes:  Laboratory specimen collection ? accurate identification of the patient at the bedside, verification of current orders for specimen collection, verification of accurate specimen labeling, documentation of specimen collection; Blood administration ? accurate identification of the patient at the bedside, verification of current orders for blood administration, verification of correct blood product, documentation of blood administration process; Medications administration - accurate identification of the patient at the bedside, verification of current orders for medications, verification of correct medication and ?five rights?, documentation of medication administration; General nursing care - accurate identification of the patient at the point of care, verification of current orders for procedures and treatment, electronic capture of patient monitoring data such as vital signs; Patient and critical materials tracking ? electronic capture of current location for patient, paper medical records, mobile clinical equipment.

<DESC>EXOTHERMIC WELDING PROCESS FOR LOAD BEARING APPLICATIONS, SPECIFICALLY AIRCRAFT CARRIER ARRESTING GEAR CABLES

This is a request for information only.  Presently no solicitation package is available.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Lakehurst, is seeking sources that have equipment and a process for applying terminals to arresting gear cables aboard aircraft carriers using exothermic welds.

The arresting gear system aboard aircraft carriers relies on a purchase cable to transfer the energy from the landing aircraft to the arresting gear engines located below the deck.  Each end of the purchase cable is fitted with a terminal.  The purchase cable terminal on the top, deck end connects to the cross deck pendant, which is engaged by the landing aircraft?s tailhook.  On the opposite end, the terminal connects the purchase cable to the arresting engine.  The purchase cable terminal is considered a critical safety item.  The failure of a terminal during an aircraft arrestment could result in the loss of life, the loss of an aircraft, or both.  After replacement (or ?rereeve?) of the purchase cable, the sailors need to attach the terminal on the flight deck in order to connect the purchase cable with the cross deck pendant.  The current process, which requires the sailor to pour molten zinc at 1000 degrees Fahrenheit into the socket terminal on a pitching, moving ship, is toxic, hazardous and workload intensive, requiring 3-5 people 6-8 hours to perform.  A safer, less workload and time consuming process is desired.

Exothermic welding is a process that has been used effectively for connecting electrical cables to ensure maximum electrical continuity.  A mold is placed around the two cables, and a powder is poured into the mold and ignited.  The resultant chemical reaction produces enough heat to fuse the two materials together, producing a molecular bond.

The Navy is interested in any sources who have developed a way of applying exothermic welding where the resultant bond is subject to load.  Rather than bonding two cables together, we would need a cable and terminal bonded together.  

The Navy's current purchase cable is steel wire rope surrounding a polyester core center, 6 x 31, Lang lay, Warrington Seale Die Formed Strand.  Diameter is 1-1/2 in.  It has a minimum breaking strength of 215,000 lbs and a weight of 372 lbs per 100 feet.  PLEASE NOTE: Any terminal/cable bond must be able to withstand the 215,000 lb load for the operational life of the cable, which is currently around 1400 arrestments.  The current poured socket is threaded, and a U-shaped bracket is screwed on to allow the purchase cable to be mated to the cross-deck pendant.

Solutions that are commercial-off-the-shelf and require a minimum of development are preferred.  In your response, please include:  unit cost, specifications, pictures, type of material and its melting point or flashpoint, what kind of facilities are required, and what measures are required to ensure highest safety standards are met.  Please provide contact info for follow up.  The response shall be in white paper (summary) format, no greater than five (5) pages, along with any supporting data/material, which shall not exceed a total of twenty-five (25) pages.  Electronic submissions are preferred.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.    Responses should cite RFI number N68335-08-RFI-0007 and be addressed the attention of Letitia Baker, Contract Specialist, 732-323-1193, Letitia.Baker@navy.mil.

<DESC>1.  The U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) requests information from companies currently developing unmanned aircraft systems on the capabilities and technical maturity of your system(s).  Interested firms have the option to submit approaches to either one, two, three or all four of the UAS platforms described below.  Given the wide variety of harsh environments in which Special Operations Forces (SOF) must operate, SOF equipment requires critical design characteristics that are resistant to the potential detrimental effects of environmental conditions.  The intent of this RFI is to determine the readily available UAS capability  to withstand operations in maritime and/or austere environments.  Intended system employment is from maritime platforms to the extent that the UAV will withstand repeated landings in both fresh and salt water.  Details and requirements are listed below.
2.  This Request for Information is issued solely for market research and planning purposes. It is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is there any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. No responses received will be used as a proposal.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.  
3.  USSOCOM interest will be dependent on the results of the RFI capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and USSOCOM operational requirements analyses and determinations.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FedBizOpps.  Potentially, future purchasing agreements may be sought to obtain systems to perform more extensive evaluation.  Pending funding levels and the availability of technical mature systems, USSOCOM may procure up to approximately 40 Tactical 1-Micro (T1-M) systems, 80 Tactical 1?Small (T1-S) systems, eight Tactical 2 (T2) systems, and/or eight Tactical 3 (T3) systems to operate in maritime and/or austere environments commencing late FY08 through FY10.
4.  Broad industry participation is desired, but USSOCOM is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production (delivery within six months).  Firms interested in providing the UAS capabilities described must illustrate succinctly in a white paper how their system(s) can meet the following capabilities: (1) how it can meet the required system capabilities, anticipated delivery timeframes and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) system cost estimates; (2) any recent and relevant past performance information illustrating fielded products designed and proven to work in the demanding corrosive seawater environment.  Special emphasis should be highlighted of systems capable of landing in and floating on water surfaces.  Contractors shall include relevant contract numbers, periods of performance, dollar value, corporate and reference points of contact, telephone numbers, and a synopsis of the work performed that is relevant to meeting the stated requirements; (3) current facility security clearance as approved in existing contracts or, if necessary, describe how required facility clearances for handling and working with unclassified controlled items would be established/maintained; and (4) current business size, a statement of capabilities, including available personnel; and a point of contact by name, address, and phone number.  The white paper response is not to exceed ten (10) pages.
5.  Interested firms are invited to submit their capabilities requirements, in writing, within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of this announcement, no later than (NLT) 2:00 PM local time to the Procurement Contracts Officer (PCO), Ms. Kim DeBois Sousa.  White papers must be sent to:  HQ UNITED STATES SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND, ATTN: SOAL-KW (Kim DeBois Sousa, PCO), 7701 Tampa Point Boulevard, MacDill AFB, FL, 33621, or e-mailed to: deboisk@socom.mil.  Questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted in a timely manner to the PCO.

Introduction and Scope of Work  The VA NJ Health Care System mission is to provide exceptional health Care to our veterans. Patients are required to have eye examinations on a yearly basis to check for retinopathy. Since it would be too costly for the VA to hire an Optometrist at each one of the Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), and it is quite a distance for some patients to travel to Lyons or East Orange, the requirement came about to contract out for these services.  In addition, the VA also mandates that patients receive their eye exam and eyeglasses within a 30 day timeframe from the date of the consult.  This contract will include eye examination and fitting for eyeglasses, but the VA will provide the eyeglasses to the veterans. 2.        Requirements/Delivery of Services The contractor shall provide a Certified, Licensed Optometrist (s) to examine veteran patients for the purpose of refraction of their eyes and writing eyeglasses prescriptions. Examinations will be conducted at the optometrist's place of business, which is within a fifteen -mile radius from the perspective VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC). The four CBOCs are located in Brick, Hackensack, New Brunswick, and Fort Monmouth.  Requests for services will be made by referral from the Community Based Outpatient Clinic primary care provider by consult.  The estimated number of veteran patients to be seen on a monthly basis is as follows:  Between 200-350 total exams a month between the existing sites above.  The qualification of personnel performing these exams will be subject to review by the Chief of Staff or the Chief of Ambulatory Care Service.  Eye examinations will include medical history (listing of systemic medications is not necessary), complete ocular history (including entering, review of any eye medications and whether the patient sees another eye care provider), refraction to include best-corrected visual acuities, assessment of pupils, confrontation visual field testing, ocular motility evaluation, slit-lamp examination with measurement of intraocular pressures and dilated fundus examinations.  Notation will be made of any medications used during the examination.  Reports will include all ocular diagnoses, explanation of any decrease in visual function and any advice given to the patient.  Any patients with ocular pathology should be referred back to the VA Eye Clinic.  If the patient prefers not to be seen at the VA Eye Clinic, the report should notate such and should indicate to whom the patient was referred. VA eyeglass forms will be completed with prescription and frame measurements (for selected frames available on VA contract-frame kits given to each contract site as samples).  A. Timeliness requirements   Patients will be scheduled and seen within 14 days of the consultation being received by the contactor. If the patient refuses to be seen within the 14 days, the contractor will inform the VA (the Administrative Officer, Ambulatory Care) so the consult can be cancelled as appropriate.  Contractor will be provided with a daily list of consults from the Brick, Hackensack, Fort Monmouth, and New Brunswick CBOCs  (to include name of patient, SS#, and phone number) in order to facilitate scheduling and patient being seen within the 14 day deadline. Reports, which include eye exam form and eyeglass prescription, will be provided to the VA within 7 calendar days of the completed examination. B. Reporting requirements/Documentation requirements Eye examinations and eyeglass prescriptions will be faxed or emailed (in a password protected document) on a daily basis (to the Administrative Officer, Ambulatory Care) for the reviewing of the exam (by the VA Chief of Optometry) and processing of the eyeglass prescription.

<SUBJECT>70--Sentillion Software MaintenanceJustification and Approval
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (FAR 6.302-1(c))  1.	Identification of the Agencies: Requesting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs 				VA Central Office  810 Vermont Avenue NW Washington, DC  20420 Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs 				IT Acquisition Center (200/00D3) 				1615 Woodward Street 				Austin, TX  78772 2.	Nature and/or description of the action:  The purpose of this action is to procure Sentillion Vergence Solution Software Maintenance and Sentillion Vault Hardware Maintenance.  Within the scope of the awarded contract, the VA will be able to continue the efficient and effective maintenance of the existing Sentillion Vergence Context Management Solution and Sentillion Vault Hardware throughout VA.  By continuing to consolidate maintenance across the enterprise, this will result in cost effective management of IT solutions which support the VA mission.    This solution has proven to be the only method of maintaining Clinical Context when using different GUI-based applications running on the same workstation in medical centers by forcing those applications to maintain the same patient context regardless of the application, and the ability to inform other GUI applications in a standards-based manner that clinically significant context is being switched by another application. 3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value): In 2002, the Department of Veterans Affairs purchased a Clinical Context Management Solution which is the Sentillion Vergence Solution and Vault Hardware.  The purpose of this procurement was to provide an ANSI HL7 CCOW (Clinical Context Object Workgroup) standard methodology by which clinical context can be managed between different GUI applications running on the same desktop environment.  The use of this context management solution adheres to the HL7 standards and improves both patient safety and clinician productivity.  The VA acquired software licenses for unlimited users for Sentillions Vergence Solution and Sentillion Vault Hardware which is now in use across the nation at 285 VA facilities.  The software must be maintained to ensure that users have access to the latest functionality of the applications.  The VA is purchasing maintenance for the software and hardware for a period of 12 months.  The acquisition will also include two 12-month option periods to ensure continuity of software maintenance for the next three years. The Sentillion Vergence Solution provides a means to allow users to access only the information and systems to which they are authorized.  This is done through a front-end security system for single sign-on and through contact management.  Creating and managing user accounts for clinical, business and personal productivity applications is more challenging in healthcare than most other industries. The Sentillion product set enables the management of user base and associated applications while meeting the needs for knowing who the users are and enhancing their productivity while ensuring system security and patient confidentiality.   4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:   This acquisition is conducted under the authority of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer and 6.302-1(c), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This is not a sole source justification; rather it is a justification to permit other than full and open competition due to a brand name requirement. 5.	Identification of the justification rationale: VA purchased the Sentillion product set and now needs to continue to provide maintenance on these products to ensure VA is eligible for the latest upgrades to better ensure security of the data.  If maintenance for the Sentillion product set is not continued, VA will need to revert to manual methods for controlling access to medical records.  This product is key in providing VA with the greatest levels of security. The VA has already incorporated this CCOW standard into several of its key clinical applications including Care Management, CPRS Version 22, VISTA Vitals, VISTA Clinical Procedures, VISTA Imaging, and VISTA Radiology.  As VistA software is re-engineered to graphical applications, it is imperative that PATIENT context be maintained between different applications running on the same desktop.   If a new product replaced the Sentillion product, multiple VA GUI applications, such as VA Kernel, Imaging, CPRS, HealtheVet Desktop (aka Care Management), Clinical Case Registry, Vista Web, Veterans ID Card and COTS products such as iMed Consent (and others in process) would have to be rewritten to use the new product.  6.	Sources Solicited: This acquisition will be solicited under the National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) Solution Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), to all SEWP contract holders (this includes multiple small, veteran owned, woman owned and 8(a) businesses). 7.	Fair and Reasonable Price: Pricing shall be determined fair and reasonable based on competitive quotes, as prescribed in FAR 16.505 (b)(1)(iv). 8.	Market Research Conducted: This procurement will be advertised in FEDBIZOPPS to provide opportunity for any interested bidders to request a copy of the solicitation.  Additionally a Request for Information was posted for review by NASA SEWP IV contract holders containing the following language:  VA seeks market research information on vendors who can provide an enterprise license for an ANSI HL7 Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) solution.  CCOW is a standard methodology by which clinical context can be managed between different GUI applications running on the same desktop environment.  The CCOW solution must adhere to the HL7 standards.  This solution will allow users to access only the information and systems to which they are authorized.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

FAR Clauses 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders--Commercial Items and ED 307-17, Conflicts of Interest and FSA 32-1, Invoice Procedures will apply to this award.

The U.S. Department of Education, Federal Student Aid intends to make an award to the Small Business that can provide IBM's Rational Premium Support Analyst for a period of 17 months at the lowest overall cost.  The Period of Performance is from 11/01/07 through 03/31/09.  Offerors must hold a current GSA Schedule 70 contract.

CIO requires IBM Rational Premium Support (RPS) until 31 March 2009 in order to meet key objectives in delivery of the Federal Student Aid mission.  The IBM RPS is required to gain access to IBM consulting staff and resources for the following efforts:

*  Operations Support of Current Rational Implementation - Access to IBM's Rational Knowledgebase and Draft Technotes is required by CIO Rational support staff to maintain and upgrade the FSA Rational environment.  Periodically, emergencies arise that also requires CIO Rational Support Staff to escalate issues and obtain resolutions to them from within IBM.

*  Re-architecting FSA's Current Rational Environment - Federal Student Aid is restructuring how it acquires systems integration services from the IT community.  This new acquisition strategy will require contractors to use FSA's Rational Suite of tools to support the development of requirements, configuration management, and test planning and execution.  FSA CIO requires IBM Rational tool expertise to re-architect its current Rational implementation.

*  Transition of Direct Loan Servicing System (DLSS) to the Virtual Data Center (VDC) in Plano, TX - One of the major systems transitioning as part of this effort is the Rational environment that is used to develop DLSS requirements, perform configuration management, and provide testing support.  FSA CIO requires IBM Rational expertise to ensure all aspects of the DLSS Rational environment are documented and implemented at the FSA VDC, and to support resolution of issues during the transition of this environment.

The place of performance is "telephone and/or web support".

Federal Maritime Commission
Performance Work Statement
Scanning Services
1. Background
The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC or Commission) is an independent regulatory agency responsible for the regulation of ocean borne transportation in the foreign commerce of the United States.  The FMC administers the Shipping Act of 1984, as amended by Public Law 105-258 (The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998), Section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988 and Public Law No. 89-777.  All of these statues were amended and modified by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which took effect on May 1, 1999.  To achieve its statutory mandates, the FMC relies heavily on technology to support its mission.

2. Objective/Scope
The FMC's objective is to obtain on-site scanning and indexing services.  The contractor is responsible for providing 40 hours per week of on-site labor, 52 weeks per year, excluding the following federal holidays:

a) New Years Day
b) Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
c) Presidents Day
d) Memorial Day
e) Independence Day
f) Labor Day
g) Columbus Day
h) Veterans Day
i) Thanksgiving Day
j) Christmas Day

3. Deliverables
Scanning/Indexing.  The contractor is responsible for utilizing the Laserfiche 7.2 document scanning software to accurately and completely scan and index documents securely in the system to ensure that they can be promptly located.  The FMC document scanning and indexing program requires the development of extensive knowledge of the FMC's specialized and unique document types.  The contractor must develop the ability to independently and accurately extract pertinent indexing information not readily apparent from a cursory review of the documents, accurately categorize each document within the indexing structure, properly evaluate the appropriate security requirements for each document, and correctly place each document in the system according to that document's security requirements.  The scanning/indexing will include a wide variety of specialized Commission documents from adjudicatory proceedings, investigative case files, enforcement proceedings, fact-finding investigations, current and historical docketed proceedings, Commission minutes, legislative matters, legal opinions, and a variety of other regulatory matters.

Quality Control.  The contractor is responsible for performing quality control by verifying that documents identified for electronic conversion have been accurately digitized, categorized, secured, and placed in the appropriate area/file within the Laserfiche system.

Re-Indexing.  The contractor is responsible for re-indexing approximately 50,000 documents recovered from a system crash of the previous scanning software, FileNet.  This task is to be incorporated into the contractor's daily duties and is to be accommodated, as time permits, after each day's scanning and indexing workload has been completed. Demonstrated experience with the FileNet system software is valuable to achieve this re-indexing task.

Recommendations.  The contractor is responsible for participating in discussions and making recommendations that identify the benefits and liabilities of available alternatives that optimize both technology and business processes in light of the FMC?s present and future needs, and participating in evaluating the FMC's current scanning and indexing structure.

Training.  The contractor is responsible for providing guidance, direction, and training to additional contractor staff and/or FMC staff as needed. Training and direction for any additional Contractor staff will include initial orientation and follow-up as needed on: (1) the FMC's business processes as they relate to the document scanning/indexing program; (2) the Laserfiche system's capabilities, functions, and features as they are applied to the FMC's document scanning/indexing program; (3) the wide variety of FMC documents - imparting guidance on how to decipher and accurately extract pertinent information to be used in the indexing process; (4) acceptable document/scanning product quality and techniques for correcting deficiencies; and (5) responses to other questions relating to the FMC's document scanning/indexing program as needed.  Training and guidance provided to FMC staff by the Contractor will include: (1) assisting OS staff in conducting, as needed, either initial or refresher training to FMC staff on basic Laserfiche system features and capabilities; and (2) responding to questions regarding researching and extracting documents scanned and stored in the FMC's Laserfiche system.

Assistance.  The contractor is responsible for assisting the FMC staff with software questions, providing research assistance, and working directly with OS/IT staff to address system issues.

Productivity.  The contractor is responsible for maintaining productivity standards, which support the FMC's document scanning and indexing program.  Written productivity standards will be provided to the Contractor within two (2) weeks of the start of the contract.  The need to update or adjust such standards will be re-evaluated annually by FMC Office of the Secretary management. Updated standards, if any, will be re-issued annually within two (2) weeks of the start of any exercised option period.

It has proposed on, and won several large-scale agreements with other Government agencies that have pushed the organization to become more integrated, efficient and competitive.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
	(a)  Introduction 
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) was developed to evaluate Contractor actions while implementing this Performance-Based Work Statement. It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring Contractor performance for each listed objective under this contract/order. 
This QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in the provision of all necessary supplies and services to ensure a successful conference. 
The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for all management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is to monitor quality assurance to ensure all contract standards are achieved. 
In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. Under the terms of the contract, the Contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of self inspections and self monitoring of its actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the Contractor to success. 

Once the quality control program is approved by OPM, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust assurance program.

	

REQUIRED SERVICE	PERFORMANCE STANDARD	METHOD OF SURVEILLANCE	INCENTIVE/DISINCENTIVE
Timeliness	All products, services and items shall be delivered within established timeframes	Visual	Incentive: Option exercise, performance rating
Disincentive: OPM elects not to exercise option
Consistency to Requirements	All products, services and items shall satisfy the requirements of the contract/order	Visual	Incentive: Option exercise, performance rating
Disincentive: OPM elects not to exercise option

Surveillance and Monitoring; An agency representative will monitor performance by a system of inspection and random sampling, any complaints received from OPM personnel will be passed on to the Contractor for correction.

	(4)	The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 2305 and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) and 253a and 253b), FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)), FAR 37.104, Personal Services Contracts (Public Law 103-332, Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, Title II, September 30, 1994, 108 Stat. 2530 as implemented by 25 U.S.C. 1638c) and FAR Subpart 37.6, Performance-Based Acquisition.

PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACT: The purpose of this solicitation is to acquire physician coverage for the Emergency Room at the Crow/Northern Cheyenne Hospital, Crow Service Unit, Crow Agency, Montana. Work shifts will normally be twelve (12) hours in length and will be worked between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. on weeknights, weekends, and holidays. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The Crow/Northern Cheyenne Hospital is a 24-bed hospital with a Level 3 Emergency Room (ER). The ER provides services to an average of 1500 patients per month. Previously ER coverage has been acquired through personal services contracts with individual physicians and locum tenens. STATEMENT OF WORK: The purpose of the position is to provide comprehensive clinical medical care (education, prevention, curative, rehabilitative and emergency) at primary and secondary levels in Emergency Services medical specialty, in both the ambulatory and inpatient setting. Examines and diagnoses health related conditions of individuals; refers individuals for consultation when appropriate; prescribes and carries out therapy in conformance with approved clinical privileges and Billings Area IHS policy. The contractor educates individuals on the nature of health related conditions, recommended therapy, and the general promotion of health and prevention of illness and disease. The contractor assists, as able, in teaching primary care medicine to medical students, physician assistants, and other health professionals. The contractor must be available for unpredictable shift coverage and inconsistent weekly/monthly work hours. Primary work functions are in the emergency room but may include walk in clinic coverage during low emergency room utilization. Provider may also be required to provide medical evaluation and treatment of emergencies, which arise on the inpatient floor when the primary or backup physicians are not immediately available. The contractor conducts initial and periodic health examinations for finding physical defects in need of correction, and prescribes and implements remedial treatments required to correct these defects. Makes necessary arrangements and authorizes the transfer of patients to the appropriate hospital. This includes authorization for admission to contract facilities for emergency medical care and surgery. The contractor must inform appropriate personnel of CHS admissions as it pertains to emergency medical services. Records patient-provider transactions in the problem oriented medical record format and completes required data collection instruments, referrals, third party billing, and medical records as required. The contractor refers patients and their families to Community Health Services personnel as appropriate for continued care and follow-up. The contractor provides medical control over the radio to EMT-Intermediate and EMT-Paramedics who provide advanced pre-hospital emergency medical services to Indian and non-Indian patients on the Crow Reservation in Big Horn County. Additional Requirements: Board Certification in Emergency Medicine, Family Practice, Internal Medicine, or Internal Medicine/Pediatrics; Medical Practice experience of at least four years (residency included), with two years of ER experience; must possess current ACLS certification (Certification can not be lapsed for more than 1 year); current ATLS Certification (Certification can not be lapsed for more than 1 year); and current PALS or APLS Certification (Certification can not be lapsed for more than 1 year). The Federal Tort Claims Act coverage for medical related claims is extended to the individual providing services pursuant to this contract; however, the services must be within the scope of the personal service contract. The contractor must possess a thorough knowledge of the general primary care fields of internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics in order to treat a majority of patients. He/she must possess a specialized knowledge of the concepts, principles and practices of Emergency Medical Practice such as is obtained through the successful completion of a course of study leading to a degree of Doctor of Medicine or Osteopathy at an approved school, and the successful completion of post graduate training in an approved residency program. Board eligibility in the specialty of emergency medicine, family practice, internal medicine, or pediatrics is also required. The contractor must possess a license to practice medicine in the United States. Guidelines available to the contractor and that must be adhered to include PHS/IHS Billings Area, Service Unit, and Medical Staff regulations, policies, procedures, and by-laws. In addition, traditional and currently accepted medical practices are available in the form of specialty consultation, medical journals, and textbooks. In nearly all cases, however, the physicians judgment is the key factor in determining whether guidelines are to be adhered to or deviated from or whether guidelines need to be developed to protect the interests of the patient. The work consists of a broad general practice of medicine involving evaluation and diagnosis, and treatment of inpatients and outpatients with an extremely wide variety of physical and emotional problems. It also includes the broad functions of medicine: education, prevention, cure and rehabilitation as they pertain to emergency medicine. Assignments are characterized by breadth and intensity of effort and generally involve the simultaneous application of multiple distinct skills, knowledge, and abilities in the care of one or more patients. The work is often difficult and further complicated by the fear and skepticism of patients undefined or ill-defined problems presented in advanced stages, and conflicting data. The work requires continued efforts to establish programs to resolve chronic medical problems among the population served.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to provide a complete and revised answer to a previous question submitted.  
The question and answer are as follows:

Question
1. Could you provide clarification as to which types of pest control licenses would be required for the work. Would mosquito larva and adult mosquitoes be included in this work?

Specification says:

1 The Pest Control Functions shall include control of but not limited to birds, snakes, mice, ants, ticks, fleas, gnats, flies, chiggers, beetles, bees, termites, lady bugs, wasp, hornets and spiders as listed below:
(a) Household Pest Control
(b) Structural Pest Control
(c) Stored Products Pest Control
(d) Control of Pests of Medical Importance
(e) Ornamental and Turf Pest Control
(f) Miscellaneous Pest Control

1a.     From the categories listed, it seems that it does require Maryland Department of Agriculture license category 3a 3b, 7a 7b, 7c. Mosquito management would add category 5 and 8.

Answer

1. The Government would like mosquito larva and adult mosquito pest control services to be included within all of the proposals.

1a. The Government will require all interested parties to comply with all state and federal laws pertaining to mosquito control including Maryland Department of Agriculture license categories 3a 3c, 7a 7b, 7c and mosquito management category 8 will apply. 

It should be noted that license category 3c is required rather than 3b.  3c is for Turf and 3b is for interior plantscapes which are not appicable for this action. Also, Category 8 is required for mosquito control (Cat 5 was broken out and separated 2 years ago). 

Please take a minute to make sure that proposal submitted are complete. Regarding proposal submittals, please review the original Solicitation 132504 dated Dec. 4, 2007, under Description, paragraph four (4), where it states The Offeror is required to propose their best solution and submit a detailed cost proposal. Please submit copies of all technical and cost volumes associated with this proposal package separately.     The technical volumes shall address Offerors approach to meeting requirements.

**All responsible Offerors shall submit proposal electronically to Charles James at charles.james@usss.dhs.gov or via fax at (202) 406-6801, to be received NLT 12:00pm Friday January 11, 2008**

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 04 January 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 03 January 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Dennis Gaines at 252-335-6713.

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

Special Notices to Offerors

a) The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government.  Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C 423) (hereinafter referred to as the Act) as implemented in FAR.

b) Upon receipt, all responses to this RFP become Government property.

Submission of Complete Proposals
Offerors are cautioned to strictly comply with all instructions within this solicitation to ensure submission of a complete proposal.  Failure to furnish a complete proposal, at the time of proposal submission, may result in the proposal being unacceptable to the Government and elimination from consideration for award.

Proposal Format and Submission Instructions
Deadline for Receipt of Proposals is January 22, 2008 no later than 12:00.   Offerors assume full responsibility for ensuring that their proposals are received by the due date and time. Each proposal shall consist of two volumes:

	Volume I -  Technical Capability, electronic or original and 3 CD copies to include all data and information required for evaluation, and exclude any reference to the pricing aspects of the offer and shall include the following:  
Factor 1.  Technical Approach - IDIQ
Factor 2.  Past Experience with budget formulation and resource management software/modules
Factor 3.  Qualification of Key Personnel Proposed in Phase One

	Volume II - Price Proposal, electronic or original and 3 CD copies to include the completed solicitation documents and a complete and detailed cost breakdown with all supporting information requested in the Cost Breakdown portion of this solicitation.  Price evaluation will be conducted on each of the phases to determine price fair and reasonableness.

General Information - Submission of Proposals (Best Value)
Offerors are cautioned that the quality of their proposal and adherence to solicitation response requirements and/or restrictions are considered reflective of the manner in which the Offeror could be expected to conduct integration services and will be given due consideration throughout the evaluation process.  Offerors are cautioned that failure to provide all the required information may make the offer unacceptable and may result in elimination of the Offeror from further consideration award.

Volume I submissions are limited to the maximum number of pages in length of 20.  Each "page" is defined as one sheet, 8 " x 11", with at least one inch margins on all sides, using a font with a point size of 12 points or greater with no more than 15 characters per inch (e.g. Times New Roman style with 12 point font).  Lines shall, at a minimum, be single spaced.   Pages shall be consecutively numbered.  Multiple pages, double pages, two-sided pages, and foldouts will count as an equivalent number of 8 " x 11" pages.  

The cover sheet, table of contents (not to exceed one page per volume), tabs, and dividers will not count toward the page limit. The cost proposal (Volume II) is not page limited.  However, the cost proposal is to be strictly limited to cost and price information.  

Resume(s) for Key Personnel for Phase One submitted as part of the offerors technical approach will not count toward the page limit for the Technical Proposal but may not exceed two (2) pages each for any resumes(s).

Evaluation Factors
The OCC will use the following factors to evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR 12.203 and FAR 15.304.  Technical capability is more important than past performance, but when combined technical capability and past performance are significantly more important than price.

1.	 Technical Capability

Technical capability ensures that the vendor is capable of fulfilling the OCCs solicitation requirements.  The OCCs assessment of technical capability will focus on the following:

  	 1) Technical approach and performance work statement in accordance with the Statement of Objectives, focusing on potential tasks contained in 3.1-3.5 of the SOO; 
	   2) Prior Experience with the resource management and budget formulation software and platforms; and 
       3) Qualifications of Proposed Key Personnel for Phase 1 (as provided in resume format).

2.	 Past Performance

For offerors without a record of relevant past performance, they shall not be rated favorably or unfavorably on past performance pursuant to FAR 15.305.

Offerors shall describe its past or current performance for three contracts.  Past performance should include similar scope, magnitude and complexity to that which meets to general details as provided for within the solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of the solicitation.  The offeror should provide the following information regarding its past performance:

a) Contract Number(s);
b) Name and phone number of a point of contact at the Federal, State, Local Government or commercial entity for which the contract was performed;  
c) Dollar value of the Contract;
d) Detailed description of the work performed;
e) Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any and a description of the extent of work   performed by the subcontractor(s); and
f) The number, type and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken and the effectiveness of the 
corrective action.

3. 	Price

Volume II, Containing the pricing for the three phases listed under the Cost Schedule, as well as estimated hourly pricing for the labor categories listed under the second section of the Cost Schedule, will be the basis for price evaluation.

Determination of Best Value

The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria below. The best value tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101 -1 permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or the highest technically rated proposal. 

To be responsive the offeror must address all the requirements of the solicitation and must include all information specifically required in all sections of the solicitation. The offeror must state how it will meet the requirements; repeating back the words of the RFP or responding with product sales literature is not acceptable. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions; therefore, each initial offer shall contain the Offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  If the Government decides that discussions are necessary, the CO may establish a competitive range of the most highly rated proposals.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  

The failure of an Offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement of the RFP may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and thus eliminated from the competition.  The realism of rates will be part of the proposal evaluation.  Unrealistic rates and pricing solutions, as determined by the Contracting Officer, will be considered in the risk assessment and may result in a reduced score.  OCC will award a contract to the Offeror of a proposal that is judged, by an integrated assessment of all of the evaluation factors, to be the best value to the Government.

<DESC>This solicitation is hereby amended to address vendor question and answers that have been received for this requirement.  The due date for quotes remains unchanged and all responses must be submitted no later than 3:30pm, local time on December 19, 2007 for consideration.
Question: What material are the floor, ceiling and walls made from?
Answer: The accordion doors will be mounted inside existing closets that have the opening sizes referenced within the notice.  The flooring will be existing carpet, the walls are plaster and the ceiling where the doors shall be mounted is either drywall or plaster.  
Question: Are these replacement doors?
Answer:  Yes, these are replacement doors, but not exact replacements.  These are replacing inexpensive, plastic/vinyl doors that are not consistent with the decor in the room.
Question:  Will the old doors need to be disposed of? 
Answer: Yes, the existing doors shall be discarded. 
Question:  What are STC requirements?
Answer:  The STC requirements are minimal since these doors will be used on closets. 
Question:  Natural wood accordion doors that are fire rated are difficult to locate, would vinyl with wood appearance be considered?
Answer: Spec (10) states "For performance requirements, the door panel CORE material shall be class 1 fire retardant, not the wood veneer.  Vinyl is not acceptable.
Question: Can the overhead mount be made of wood?
Answer: The overhead is concealed for the most part.  The track is metal, whatever the track is attached too can be wood, but must be finished. 
Question: Do all 5 doors stack to 1 side?
Answer: Doors shall stack both sides from the center.
Question:  There are four (4) wood species available (Birch, Walnut, Oak and Mahogany) each has a different cost. Please advice species required.
Answer: The hardwood type is not as critical as the color match to the existing surroundings.  Birch or maple stained to a darker walnut tone is acceptable. Factory stained Birch, or something comparable, to match the surrounding walnut tones will be sufficient.  Samples must be submitted for selection.
Question:  Is installation on first floor or an upper floor? If and upper floor, can equipment travel by elevator? 
Answer: The work is being performed on two separate floors (basement and first floor level), both accessible by doors and not requiring elevator usage.
Question: Can installation be done during normal business hours?
Answer: Installation may be required to be performed evening or weekends. It is possible it could be done during regular hours, but until NIST knows the exact delivery time of the doors, NIST cannot set aside regular time for the conference rooms to be closed.  Therefore, there is a possibility for the need for work outside of normal business hours.
Question:   Is there a wage scale requirement?
Answer:  Yes, In accordance with 52.2222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965, Wage Determination No.: 2005-2103, Revision No. : 4 dated 07/05/2007 shall apply.
