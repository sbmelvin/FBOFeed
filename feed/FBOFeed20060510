Source selection procedures are identified in FAR Part 15.3, and will incorporate the tradeoff process identified in FAR 15.101-1. This method will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, including the past performance of their subcontractors, qualified/experienced personnel and on their price proposals. All proposals are required to address each of the qualifications. Omission of any of the criteria may render the proposal nonresponsive, preventing the opportunity to submit a price proposal and gain further consideration for award.  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors will be considered equal to cost. The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are as follows: 1) Past Performance and Experience on Similar Projects.  Identification of projects, size, location, references, previous client assessment of offeror's performance, address project completion time and budget history. Offerors should provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.  Regarding past performance, offerors with no relevant performance history shall provide information, which helps to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the requirement.

<CONTACT>Verdetta Weaver, Contract  Specialist, Phone 813 828 5436, Fax 813 828 7504, Email weaverv@socom.mil - Susan Griffin, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-828-7411, Fax 813-828-7504, Email griffi1@socom.mil
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command has a requirement for a five year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract issuing firm fixed price (FFP) delivery orders to procure a family of ballistic plates for the Body Armor Load Carriage System (BALCS) to improve the survivability and mobility of Special Operation Forces (SOF).  The family of ballistic protective armor will maximize ballistic protection while minimizing the burdens of weight, bulk and heat stress.  This will be achieved with the use of three (3) different plate technologies available in different cuts.  The components will integrate with the existing BALCS Releasable Body Armor Vest system providing the ability to increase or decrease ballistic protection and load.  Patterns will be provided to ensure components integrate with the body armor vests systems.  The ballistic protective components will be selected on a performance basis in order to take advantage of most current technologies.  The three systems include, 1) BALCS System:  One cut of ballistic plate that can be used as a back or a front and conform to the pattern provided.  Areal density shall not exceed 6.5 pounds per square foot and thickness of the plates shall not exceed .750 inches; 2) Tactical Stand Alone Ballistic System:  Three cuts of ballistic plate conforming to patterns provided.  Areal density shall not exceed 6.9 pounds per square foot and thickness of the plates shall not exceed 1.0 inches; and 3) Low Visibility Ballistic System: Three cuts of ballistic plate conforming to patterns provided.  Areal density shall not exceed 4.8 pounds per square foot and thickness of the plates shall not exceed .85 inches.  The plates must have been previously ballistically tested (both conditioned and unconditioned); and the proposed BALCS System must have been previously tested in conjunction with a soft armor component with an areal density not to exceed 1.1 lbs.  The test data must demonstrate systems conform to the following ballistic thresholds:  BALCS System and Tactical Stand Alone Ballistic System must defeat 2 shots at 4 inches apart.  None of the shots may be closer than 1 inch from any given edge of the plate being tested.  Both the Tactical Stand Alone and Low Visibility systems will include a small cut and must meet only a 1st shot requirement.   Ballistic testing must have been performed in accordance with the general provisions of MIL-STD-662, NIJ 0101.04 and MIL-C-44050A test protocols for Level IV.  Conditioning shall include High and Low Temperatures, Gasoline, Motor Oil and Break Free as well as Sea, and Chlorine Water Immersion.  The systems in the proper configuration, must yield the minimum V50 ballistic limit measurements at 0-degree obliquity with the following specified test projectiles:  BALCS System and Tactical Stand Alone Ballistic System – (1) NATO 7.62 x 51 mm M-80 Ball at 2,750 + 50 feet per second, (2)  Soviet 7.62 mm x 54R Ball Type LPS at 2,300 + 50 feet per second, (3)  U.S. 5.56 mm M855 Ball at 3,250 + 50 feet per second, (4)  7.62mm x 63 APM2 at 2850 + 50 feet per second (only two impacts at 0 degree obliquity required) and Low Visibility Ballistic System - (1) Soviet 5.45 X 39 FMJ 2950 + 50 feet per second, (2) Soviet 7.62 X 39 Mild Steel Core (MSC) Ball 2400 + 50 feet per second, (3)  7.62 X 39 Armor Piercing Incendiary (API) 2400 + 50 feet per second, and (4) U.S. 5.56 mm M855 Ball at 3,250 + 50 feet per second.  The desired backface deformation is 1.73 inches (44 mm) for all plates.  The minimum quantities, per plate technology, will be 300 each or 150 plate sets where applicable.  The maximum quantities, per plate technology, will be 140,000 each or 70,000 plate sets where applicable.  In addition, a Subcontracting Plan will be required of large businesses.   Any textile products must be Berry Amendment compliant.   The Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts.  The offeror will be required to provide Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) with proposal submission for evaluation.  PDMs shall consist of 2 of each size (One Size, Small, Medium, Large and XLarge) of each plate and cut offered.  The total PDMs to be provided are as follows:  BALCS - 8 plates, Tactical Stand Alone - 18 plates, Low Visibility - 18 plates.  This is not an R&D contract; offerors must have an existing U.S. verifiable production line for any product proposed under this solicitation.  Participating offerors will be required to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to receive the OZALID patterns and submit a proposal.  NOI must include the following: systems the offeror intends to bid on, cage code number, DUNS number, state of incorporation, corporate license number, identify if foreign owned or a controlled company with full identification of the parent corporation, country of affiliation, identify whether subcontractors are foreign, identify vendor, foreign country of affiliation and what physically constitutes the foreign content of their product(s).  NOI will be required no later than 4:00pm est., two weeks after the solicitation is posted.  Only those offerors who submit a Notice of Intent and whose Quality Assurance Representative has verified the production facility, will receive the OZALID patterns with specific weight limits for each size, and may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  A Go/No Go evaluation will be performed to verify the following requirements:  (1) Appropriate number and sizes of PDMs have been submitted (2) Ballistic test data from either a government owned laboratory or an independent laboratory demonstrating that the submitted plates have been tested as specified, (3) Weight, Areal Density and Thickness, (4) Conformance to all measurements, tolerances and radius indicated in the OZALID patterns and (5) ISO 9000 or equivalent certifications.  Any proposals not meeting the Go/No Go criteria will be immediately disqualified.  Components passing the Go/No Go criteria shall proceed to a full technical proposal, which will include review and in-depth evaluation of: (1) Ballistic data, (2)  Durability,  (3) First Article Test Plan, (4) Delivery/Surge rates, (5) SPEAR Unique Quality Assurance Plan, (6) Production Ballistic Lot Test Plan, (7)  Supply Chain Management (8) Warranty, (9) Part Numbers, (10) Configuration Management Baseline, (11) Program Management and (12) Labels, Packaging and Marking.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division intends to procure technology sharing/utilization services for the United States Joint Forces Command’s Joint System Integration Command (JSIC).  The services to be performed include support for Strategic Interoperability Solutions (SIS) Program, program management support, consortium management support, Joint Task C2 interoperability support and special studies support.  The proposed procurement is being processed on an other than full and open competitive basis with South Carolina Research Authority (SCRA) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  The proposed action will result in a cost plus fixed fee contract with four, twelve month option periods.  SCRA is the only firm capable of providing the above described services since they have developed the proprietary software tools and engineering processes and technologies essential to the successful interoperability and continued functionality of the targeted operating systems/environments.  The proprietary software tools and engineering processes and technologies include: Rapid Acquisition of Manufactured Parts (RAMP), Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data (STEP), Quote Commerce Access Broker (QCAB), Product Data Access and Retrieval Internet Server (PARIS), STEPTrans, STEPValidator and STEPPlan.  It would be unreasonable to consider that another contractor would be capable of duplicating or providing under license the present SCRA expertise with proprietary tools solely for the provision of this requirement.  All interested parties should respond outlining their capability to provide the required services along with documented evidence of their company’s experience and past performance with the SCRA developed tools and programs.  In order to be considered, responses must be received within fifteen (15) days after publication of this notice. Responses should be submitted in writing to FISC Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division, Attn: Susannah Weigner-Clark, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111.

The statutory authority permitting this award under other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1. Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for highly specialized equipment including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport intends to award on a sole source basis, a Firm Fixed Price contract to BBN Technologies for services involving the use of BBN’s proprietary computer program, ELTRA, which models multilayer media subjected to incident wave excitation.  Recent broadband sonar design studies and at-sea measurements have shown both signal loss and undesirable phase variations primarily due to thickness and material used for the sonar window.  Radically different window materials and thickness may be desirable for broadband sonar.  This work proposes to examine the performance of thin, stiff, lightweight acoustic windows designed to operate over a broad frequency bandwidth.  ELTRA will aid in the development of a broadband array design.  Although various mathematical approaches have been used to analyze the performance of multilayered acoustic transmission models, only ELTRA allows for a closed-form solution to multilayered transmission problems.

NUWCDIVNPT plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in March or April 2006 for the procurement of TR-317 Transducer Assemblies. To allow prospective bidders the opportunity to begin planning for this procurement, NUWC will make the Specification and drawings available to eligible companies in January 2006. The drawings and specification can be obtained by emailing requests to Matthew F. Grzyb [grzymf@npt.nuwc.navy.mil].
The RFP will reflect a build to performance specification in accordance with NAVSEA Drawing No. 53711-5517024  ( Critical Item Product Specification for TR-317 Transducers). The CIPS, contains a classified appendix, and therefore a valid security clearance will be required. Two drawings packages (i.e.TR-317B Transducer and TR-317C Transducer) will be provided as part of the solicitation (upon request) for informational purposes only. The government does not warrant any of the data in the TR-317 production drawing package and a "build to print" approach may not constitute an adequate technical response. Drawings are restricted to distribution to US companies and can not be distributed to foreign countries without a proper export license.
It is expected that the solicitation will be issued under full and open competition.  The resulting contract is anticipated to be a 5 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with Firm Fixed Priced provisions.  The Government plans to award the contract by September 2006. The potential value for the five year contract is approximately $20M (subject to budget changes).  The procurement plans for the five year contract, which are subject to budget changes, are as follows:  
Year 1:  50 First Article Transducers, 90 Production Transducers (subject to First Article approval), Level III Drawing Package, 
Technical Repair Standard.  Years 2:  1000 Production Transducers, and Year 3 thru 5:  1000 -2000 Production Transducers per Year.  The estimated delivery requirement for First Article transducers is 15 months after contract award. The Government anticipates that the contract will include a delivery incentive of $25K per month, for each full month that delivery exceeds the 15 month contractual requirement (up to a max of 3 months or $75,000.00).  This delivery incentive will only apply to First Article units.  Delivery requirements for subsequent production deliveries are 18 months after either First Article approval or 18 months after award of Delivery Order.  The CIPS for this transducer contains an extraneous noise requirement and the contractor will be required to develop and build a noise test facility to perform production lot noise testing. The costs of this facility will be separately priced.  NUWC will also make available to eligible companies an existing TR-317C transducer from Navy stock. The unit will be provided upon request.  Please email requests for existing TR-317C transducers to Matthew F. Grzyb [grzymf@npt.nuwc.navy.mil].  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate a follow-on contract with Rockefeller University (PI: Dr. Nathaniel Heintz, contact # N01-NS-0-2331, awarded 9/30/00) in order to: 1) continue the high-throughput analysis of gene expression patterns in the mouse nervous system during development; and 2) generate new mouse genetic research tools for the scientific community.  Using two complementary and coordinated technologies (BAC transgenic reporter mice and standard radiometric in situ hybridization), the contract screens probes for a large number (e.g., thousands) of gene products on a relatively limited number (10 to 20) of sections of the nervous system.  Planes of section are chosen by the NINDS to include the structures of most general interest to the neuroscience community (e.g., neocortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum, spinal cord, etc.).  The spatial locations/patterns of gene expression are analyzed at 3 or 4 stages of development (early and late embryonic, and early postnatal) and in adult mice.  The resulting images of gene expression are digitized and posted in Web-accessible databases, and all BAC transgenic mice generated by the contract are deposited in an NIH-sponsored mouse repository.  Background:  With the completion of the Human Genome Project, a major focus of biomedical research is to unravel the functions of the ~22,000 genes expressed in the mammalian genome.  A crucial and often early step in understanding a gene’s function is to decipher where and when a gene is expressed in an organism, both in normal development and under different physiological and pathological conditions.  In neurobiology, the task is even more challenging: the thousands of cell types, the intricate anatomy and elaborate circuitry require sophisticated technologies to reveal patterns of gene expression at a detailed cellular and subcellular level in the nervous system.  The systematic and high-resolution mapping of the distribution of genes in specific cells and circuits promises to yield new insights into brain development, function and disease.  Of the estimated 15,000-16,000 genes expressed in the brain, fewer than a third have been analyzed to any extent and/or have expression data in the CNS, and only a fraction of these are considered to be well-characterized.  Thus, the GENSAT (Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas) contract, awarded to Rockefeller University has developed high-throughput technologies to map the cellular locations of thousands of genes expressed in the mouse CNS throughout development – i.e., from embryonic to early postnatal ages and into adulthood.  GENSAT uses two complementary and coordinated technologies, BAC transgenic reporter mice and standard radiometric in situ hybridization, to create a publicly accessible “4-dimensional map” revealing the spatial locations and patterns of gene expression throughout the brain and spinal cord over developmental age.  As a public resource, all data are posted in Web-accessible databases and all resources including the BAC transgenic mouse lines generated by the contract are deposited in NIH or other public repositories.  New Objectives for the GENSAT Follow-on Contract:  The current GENSAT contract expires at the end of February 2007, and the NINDS intends to negotiate a follow-on contract with Rockefeller University for an additional five years of funding.  Based on the prior successes of the GENSAT project, we expect that the contract will continue to produce outstanding, high-resolution gene expression data on a large scale along with important and powerful new tools for the neuroscience community.  For the next 5-year contract period, the NINDS plans to continue to implement the GENSAT contract as described in the Background Section and will initiate requesting performance of the following:  1.  Increase the throughput of the BAC transgenic component to ~300 genes per year.  This includes a target estimate of approximately 25-50 BAC transgenic lines per year for the creation of state-of-the-art functional genetic tools such as BAC-Cre recombinase “driver” mice (for conditional cell-specific gene manipulation), and BAC-array mice (a new technology that allows the isolation of mRNA from specific cell populations for microarray gene expression profiling).  2.  Increase the throughput of the in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis from 1100 to 1500 genes per year in order to map the expression of ~12,000 nervous system genes by 2012 (the end of the next 5-year contract period).  3.  Continue development and implementation of the infrastructure and bioinformatics of the GENSAT contract.  This includes i) establishing a multi-site data management and (gene) tracking system for both internal and public use; and ii) adopting more sophisticated bioinformatics approaches (e.g., text-based mining approaches, microarray and other expression screens) to aid in gene selection (particularly of novel genes) for GENSAT.  4.  Improve the annotation of the expression data and develop better informatics and/or atlas tools to allow a user easier and enhanced access to the gene expression information in the databases.  This includes conducting finer-level annotation of brain regions and/or specific cell-types in the BAC transgenic mice (particularly important with the targeting of cell-type specific BAC vectors) and annotating the locations/levels of gene expression in the major brain structures of the ISH images.  Create or implement new brain atlas tools which allow the user to analyze more easily the gene expression images and align/compare the expression images with an annotated (anatomical) Nissl reference atlas.  5.  Continue to develop the infrastructure and capabilities to analyze gene expression in other key areas of the nervous system such as the eye and ear and selected peripheral pathways (e.g., DRGs, trigeminal ganglia) in addition to the brain and spinal cord.  This includes generating the BAC transgenic mice on another genetic background (for example, backcrossing the FVB/N transgenic founders to C57Bl6) that is less prone to defects of the eye (or ear) to ensure that the nervous system gene expression is the reflection of functioning sensory structures.  Technical Requirements:  Work under this program requires performance of two interdependent and complementary components for analysis of gene expression in the developing and adult mouse nervous system: Part 1) an initial in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis of large numbers of candidate genes each year; Part 2) a subsequent, more comprehensive analysis of selected genes (generally chosen from the ISH prescreen) in bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-EGFP transgenic reporter mice along with the creation of functional genetic research tools for the scientific community.  First, using radiometric in situ hybridization technology, the contractor shall prepare and deliver expression data for new candidate genes at a target rate of at least 1500 genes per year for the base contract and each option; each gene shall be analyzed at four developmental ages (E11.5, E15.5, P7 and P42) in the brain, spinal cord and retina of mice.  The contractor shall demonstrate the capability of scaling up to a throughput rate of 2500 genes per year if requested by the Government.  The ISH screen will be used to guide the selection of candidate genes for subsequent analysis in BAC-EGFP reporter mice.  Second, for at least 250 of the 1500 candidate genes analyzed in each Option Year, the contractor shall conduct a more thorough analysis of their cellular locations and patterns of expression in the nervous system of BAC-EGFP reporter mice; each gene shall be analyzed at three developmental ages (E15.5, P7 and P42) in the brain, spinal cord and other selected nervous system structures (as specified by the project officer) of BAC-EGFP mice.  The contractor shall demonstrate the capability to increase the gene target throughput rate by 20%, if requested by the Government.  From the BAC-EGFP reporter analysis (and as directed by the NINDS and the GENSAT Advisory Panel), the contractor shall target an additional 25 to 50 genes per year for the generation of state-of-the-art functional genetic research tools for distribution to the scientific community (for example, BAC-Cre recombinase “driver” mice or BAC mice expressing epitope-tagged ribosomal proteins to be used for cell-specific gene expression profiling).  For both the ISH and BAC transgenic analysis, the contractor shall annotate all sections for locations and patterns of gene expression, and shall ensure the quality and accuracy of all data and images submitted to the Government under this contract.  The contractor is expected to maintain a central data management and (gene) tracking system for all contract and subcontract sites (as may be applicable) as described below, and to develop and implement bioinformatic strategies to assist with gene selection/prioritization for the entire project.  Expression images from the contract shall be delivered to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and posted on (or submitted to) other publicly-accessible websites as appropriate.  All BAC transgenic mice generated from the contract will be deposited in the UC Davis Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) or another national repository as directed by the NINDS.  The NINDS believes that the Rockefeller University is the only known source to have the capability for high throughput analysis of gene expression patterns in the mouse nervous system using the technologies and approaches described above and producing outstanding, high-resolution gene expression data that is also consistent and compatible with the data currently in the databases.  At the present time, the NINDS is unaware of any other organization, public or private, that has in place existing capabilities that are at the same development and current level of performance (i.e., the equipment, laboratory, animal facilities, technical expertise or professional capabilities) to compete for this requirement, particularly at the quality, consistency and throughput rate stipulated by the contract.  Inability to produce high-resolution gene expression data on a large scale would lead to delays in the development of the GENSAT database and incurrence of duplicate costs to get to where we are today, both of which would be unacceptable to the Government.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302.  The Rockefeller University is considered the only source capable of performing the high throughput analysis and has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their current experience and work under the contract to date.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR SILICON CARBIDE POWDER PRODUCTION AND CERAMIC ARMOR MANUFACTURING.  This is a pre-solicitation synopsis which is not a request for competitive proposals.  The work will involve an alpha grade silicon carbide (SiC) powder production and ceramic armor manufacturing initiative to expand production capacity, to comply with government performance specifications and quality levels, and to fully qualify new or expanded production capabilities in order to satisfy growing DoD demand.  The DPA Title III Program Office intends to award a contract or assistance instrument, as appropriate, on the basis of other than full and open competition for this requirement to Superior Graphite Co., 4021 Calvin Drive, Hopkinsville, KY 42240.  Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to expand alpha grade SiC powder production capacity at a domestic, merchant supplier of high quality alpha grade SiC powder for use in ceramic armor.  Ceramic armor production capacity may also be established or expanded as part of this initiative.  Additionally, qualification work with Government agencies and/or ceramic armor manufacturers will be required to ensure government product requirements are met.  The type of SiC powder required for ceramic armor manufacturing is alpha grade SiC, which is hexagonal in structure, harder than other grades, and highly sinterable.  Alpha grade SiC powder is the principal ingredient in ceramic body armor which is worn by troops in all branches of the military; it is also utilized for vehicle armor and naval vessel hulls.  Note: For this program, the offeror must be a domestic, high volume, merchant producer of alpha grade SiC powder and must be able to demonstrate significant marketing/customer sales experience with SiC powder in the field of ceramic armor.  The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 2-3 years.  Key tasks will include: Expand production capacity of alpha grade SiC powder in line with DoD demand; create or expand production capability for SiC based ceramic armor;  provide a plan for operational efficiency improvements, product enhancements, and quality improvements to meet government user needs; provide an analysis of the SiC powder and ceramic armor marketplaces; develop and implement customer product qualification plans, and establish a comprehensive strategic business plan including a marketing communications program for both Government and commercial applications. The offerers ability to demonstrate production capability of alpha grade SiC powder and to accomplish the goals of this program will be assessed based on the offerors demonstrated leadership in this product category and ability to effectively address challenges facing future developments in the SiC powder and ceramic armor industries.  The government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), Only One Responsible Source or DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400 (b), based on the aforementioned requirements, as well as an assessment of technical and programmatic risk to the Government.  Offerors who are capable of meeting the requirements stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  This documentation shall specify the offerors area of expertise and experience.  It shall identify the offerors current production capacity and utilization of alpha grade SiC powder and ceramic armor.  Current customers and product applications will also need to be identified.  Documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered as a merchant industrial supplier along with market share in each area. The documentation shall identify relevant production experience, and a listing of both commercial and government customers that currently utilize the offerors alpha grade SiC powder and ceramic armor products.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.  Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement.    Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Kwajalein Atoll/Reagan Test Site (USAKA/RTS) has a requirement for Meteorological Support Services (MSS).  This effort will be a competitive set aside for small disadvantaged business pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Small Busin ess Act.   A TOP SECRET facility clearance is required for this effort.  Foreign participation will not be allowed at the prime or subcontract level.    The planned period of performance is a 36-month basic effort with two option periods of 24 months each.  The planned contract type is cost-plus-fixed-fee, level-of-effort.  Release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected in late May 2006.  Contract a ward is planned for November 2006.  These dates are for planning purposes only and are subject to change.  USAKA/RTS is located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) approximately 2,100 nautical miles west-southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, 9 degrees north latitude and 167 degrees east longitude, approximately 700 miles north of the equator, in an intertrop ical convergence zone (ITCZ).  USAKA/RTS is located west of the international dateline resulting in a normal government workweek of Tuesday through Saturday, which corresponds with the Continental United States Monday through Friday workweek.  USAKA/RTS i s home for approximately 2,500 U.S. Government civilian, military, and contractor personnel who perform various roles in support of the missions of USAKA/RTS.  USAKA/RTS provides substandard unaccompanied housing and limited family housing, limited dental and medical facilities, schools (preschool  12), dining facilities, department and grocery stores with limited choices, recreational activities and most of the amenities of a small town of comparable size.  The primary mode of transportation is bicycle wi th no privately owned motor vehicles allowed.  As a Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), RTS is required to provide meteorology support as part of its test support capability.  Consequently, RTS has a continuing need for MSS to collect, process, and  interpret meteorological data; provide specialized weather forecasts; provide meteorological consultation services; provide operation and maintenance of meteorological equipment and instrumentation; provide systems engineering and integration; and improve ment and modernization.  Additionally, the contractor is expected to perform the normal duties of a weather forecast office and meteorological observatory.  Routine public service, aviation, and marine forecasts are issued and weather warnings and advisori es are disseminated as required.  The required MSS effort is provided near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), in an extremely corrosive marine environment (i.e., salt spray and periods of heavy rainfall).  The contractor may be required to provide MSS on a campaign basis at remote locations outside Kwajalein Atoll, such as Wake Island and Aur Atoll in the RMI, as necessary to support KMR customer requirements.   The contractor is expected to operate, and/or analyze/interpret data from, the following meteorological systems and instrumentation: Environmental Satellite Systems: Man-Computer Interactive Data Access System (McIDAS), suite of applications for analysis and visualization of complex meteorological data sets including satellite, radar, numerical model, and conventional observation data; CineSat, turnkey satellite analys is and forecast system provides real-time weather products including short-term predicted satellite images, cloud development maps, trajectories that predict the future movement of clouds, and positions, descriptions and predicted trajectories of convectiv e cloud cells; Meteorological Data Station AN/UMQ-13 (Mark IVB) to provide backup to the on-site readout imagery; Geostationary Satellite Data provides coverage reaching from the CONUS to the western Pacific; Polar-orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES) d ata to include cloud heights, total ozone estimates, and atmospheric sounding retrievals. Weather Radar Systems:  Kwajalein Polarimetric Radar (KPOL), Dual Polarized, Doppler S-Band Radar to detect, analyze and record precipitating weather systems; ALCOR/TRADEX Weather Scans to provide reflectivity from ALCOR/TRADEX radars. Upper Air Measurements:  Meteorological Sounding System (MSS), auto-tracking telemetry system with ranging capability; International Meteorological Systems (IMET) Upper-air Sounding System to determine altitude, wind direction and speed;  Radiotheodolite s ystem to provide wind data; Pilot Balloon (PIBAL) Observations to obtain low-level wind data; Meteorological Rocket and Robin Sphere Observations to provide meteorological data at altitudes higher than 100,000 feet. Conventional Ground Measurements: 3-cup rotor anemometer and spread-tail wind direction vane to perform wind measurements, H1063 Hygrothermometer to measure temperature, dew point, and relative humidity; Coastal Environmental Systems Precision Digital Baro meter to measure surface pressure; rain gauges to measure precipitation; laser ceilometer to measure cloud height, cloud ceiling, and horizontal visibility. Special Measuring Systems: IMPACT ESP lightening detectors to provide early warning of electrical storms over the entire atoll; acoustic tide gauge to measure sea water level. Additional acquisition information, as well as the RFP, when released, will be available at the USASMDC website, HYPERLINK http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/Contracts.html.  NO PAPER COPIES OF THE RFP WILL BE PROVIDED NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINE D FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS THE RFP WILL BE POSTED ON THE ABOVE WEBSITE ADDRESS.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Construction Services - The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for construction services for the complete demolition and build-out of office space on the 29th floor of the A.J. Celebrezze Federal Building located on 1240 E. Ninth St. in Cleveland, Ohio. The work on the 29th floor includes build out of a new elevator lobby and public corridor, upgrades to the fire life safety systems and installation of a new HVAC system. Also included in this project is the renovation of public restrooms on approximately ten floors throughout the building. The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $1.0 million to $5.0 million, with an anticipated project duration of approximately fourteen (14) months. The construction portion of the project is estimated to begin April  2006. 


A qualified contractor will be selected using a Two-step, No-go “Low Price Technically Acceptable” (LPTA) source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR.  Moreover, this will be a lump sum, fixed-price contract not set aside for small businesses. During step one of the Two-step LPTA, offers will be evaluated against the Go/No-go qualification factors.  Proposals found to be acceptable will then move on to step two of the evaluation process, during which price proposals will be opened and evaluated.  It is the Government’s intention to award the project to the lowest-priced bidder.  The bidder must also meet the Government’s standards of responsiveness and responsibility.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if it is in its best interest to do so.

All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. The contractor will be required to correct all deficiencies identified by the Government (or in its own quality control review) relating to the completeness or accuracy of the work, compliance with the contract, and compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.  The services procured under this contract will conform to the quality requirements in the specification.  Any Government furnished information relating to this acquisition will be distributed to parties after an award.  After an award, quality control will also include inspection, acceptance, warranty and other measures associated with quality requirements.  The contractor is not required to provide data or service for any of the systems that will be installed during this project.  Only typical inspection, training, acceptance, warranty and other requirements normally associated with our standard construction contracts will apply.  

Small Business Participation: This is a procurement open to both large and small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $28.5 million. Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small firms including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, and service disabled veteran-owned business are strongly encouraged to participate in this project. In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract. Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA). An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement. However, all firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local business participation. Contractors will submit a written narrative (limited to one typed written page) along with their offers that outlines their outreach efforts made to utilize local firms. In order to receive the benefit of a price evaluation preference as a HUBZone small business concern, firms must be certified by the SBA. Please refer to the SBA website at www.sba.gov for details.

Joint Ventures: Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CMc team effort.

Proposal Submission Requirements: The solicitation package will only be available electronically. It will be available on or about January 13, 2006. The solicitation will not be available on the Fedbizopps website. Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information.

This solicitation is being advertised on an UNRESTRICTED basis using full and open competitive procedures. The proposed contract will be a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. The requirement will contain provisions for three (3) base years, plus three (3) one-year options. Performance is expected to begin on or about June 1, 2006.

The Government intends to issue the solicitation on the WEB only. No paper copies or CDs will be issued.

The closing date of this solicitation will be early March 2006, unless otherwise noted. It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). 

Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award, located at http://www.ccr.gov. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all Offerors; to award the contract to other than the Offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the Offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government. The Government intends to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.

7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:		USAID/CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	BACKGROUND

USAID/CAR Background: Central Asia borders Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its location amidst these neighbors and its substantial oil and gas reserves, Central Asia is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 55 million and dozens of ethnic groups the five new nations of the region are emerging from isolation and almost two centuries of Russian domination. A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions makes Central Asia a particular challenge for USAID.  

The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. ambassadors in the region, for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics.  The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek and Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  The U.S. Government’s program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources; and improved primary healthcare.  It ranks as one of the Agency’s largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $139 million annually.  The Mission works in partnership with over 80 grantee and contractor teams.  USAID/CAR’s assistance seeks to mitigate conflict and expand opportunities for participation, livelihood and quality of life for the citizens of the Central Asian Republics.  Staff frequently travels to each of the five countries to manage and monitor development assistance. 
 
USAID/CAR has program responsibility for the formulation of assistance strategy and management approaches to support reforms in the energy systems of five countries in this region.  A major component of the CAR energy programs focuses on market development and regional cooperation in sharing of water and energy resources.  The majority of the current work is related to the power sector, and involves cross-border hydro-power resources and operation of large grids.

After relative isolation and stagnation in the 1990s, this sector has begun to attract significant foreign investments to develop and access vast energy resources for supplying the outside markets.  In addition, Kazakhstan has undergoing substantial reforms and privatization, and is experiencing rapid growth.  These trends offer opportunities to modernize this sector by developing internal and external markets, and by integrating with larger outside grids.  Increased commercialization and market developments are expected to expand trade and investments, while promoting transparency, governance, rule of law and checking corruption.

Based in USAID/Almaty, the Energy Policy Advisor will lead in the design, implementation, and coordination of USAID financed activities in CAR dealing with energy policy and market reforms.  The purpose of this work is to prepare the CAR systems for closer cooperation, support a framework for operation and development of cross-border water and energy resources, and to improve the performance of this sector.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address US Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management (C-E LCMC) Command, Acquisition Center, ATTN: AMSEL-AC-CB-RT-AB, Building 1208, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5008 Description MARKET SURVEY Solicitation Number W15P7T-06-R-J201     Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) Radios, Spares, and Engineering Services   The Government has identified a requirement to purchase increased quantities of the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) currently being procured under the SINCGARS Omnibus Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J101. Additional quantities of SI NCGARS are required to meet backorders, increased surge demands for war requirements, and a significant increase in the requirements for new SINCGARS to support the Modular Force reorganization of the Army. Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J101 was awarded on a competitive basis to ITT Industries, Aerospace/Communications Division (ITT), 1919 W. Cook Road, Ft. Wayne, IN 46801 on November 30, 2004 for the manufacture of the ITT designed SINCGARS assemblies RT 1523 ( ), AM-7239 ( ), AM-7238 ( ), RT-1477, RT 1478D and spare parts.   This contract is a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and Time and Materials (T&M), Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract, with a five-year base period and two option years to procure SINCGARS, spare parts and sustainment support for the ITT family of SINCG ARS.  The contract also requires delivery of an Export Version of the SINCGARS, based on RT-1523E, for Foreign Military Sales customers.  A Technical Data Package (TDP) for the Export Version of the SINCGARS is not available. The Government is currently pursuing an effort to expand the capability of the SINCGARS configuration to add a second channel radio titled the SINCGARS Sidehat, capable of running a SCA 2.2 compliant Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) or Enhanced Position Locati on Reporting System (EPLRS) waveform (operator selectable), to provide the dismounted soldier connectivity to the Tactical Internet.  The Sidehat is an ITT proprietary design at this time.  The intent is to provide the capability as a constructive engineer ing change to the existing SINCGARS configuration and produce this hardware on this contract since the SIDEHAT requires power and Man Machine Interfaces from the SINCGARS radio to operate.  The SINCGARS Receiver Transmitter has been redesigned to provide t he hooks to support this initiative.  The Government is seeking interest from alternate sources capable of producing a build to print version of these configurations at a rate of 6,000 radios per month.  This contract includes support of all generations of ITT manufactured SINCGARS to include the Integrated Communications (ICOM) Security RT-1523, 1523B, RT-1476, RT-1477, RT-1478, System Improvement Program (SIP) RT-1523C, and Advanced System Improvement Pr ogram (ASIP) RT-1523E and RT-1478D.  The contract includes provisions for an Obsolescence Internal Risk Reserve Fund to address major obsolescence issues.  To maximize the flexibility in modernization of the older assemblies, configuration control of the S INCGARS configurations under this contract has been reassigned to ITT to support this ongoing redesign effort resulting in new drawings that have not been delivered to the Government.  Consequently, the Technical Data Package (TDP) which supports the manuf acture of these assemblies has become unstable because the redesigns are ongoing and drawings are not yet delivered to the Government for these redesigned configurations.  Since the initiation of this contract, the Governments requirement for SINCGARS has  increased from a quantity of 245,000 Ground and 9,345 Airborne radios to 472,564 Ground and 12,500 Airborne radios. This requires the Government to increase the contract ceiling on the existing production contract to support the procurement of the additio nal required radios. The Government is seeking to identify sources with the capabi lity to produce this radio and associated spare parts over the next 3-5 years.  Interested sources must demonstrate that they have the plant capacity to meet monthly demands of up to 6,000 SINCGARS Line Replaceable Units, and additional spares requirements  that equate to approximately 500 Receiver Transmitters per month.  Deliveries must begin within 9 months of contract award to include completion of First Article Testing (FAT) to satisfy the Armys accelerated fielding schedules. FAT to qualify the produc tion line will be required for all sources, other than ITT, that are interested in the proposed action. Any source interested in the proposed action will be required to produce the existing version of SINCGARS configurations. Due to the significant impact of an alternate designed product on the Logistics training and support system which would be introduced by a different design, the Government requires that the product produced under this effort be a build to print effort. Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J101 also includes requirements for services, to include the repair of all hardware and ancillary items listed under the contract and hardware acquired under the contract.  Engineering support services are required to be perform ed throughout the length of the contract for efforts related to supportability analysis, development, manufacturing, and testing and fielding of SINCGARS items delivered under this contract.  Selected engineering tasks include, but are not limited to:  1) The evaluation of the maintenance concept to ensure the most cost-effective sparing options are maintained on elected models or assemblies affected by obsolete components 2) The update of field maintenance procedures as required, to include organizational level as well as the AN/GRM software and technical documentation support., are required to be performed and 3) Production of the Sidehat (SRW) waveform accessory item. Contractor Field Service Representative (CFSR) support of all system installations, training and field support of all SINCGARS equipment is also required to be performed under this contract.  SINCGARS training support services and material are required to be provided.  The CFSR support will include the responsibility to conduct   in-country site surveys, installation kit development and spare parts packages and engineering support to resolve field identified technical issues with the SINCGARS radio system.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to meet the Governments requirements.  Sources capable of providing these items in accordance with the Governments requirements, to include the required delivery schedule shall respond in wri ting.  The response should be a short introductory description (unclassified) outlining a viable approach that meets the above needs and should address production capabilities.  Responses from interested sources shall address their capability to act as a s ingle provider for the SINCGARS, spares, and services.

<SUBJECT>B -- Global Positioning System (GPS) Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) Generation Two Thermal Spray Kit Evaluation Development
<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) intends to contract with NSA-certified Thermal Spray coating vendors to test and evaluate the Generation Two Thermal Spray powder kit formulation developed by the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office (JPO).  This task supports the Government effort to develop a second generation Thermal Spray kit formulation which will replace the current formulation.  This task also supports the development of advancements to the GPS Thermal Spray technology at coating vendor facilities; the increased testability of the Thermal Spray coating application process; and the improvement of process control at the Thermal Spray coating vendor facilities by developing quality control monitoring techniques.  
White Electronic Designs Corp., Rockwell Collins, Inc., and Teledyne Electronic Technologies, as the only three vendors currently certified by the NSA to apply the Thermal Spray coating to SAASMs, are uniquely qualified to conduct this effort in timely, cost effective and efficient manner.  It is impractical to consider use of available funding to develop new vendors because NSA certification as a GPS Thermal Spray vendor can take a number of years, requires special expertise gained through years of experience with qualified classified materials, and requires Thermal Spray equipment valued at over $1 million.  White Electronic Designs Corp., Rockwell Collins, Inc., and Teledyne Electronic Technologies are currently NSA certified for use of first-generation Thermal Spray kit, have the requisite experience and maintain the necessary Thermal Spray equipment.  SMC intends to award this contract on or before 25 June 2006.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to award this effort to White Electronic Designs Corp., Rockwell Collins, Inc. and Teledyne Electronic Technologies and shall not be considered a request for offers.  This is a sole source effort to be awarded to White Electronic Designs Corp., Rockwell Collins, Inc. and Teledyne Electronic Technologies.

<SUBJECT>D -- Sole Source Notice
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) currently has a contract (0600-00-40649) with MCI Communications, Inc. (d.b.a. Verizon Business Services) for automatic call distributing services in support of the SSA’s national 800 number. This contract is referred to the as Call Center Network Services contract (CCNS). CCNS provides the capability for SSA employee representatives at 37 teleservice sites to answer and manage approximately 60,000,000 yearly telephone calls from SSA’s National 800 Number Network (N8NN).  Automatic call distribution (ACD) systems located at eight Verizon Business locations across the country contain the hardware which controls the CCNS telephone sets and provides the interface to the router. The call answering infrastructure is comprised of a network router which maintains an awareness of the state of all 10,295 SSA answering positions.   The functionality of the CCNS system includes a forecasting and scheduling tool to plan for the proper staffing of the call centers in accordance with the call traffic, proprietary software for delivering enhanced desktop capabilities for SSA employees with disabilities, CCNS specific Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) applications and voice recognition functionality, and custom management information reporting capabilities on both site and enterprise basses.  This contract expires August 19, 2008. This notice is to advise that the SSA intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, for potential continued performance of these CCNS services for a period not to exceed two (2) additional option years beginning August 20, 2008, and ending August 19, 2010. This sole source contract extension is authorized under FAR 6-302-1, “only one responsible source, and no other services will satisfy the agency requirements”. The contract extension is required to: 1) allow the SSA to finalize the re-procurement activity of call center distribution services, 2) allow the SSA to complete and implement the ongoing Telephone Systems Replacement Project using voice over internet protocol technologies (see SSA-RFP-06-1031), and 3) allow the General Services Administration to complete their transition from the FTS2001 contract to the Networx contract.  The current CCNS contract, its follow on contract, and prospective SSA TSRP contract all rely, or will rely, upon services provisioned under FTS2001 and/or Networx. Until Networx and SSA’s TSRP are implemented, re-competition of the CCNS contract is determined to place unacceptable risk to SSA’s voice communication networks that are critical to achieving the SSA’s mission.  The SSA cannot perform its mission without ongoing, uninterrupted provision of these services, nor can it tolerate any disruption to its constituent beneficiaries. The incumbent contractor is in place, operational and able to provide the services during this interim period with full system implementation without interruption and degradation. This contract extension is necessary to allow sufficient time to implement transition/closedown and phase out the existing contracts. The SSA will re-compete the CCNS contract no later than the expiration of the final option period (August 19, 2010).

If necessary, the Contractor will be provided with a radio at this time.  The Contractor shall return the radio at the end of the work.  The Contractor shall also receive airfield passes for his vehicles at this time.

4.	The removal of rubber shall be accomplished by using a runway derubberizing compound specifically formulated and field-tested for this purpose.  Any compound that is not exclusively designed for rubber removal will not be acceptable.  Any techniques which involve scraping or high-pressure water blasting will not be allowed.  All work shall be in strict accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.   

5.	The Contractor shall submit the following information to the Contract Administrator:

·	Detailed documentation indicating that the Contractor has successfully removed runway rubber buildup for at least 30 major airports throughout the country or overseas.  If requested, the Contractor shall be prepared to provide references at these specific airports.

6.	The equipment used for rubber removal work shall be mounted on pneumatic tires, and shall not cause damage to the pavement surface or joints.
 
7.	The Contractor shall provide lighting as required.

8.	The Contractor shall begin work only when the air temperature is 40º F and rising, and when the pavement temperature is 35º F and rising.  

9.	The Contractor shall erect highly visible cones and barricades around the work area as appropriate.

10.	Water will be provided to the Contractor at no cost.  The water source will be a fire hydrant(s) located within the airfield area.

14.	Compliance with the 85-percent removal from 100-percent of the work area shall be determined by direct testing within the designated work area.

14.1	A one square foot section of transparent material inscribed with a grid of 100 equal squares shall be used as a tool for quantitative measure of the 85-percent removal.  Place the grid pattern on the pavement surface at random locations.  Then count the squares which contain rubber deposits.  The number of squares containing rubber deposits shall not exceed 15 in each of the randomly selected locations.

14.2	Each work area designated for rubber removal shall be divided into four equal zones for the purpose of compliance testing.  Within each zone, a minimum of seven random locations shall be evaluated.  At least 85-percent of the randomly selected areas within each zone must meet the requirement described in paragraph 14.1.  Each zone shall be evaluated independently.  A zone not meeting the 85-percent removal requirement shall be recleaned by the Contractor at the Contractor’s expense.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a  Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

This combined synopsis notice constitutes the only Request For Proposal (RFP) and a written RFP will not be issued. This notice is hereby issued as RFP No. NAAN6000601311RFA. This is an unrestricted solicitation with full and open competition. This RFP and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09.  Signed and dated proposals must be submitted to the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Central Region Acquisition Division, Attn: Ron Anielak, 601 East 12th Street, Rm.1756, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

A. Statement of Work / Specifications

A.1.  Introduction:

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill AFB, Florida, operates a fleet of four heavy aircraft, all of which require a high altitude radar altimeter system to complete mission requirements.

A.2.  Requirements:	

This acquisition is for a replacement radar altimeter system which meets the following minimum requirements: Honeywell International, Model HG9550 LPI Radar Altimeter, model No.HG9550AD01 or equal with the following salient characteristics:
a)Unit must be an off the shelf, current production model, commercial item of modern low weight and low power design, high accuracy, qualified for use in US military aircraft.  This requirement is driven by the extreme turbulence encountered by the NOAA/AOC WP-3 aircraft during a number of mission profiles, including Hurricane research.
b)Light weight less than 10 pounds
c)Unit must be completely compatible and interface to a current production radar height indicator capable of displaying altitude from 0 ft up to 50,000 ft.  NOAA/AOC has an existing inventory of at least 7 high altitude radar height indicators, Moog model 85000000-02.  
d)Unit must be plug and play compatible with the existing NOAA/AOC APN-232 radar altimeter receiver transmitter.  Due to the high cost of aircraft modification, only units which are compatible with the existing radar altimeter wiring and mounts will be considered.
e)Unit must be a “low power” radar altimeter, with a peak transmit power not to exceed 1 watt.  This requirement is needed because the NOAA/AOC aircraft operate with a wide variety of sensitive research equipment onboard, the operation of which may be degraded by an unnecessarily strong signal transmitted by the radar altimeter.
f)The unit shall operate in a frequency band allocated by the FCC for aeronautical radio navigation. Minimum transmit frequency shall be 4.2 GHz.  NOAA/AOC aircraft operate with a wide variety of sensitive equipment on board, and the higher the radar altimeter transmit frequency, the less likely there will be conflicts with research instrumentation.
g)The unit shall operate with a minimum band width, not to exceed 200MHZ.  NOAA/AOC aircraft operate with a wide variety of sensitive equipment on board, and the narrower the radar altimeter bandwidth, the less likely there will be conflicts with research instrumentation. 	

A.3.  Required Delivery Date: Item 01 – 10 months after receipt of order; Item 02 - option item shall be exercised within 180 calendar days from contract award and be required for delivery no later than 10 months after Government’s exercise of option. 

B.  Evaluation:
The evaluation of proposals shall be based on the Offeror’s responsiveness to the items and requirements listed in Section A and Offeror’s price proposal.

Specifications for the Purchase of a Microwave Plasma Ashing System for the CNST Nanofab

Background:

The CNST Nanofab requires a Microwave Plasma Ashing system to provide damage-free removal of organic materials such as photoresist from the surface of substrates. The current process used in the Nanofab at NIST is to remove the material and residue by hand. This is time consuming and dangerous when using “Nanostrip”, EKC265, RCA, or other caustic chemicals. The Microwave Plasma Ashing system reduces the chemical use and the associated dangers, while allowing up to 25 wafers to be cleaned in less than 30 minutes. 

Specifications:

•	The unit must be capable of:
o	Photoresist Strip (Including difficult implanted and very thick
resists such as Microchem SU-8.)
o	Removal of Polymers such as Polyimide, PMMA, etc.
o	Photoresist Descum Removal.
o	Meeting Very Low Temperature Budget removal Requirements.
o	Metal Lift off Process Improvement.
o	Wafer Surface Cleaning.
o	Surface Modification for hydrophobic or hydrophilic and Stiction

<DESC>1.  The SOW requires the contractor to &provide on-site medical evacuation&. To which medical facility/facilities does the government intend for the contractor to evacuate patients? Answer:  St. Mary Corwin (Pueblo) or Evans Army Community Hospital (Fort Carson) 2.  The government states The Fort Carson Installation Aviation office will establish a rotation between civilian contract services and military MEDEVAC. Minimum utilization and subsequent compensation requirements are anticipated. In another section, th e government states This posture will be maintained for the duration of the designated shift timeframe. And in another section, the SOW says The aircrews and aircraft must be staged at the PCMS to provide 24/7 coverage.  These statements seem to be contradictory. Is the contractor required to provide MEDEVAC coverage 24/7 from 1 June through 16 June continuously or will there be periods of time the contractor will not be required (&rotation between civilian contract servic es and military MEDEVAC&? Please explain. Answer:  Contractor will provide 24/7 coveraged during the performance period.  Military MEDEVAC will assume responsibility after contractor performance period expires. 3.  The government states it &will provide the contractor an improved facility for the purpose of crew rest and flight planning including latrine facilities.  Does this improved facility have potable running water (water fountains, sinks, showers, etc.)?    Does it include a refrigerator to store perishable medical supplies or will the contractor need to provide a refrigerator?  Does it include a secure area to store controlled substances (narcotics and specialized medical items) or will the contractor nee d to find another method of securing these items? Answer:  Yes, a secure area within the pharmacy section of the TMC. 4.  Is there an area at PCMS which the contractor can use for disposal of biohazards (body fluids, tissue, etc.) if necessary? Answer:  No.  There are no facility where biohazards can be disposed of. 5.  The solicitation has no specific requirements for the submission of cost, is this to be included in the 50 page maximum?  Answer:  Conform the price proposal with single CLIN provided.  The price proposal will not count against the 50 page limit for the technical proposal. 6.  If cost is to be separated from the technical proposal what format and level of detail is required?  Answer:  Not relevant to this requirement. 7.  FAR clauses which support option to extend services (52.217-9 and 52.217-8) are not included in the solicitation; is it safe to assume that the government does not anticipate extension of this effort past the two week period of performance? Answer:  There is no intent to extend performance.  In the event the exercise runs beyond the end of the performance period military MEDEVAC assets will relieve the contractor. 8. Are there any specific security requirements which must be met prior to performance (i.e. background checks, employee clearances, CAC cards, etc)? Answer:  No.
