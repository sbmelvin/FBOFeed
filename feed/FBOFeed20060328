The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source bridge contract with the Eagle Research Group, Inc. The proposed bridge contract will provide continuous support to assist the Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance (SSA), formerly the Office of Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance, in providing the Secretary of Energy and Senior DOE managers with an independent assessment of the effectiveness of DOE policies and DOE site performance in the areas of safeguards, security, emergency management, and other critical functions.  These services are currently being performed by Eagle Research Group, Inc., Inc. under Department of Energy Contract Number DE-AC01-00OA00005, which will expire on May 16, 2006. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 USC 2304[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirements. Eagle Research Group, Inc., possesses the requisite highly specialized technical expertise and capabilities required to perform the Statement of Work, along with the required security clearances and qualified personnel. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firm's ability to provide the services, as described above.  A copy of the Statement of Work and Position Qualifications are available from the Internet via the "Industry Interactive Procurement System (UPS)" home page located at Internet address: http://e-center.doe.gov/.  Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within fifteen (15) days of this notice to: Mr. Barry Page, MA-642.2, 1000 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC 20505, or via e-mail to barry.page@hq.doe.gov  A determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The intent of this award is to provide the required support services until the award and transition of a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541690. The period of performance is for a total of twelve months, consisting of one 6-month base period and two 3-month option periods. ***See Numbered Note 22

<DESC>The Western Area Power Administration, Upper Great Plains Region, North Dakota Maintenance Office intends to issue a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to TransTel Group Inc under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The requirement is for stationary cellular phone packages and upgrades for existing stationary cellular phone packages. Presently we have Trans Tel Group, INC analog phones (RTS-100-N3R) at ninety-one remote metering sites. Western Area Power Administration will upgrade all of these sites in the next 3 years as their Maintenance Schedule and budget dollars allow.  We can upgrade these units and have direct replacement units.  This will reduce the cost for installation (no new wiring will be required) and using the same style of equipment will reduce errors resulting in less time for installation.  Plus upgarding as many units as possible saves Western Area Power Administration $170.00 per unit compared to purchasing a different style of unit from a different manufacture. This would increase Western Area Power Administration's errors and installation time. The solicitation will be issued electronically on or about March 29, 2006 at http://e-center.doe.gov/  as a 100% small business set-aside. This notice is not a request for proposals/quotes.  However interested parties may identify their interest and capabilty to satisfy the Government's requirements by emailing or faxing the Contract Specialist at 701-221-4526. Capabilty statements must include documentation ability to satisfy the Government's requirements. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Detachment 12, Space Test Program (STP) Office, Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM, is contemplating the award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for one or more small space vehicles to fly future space experiments. The scope of the IDIQ contract will be an initial order of one (1), and a maximum order of six (6), space vehicles over the life of the contract. Other space hardware such as separation devices, adapters, and miscellaneous launch/space support hardware, will be included in the scope of the contract. This will be a 6-year contract with an initial order for one spacecraft, integration & testing of one or more experiments onto the spacecraft, launch site preparation of the space vehicle, anomaly resolution and data trending for at least one year of  on-orbit operations. The space vehicle will be designed to fly a range of low earth orbits within a range of inclinations with a minimum one-year lifetime as described in the Technical Requirements Document. Other delivery orders are anticipated (up to a maximum of 5 additional) but are not part of the initial order. The purpose/goal of this program will be to design, fabricate, integrate, and test a spacecraft with a standard interface to the experiments so that future spacecraft would require minimum redesign. This acquisition will be procured using Full and Open procedures. STP has begun an incremental release of a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP), SOO and all subsequent documents on the STP-SIV (ESPA Class) Website, http://www.smc.kirtland.af.mil/stp-siv.html. Interested Offerors are asked to submit a written letter of intent (or email) no later than (see Block 4) to Mr.Chris Milburn, 3548 Aberdeen Ave SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5776.  Industry comments to the DRFP and SOO are encouraged and should be submitted no later than 26 April 05.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. If discussions are to be conducted, a competitive range may be established which will be comprised of all the most highly rated proposals unless further reduced for purposes of efficiency.  For this proposed acquisition, and using the small business size standard for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 336414, the size standard of 1,000 employees apply. Potential Offerors are advised that work to be performed will require up to a Top Secret/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability.  Adequate key personnel shall be cleared to perform at the Secret level at time of award.  There shall be a capability in place not later than 18 months after contract award for TS/SCI facilities and TS/SCI cleared personnel. Space Vehicle requirements will be provided on the website and in the RFP technical requirements document (TRD). Potential offerors will be required to develop a realistic standard spacecraft to payload (experiments) interface as part of their proposal. In addition, requirements for the first experiment will be provided, upon request, to U.S. Government Prime Contractors. Proposals will be required to demonstrate the offerors design approach as it applies to the payload for the initial delivery order. Background: STP requires multiple small spacecraft to fly future space experiments. For the Initial Space Vehicle and Any Additional Space Vehicle Required Thereafter: The contractor will design, fabricate, integrate and test the spacecraft, plus integrate and test one or more experiments to the spacecraft, launch site preparation of the space vehicle, and anomaly resolution during on-orbit operations. The government will provide the experiments and the launch. All replies to this synopsis must refer to the STP-SIV (ESPA Class) acquisition. Submit only unclassified information. Initial award of any resultant contract is anticipated in late fall of 2005. Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Contracts will be awarded only to U.S. companies. Foreign nationals are not allowed to participate on this program. Foreign vendors providing non-technical services (e.g., a separation device) to the prime U.S. contractor must be pre-approved by SMC Det 12/ST PCO. The research and test data produced under a resultant contract may contain Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) information whose export is restricted by the Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S. Sec 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401, et seq.). Only those companies who are on the Qualified Contractors Access List (QCAL) may receive such information. Request certification and registration from the Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC), Federal Center, 74 North Washington, Battle Creek, MI 49016-3412 as soon as possible.

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential Offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential Offerors when an Offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain Offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an Offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of 12 new Transportable SATCOM Ground Terminals (TSGT), including 9 full terminals and 3 support rigs, and the upgrade of 7 Tri-band TSGTs in the NATO inventory. These projects are included in Project serial 2003/0CM03018-0 under CP 0A0149 for the procurement of SATCOM Communications System Capabilities, that include the procurement of 12 TSGTs and Project serial 2003/0CM03034-0 under CP 5A0030 for the upgrade of the 7 second generation TSGTs.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the Infrastructure Committee.  The rough cost estimate of the project is 22.85 million EUR ($27.5 million USD) for the procurement of 12 TSGTs and 3.54 million EUR ($4.3 million USD) for the upgrade of the 7 TSGTs. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) is IFB-CO-11790-TSGT. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Both projects are expected to be completed in 18 months from the Effective Date of Contract (EDC). The Invitation for Bids (IFB) will be structured in 2 portions reflecting the procurement of new TSGTs and the upgrade of the NATO-owned tri-band TSGTs. The Bidders will be allowed to choose whether to bid for only one or for both portions. The two portions will be evaluated and awarded separately.

The competitive bidding is limited to companies experienced with the provision of similar types of systems; in addition, the bidders will be required to submit with their bid a Certificate of Conformity (COC) in accordance with STANAG 4107 for the qualified Terminal (TSGT) that they will propose for the new TSGT project. 

The envisaged method of bidding for both portions will be the One Envelope Procedure in which the Price Proposals are opened and evaluated and the bids ranked in order by lowest price. Technical Evaluation then commences with the lowest price bid until a fully compliant bid is found.

ELIGIBILITY

Interested firms must be nominated by their National Authorities with the required Declaration of Eligibility. REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED.

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a Bid Guarantee of 200,000 EUR for the first portion (procurement of TSGTs) and 100,000 EUR for the second portion (upgrade). Should the selection and award procedure exceed the 12 month after Bid Closing Date, firms will be requested to voluntarily extend the validity of their bids and Bid Guarantee accordingly. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

National authorities are advised that the ICB package, including technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO UNCLASSIFIED. If classified material will have to be included in the ICB package or in the Bidders response to the IFB, the transmission of it shall be processed through their respective National Delegation/Mission to NATO.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Embassy in Brussels to submit a Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) on your behalf: 1 November 2005.

2. Anticipated date that the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB/IFB) will be forwarded to those on the Bidder List (distribution of the Cahier des Charges): End of December 2005

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: April 2006 (at least 84 days after issue of IFB)

4. Anticipated contract award date: September 2006

CERTIFICATION

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SERVE AS THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR NATO PROJECTS. HOWEVER, ALL FIRMS WHOSE FACILITY IS LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO BID FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and award to Veraxx Engineering Corporation (Veraxx),14221, Willard Road, Suite 200, Chantilly VA 20151, a contract for completion of developmental software changes in the network component of the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Tactical Environment Network (TEN), completion of development of the Network Immersing Cockpit Learning Environment (NICLE), and delivery of final developmental software and hardware technical data and documentation for the USMC TEN and NICLE. The anticipated date for award is 01 May 2006. Delivery shall be 150 days after receipt of order. This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).

A solicitation will be issued on or about 10 April 2006. This procurement will result in a FFP contract. See numbered note 22 (substitute fifteen for forty five days). Response may be made by email to: Patricia.Schaub@navy.mil or the address above. For information regarding this procurement, contact: Patricia Schaub at 407-380-8065 .

It is the Government’s intention to issue this solicitation exclusively through the Internet at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.  The entire solicitation will be available at the site for viewing or downloading.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register at the web site.  This will normally be the only method of distribution of amendments, therefore it is the offeror’s responsibility to periodically check the web site for amendments to the solicitation.  The official plan holder list will also be maintained on and can be printed from the web site.  Offerors MUST also be registered in the Contractor’s Central Registration (CCR) in order to participate in this procurement.  The website for the CCR is http://www.ccr2000.com.  Technical inquiries must be submitted in writing 15 days before proposals are due to the address listed above, or fax to 843-820-5819, Attn:  Sandy, Mulligan, Code OPT2AC-SM.  The Contractor shall provide services to complete renovation of Bldg. 585, MAG-31 HQ aboard the Beaufort Marine Corps Air Station, Beaufort, South Carolina and consists of the following:

a.	Complete renovation of existing administrative areas by providing new office floor plan, secure area with vault, and restrooms/locker rooms.   
b.        	New standing seam metal roof with associated supporting metal roof structure.
c.	Seismic upgrade of exterior and interior masonry walls.
d.         New mechanical and electrical systems throughout the facility.

Existing Conditions

Building 585 is the current MAG-31 Headquarters facility located at the Marine Corps Air Station, Beaufort, SC consisting of a single-story, concrete structure with 8” masonry infill, steel bar joists, and a lightweight concrete roof with mineral surfaced bitumen roof cover.  The existing exterior walls have an EIFS (exterior insulated finish system).  Asbestos containing materials and lead-based paint are present and will be abated during the renovation.

Demolition

The following building components will be demolished:  select exterior windows and doors, interior partitions, existing restrooms, select mechanical/electrical systems, and various obstructions on interior and exterior wall faces in preparation for new finishes.    Select building CMU walls/EIFS will also be cut/sliced at approximately 32” spacing to facilitate reinforcement/seismic upgrade efforts.

Architectural

The building will utilize the existing exterior walls and existing concrete floor.  The exterior wall openings where demolished windows and doors existed will be in filled with reinforced masonry.  New office and corridor walls will consist of steel stud walls with gypsum wallboard on each side.  The interior side of all exterior walls will be furred and gypsum wallboard installed.  New exterior doors will be steel and new interior doors will be wood, both hung in steel frames.  A secure area will be added with steel mesh wall reinforcement under the gypsum board on both sides of the metal studs. A vault will be provided within the secure area constructed of 8” thick reinforced concrete and CMU.  The existing flat roof will be covered with a new standing seam metal roof consisting of a metal roof truss system, bearing on the existing structure.  The existing EIFS on the exterior walls will be repaired and receive a new finish coat.  

Structural 

The building’s concrete masonry units (CMU) do not meet current seismic criteria.  Reinforcement will be incorporated into existing CMU wall sections and will tie into the existing foundation and bond beams.  A similar upgrade technique, which utilizes steel flat bar shapes and wall fasteners, will be employed where unreinforced grout filled CMU wall construction or similar construction is encountered.  Additional shear walls (CMU and steel framed with plywood skin) will be constructed where new construction is provided and where it can strengthen the structure.  The existing roof system will be “X” braced along each exterior wall.
The new standing seam metal roof system design will utilize a performance type specification with contract and referenced as-built drawings.

Mechanical 
The new floor plan will necessitate the addition of new above ceiling water-source heat pump units and air distribution systems.  The existing condenser water pump, piping to well field, DDC head-end controls, sanitary sewer system (in part), and the domestic water system (in part) will be reutilized.  New plumbing fixtures will include water closets, urinals, lavatories, showers, and mop sinks.

Electrical

The building is served with secondary delivery voltage of 120/208V, 3 Phase.  New panels, wiring, and light fixtures will be provided.  The existing communications system will be reused with new telephone/data outlets added as required.  A complete addressable, supervised fire alarm system will be installed.

The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the small business size standard is $31 Million.  The Federal Supply Code is Y199, ConstructMisc Bldgs.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with its own employees. The proposed solicitation will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  Offerors will be evaluated on the following technical factors:  Factor A Past Performance (Phase I submittal will be utilized); Factor B Small Business Subcontracting Effort; Factor C Technical Qualifications (same as Phase I); and Factor D Technical Solution.  Technical is considered to be significantly more important than price.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  THE SEED PROJECT WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN PHASE II.  Phase I will be issued on or about April 19, 2006, with a proposal due date on or about May 19, 2006.  

A two-phase selection procedure will be used.  Phase one shall include the scope of work, phase-one evaluation factors to include technical solution, technical qualifications, and past performance.  Phase two will require submission of technical and price proposals which will be evaluated separately.   

The contract will be for a term of five years consisting of one base year and four option years.  The estimated cost for this acquisition is between $55,000,000.00 and $60,000,000.00 for the five-year term of the contract.  Task orders will range from $100,000.00 to $3,000,000.00.

<CONTACT>Thomas Parenteau, Contracting Officer, Phone 850-452-4616 X3113, Fax 850-452-9398, Email thomas.parenteau@navy.mil
<DESC>Purpose:  The purpose of Phase I of this Solicitation is to select no more than ten (10) firms to participate in Phase II of the Solicitation process where the Government will select up to four proposals considered in the best interest of the Government using the best value continuum and tradeoff process in a negotiated acquisition for contract award.  

General Overview:  This procurement will result in the award of up to four (4) separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts for Roofing.  The project title is "Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for Roofing for the Pensacola Region”.  This procurement will be a single solicitation using a two-step process resulting in the award of four IDIQ MACC Contracts for a base and three option years, each with a minimum guarantee of $25,000.00, and not-to-exceed amount of $2,500,000.00 per year per contract.  The guaranteed minimum of $25,000.00 applies to the life of each contract.  The total not-to-exceed for the base and three option years for all four contracts is $40,000,000.00 ($10,000,000.00 per contract).  

Projects assigned to the IDIQ contracts will use the Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) approach to scope and price the work.  The requirement for construction schedules will be determined prior to the issuance of each task order.  The work will be ordered by individual task order on an "as needed as required basis".  Task orders may range in value from $2,000.00 to $1,500,000.00, with multiple simultaneous orders at various locations possible.  After award of the initial contract(s), contractors will compete for task orders based on a best value, low price or low price technically acceptable to the Government basis.  Construction schedules will be determined prior to the issuance of each task order.  If a minimum of two offerors remain in the pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process.  

Small Business Set-Aside:  This overall procurement is being advertised on an unrestricted basis, with one contract reserved for award to a qualified 8(a) Small Business firm, and one contract reserved for award to a qualified HubZone Small Business firm, the remaining contracts will be awarded on an unrestricted basis using full and open competition.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 238160, Roofing Contractors, and the Size Standard is $13M.  The Government will include all applicable price evaluation preferences in its evaluation.  The seed project will be awarded on a "Best Value" basis, and subsequent task orders competed among the successful contractors.  

Phase I Proposal Evaluation:  Phase I of this procurement will result in a narrowing of offerors to approximately seven to ten firms based on technical evaluation factors that include:  Factor A – Past Performance, Factor B – Technical Qualifications & Experience, Factor C – Scheduling, and Factor D – Small Business Subcontracting Effort.  These Phase I factors relate to the base year and three option year IDIQ contract requirements for repair and/or replacement of the following roof systems and all associated work to include temporary roof repairs and dry-ins:  

BUILT-UP ROOF
MODIFIED BITUMEN ROOF
EPDM SINGLE-PLY ROOF	
ASPHALT SHINGLE ROOF
TILE ROOF
METAL ROOF
WATERPROOF ELASTOMERIC ROOF COATING

The seed project requirements and contract specs will be added by amendment at the conclusion of Phase I. 

Pre-Proposal Conference:  A non-mandatory pre-proposal conference is scheduled for 1:00 PM on Thursday 13 April 2006 at the main conference room of the NAVFAC ROICC Office, bldg. 746, 520 Turner St. NAS Pensacola, FL.  A site visit for the seed project will be scheduled for a later date.

<DESC>The Office of Federal Detention Trustee plans to solicit proposals from Small Business for the following requirement:

In September 2001, Congress directed the creation of the Office of Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) in response to growing concerns regarding the management of persons in federal detention.  Congress charged OFDT with the responsibility to provide for the safe, secure, and humane confinement of persons in federal custody awaiting trial or immigration proceedings.  To satisfy this mission, OFDT relies heavily on IT solutions that support targeted efficiencies in detention management.  OFDT seeks IT solutions that are cost effective, operations centric, leverage legacy systems when needed, and integrate knowledge sharing amongst participating detention agencies. 

In pursuit of its mission, OFDT recently introduced eDesignate.  eDesignate is a system that automates the designation process (i.e., that process that results in sentenced individuals being “designated” to a facility in which they will serve their sentence).  Currently OFDT has a robust production environment to support eDesignate.  

OFDT envisions eDesignate and related infrastructure to evolve into a more comprehensive IT system that will provide cross-organizational automation to several OFDT functions.  It is the desire of OFDT to eventually reach maturity with its infrastructure such that there are separate environments for testing, development, training, and production.   However, OFDT is constrained by current resource limitations that require it to first provide one environment  that meets all of these needs.

OFDT has identified a need to establish a development, testing, and training suite that meets OFDT’s current evaluation criteria.  

This project represents the logical maturation of OFDT system-of-systems that will, when fully realized, provide cross-organizational automation to several OFDT functions.  As previously stated, it is the desire of OFDT to eventually reach maturity with its infrastructure such that there are separate environments for testing, development, training and production. However, OFDT is constrained by current resource limitations that require it to first provide one environment that meets all of these needs. Because of future extensibility needs, the nature of this development/testing/training environment shall be such that OFDT can easily evolve it to separate environments.

The following is a brief synopsis of the DTCI requirement.  Specific DTCI requirements will be identified in Performance Work Statement to be included in the upcoming draft solicitation release.

DTCI is a CONUS transportation management initiative focused on increasing operational effectiveness while simultaneously obtaining efficiencies by reducing cycle times and using best practices, such as increased consolidations / load optimization and modal conversions.  The premise is for DoD to competitively award a long-term contract with a world-class transportation coordinator that will employ best commercial practices to achieve the goals stated above. The coordinator's scope goes beyond traditional freight forwarding and brokerage transactions.  The coordinator will leverage current commercial capabilities and proven best transportation practices of commercial shippers to manage, consolidate, and optimize specified CONUS freight movements using contractor-chosen modes among DoD shippers.  A multiple phased implementation approach is envisioned based on location and possibly functionality.  It is anticipated Phase I will begin with 18 Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) CONUS Defense Distribution Centers.  Phase II will include co-located service shippers within a specified radius to achieve maximum volume participation and corollary cost savings through consolidation and optimization of freight requirements. Phase III will include additional service shippers throughout CONUS. The DTCI coordinator must have visibility of targeted freight movement requirements across the CONUS and have immediate access to a nationwide network of transportation providers to schedule and fulfil those requirements.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Semiconductor Electronics Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI for scientific services to research and report on IEEE 1588 integration in semiconductor factory automation environments (including a base year and one option year).
 
To properly investigate the integration of time synchronization mechanisms such as IEEE 1588 - A precision clock synchronization protocol in networked measurement and control systems and to prototype software and hardware based on new industry timing standards requires a research-oriented factory environment tailored towards next-generation industry needs.  Integrating new time synchronization software, hardware, and protocols and understanding their performance and impact in an industrial factory requires an environment with networked manufacturing equipment, robotics, and a supplemental virtual factory.  In order for this research to benefit U.S. industries, the results obtained must be rapidly and effectively transferred from the research environment into the factory.  Therefore, the research environment must support real-time, multi-tiered network controls and diagnostic structures, as well as factory-wide open software and data warehouses that are being deployed in cutting-edge industrial manufacturing facilities.  

The University of Michigan Engineering Research Center for Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems “ERC-RMS” is the only factory that exists that can be successfully configured (through the use of new software and hardware modules) to integrate the new IEEE 1588 standard into an existing manufacturing environment and to study the performance of the new standard.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541690, and the size standard of $6.5 Million.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by April 7, 2006 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is seeking proposals to pre-qualify 8(a) firms for design-build projects at DOS Foreign Service posts worldwide.  Competition is restricted to eligible participants in the SBA’s 8(a) program.  The DOS anticipates award of up to four IDIQ contracts under which each firm will compete through a competitive proposal process for individual task orders.  The maximum of each task order is $7 million.  The maximum cumulative amount of the task orders issued under each contract in a single year is $20 million.  The IDIQ contracts will be issued for one base year and will include four one-year option periods that may be exercised by the Government.  Each contract will have a ceiling of $100 million for the base and all option years combined and a guaranteed minimum of $40,000 over the life of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make award of individual task orders estimated to be less than $3 million on a sole source basis to one of the contract awardees.  The award of individual task orders estimated to be greater than $3 million but less than or equal to $7 million will be competed between the firms chosen for award of the IDIQ contracts and selection will be based upon price and other factors stated in each request for task order proposal.  The competed task order awards will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror.  Although the IDIQ contracts will provide labor hour pricing for evaluation purposes, the task orders will be firm-fixed price.  The labor hour rates stated in the contract will be considered maximums.  At task order proposal time, offerors may propose a rate for a required labor category that is less than that listed in the contract, but the contract rates shall not be exceeded.  A specific period of performance will be established for each task order.  The scope of work (SOW) for task orders will include design-build construction services to provide new construction and/or renovation of existing buildings, facilities, structures, and building systems.  SOWs and specifications in task orders may also include site work and related structures to provide a complete, functional compound.  Task orders may include security improvements, new facilities, design/build construction, fire and life safety upgrades, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), to include chemical and biological filtration, energy conservation projects, electrical and mechanical system upgrades and similar work.  The types of design services may include, architecture and urban design; structural, civil, energy conservation, mechanical, electrical, seismic and geotechnical engineering, space planning and systems furniture integration, interior design, signage, technical and physical security, communication, RF shielding system design, blast protection design, fire protection engineering, potable water treatment and waste water treatment, landscaping design, cost estimating, scheduling, value engineering, and administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved.  The work must comply with either the applicable U.S. Government codes, regulations and standards, or the host country/city laws, codes and standards, whichever is more stringent.  Building design submission shall use hard metric units (Systems International).  Design submission phases will be identified in each task order and will typically include schematic design, design development (60%) submission, and construction document (100%) submission.  Design deliverables shall include construction drawings in AutoCAD, specifications, schedule of rates/bill of quantities, reports and calculations.  Construction services may include labor and materials to execute the OBO approved design; on-site organization with management of lines of authority to ensure overall project coordination; overall control throughout the life of the project.  Services include documentation submittals and institution of controlling programs such as:  quality control program, construction scheduling, cost control, and project close-out.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO)  is seeking proposals to pre-qualify Small Business firms for design-build projects at DOS Foreign Service posts worldwide.  Competition is restricted to eligible Small Business firms.  The DOS anticipates award of up to four IDIQ contracts under which each firm will compete through a competitive proposal process for individual task orders.  The range of the projects is from $3 million to a maximum of $10 million.  The maximum cumulative amount of the task orders issued under each contract in a single year is $20 million.  The IDIQ contracts will be issued for one base year and will include four one-year option periods that may be exercised by the Government.  Each contract will have a ceiling of $100 million for the base and all option years combined and a guaranteed minimum of $40,000 over the life of the contract.  The award of individual task orders will be competed between the firms chosen for award of the IDIQ contracts and selection will be based upon price and other factors stated in each request for task order proposal.  Although the IDIQ contracts will provide labor hour pricing for evaluation purposes, the task orders will be firm-fixed price.  The labor hour rates stated in the contract will be considered maximums.  At task order proposal time, offerors may propose a rate for a required labor category that is less than that listed in the contract, but the contract rates shall not be exceeded.  A specific period of performance will be established for each task order.  The scope of work (SOW) for task orders will include design-build construction services to provide new construction and/or renovation of existing buildings, facilities, structures, and building systems.  SOWs and specifications in task orders may also include site work and related structures to provide a complete, functional compound.  Task orders may include security improvements, new facilities, design/build construction, fire and life safety upgrades, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), to include chemical and biological filtration, energy conservation projects, electrical and mechanical system upgrades and similar work.  The types of design services may include, architecture and urban design; structural, civil, energy conservation, mechanical, electrical, seismic and geotechnical engineering, space planning and systems furniture integration, interior design, signage, technical and physical security, communication, RF shielding system design, blast protection design, fire protection engineering, potable water treatment and waste water treatment, landscaping design, cost estimating, scheduling, value engineering, and administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved.  The work must comply with either the applicable U.S. Government codes, regulations and standards, or the host country/city laws, codes and standards, whichever is more stringent.  Building design submission shall use hard metric units (Systems International).  Design submission phases will be identified in each task order and will typically include schematic design, design development (60%) submission and construction document (100%) submission.  Design deliverables shall include construction drawings in AutoCAD, specifications, schedule of rates/bill of quantities, reports and calculations.  Construction services may include labor and materials to execute the OBO approved design; on-site organization with management of lines of authority to ensure overall project coordination; overall control throughout the life of the project.  Services include documentation submittals and institution of controlling programs such as:  quality control program, construction scheduling, cost control, and project close-out.  Background information on the Standard Embassy Design may be viewed at: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/37418.pdf.  Closing:  ALL SUBMITTALS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 2:00 P.M. EST May 12, 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) located at MacDill AFB, Florida has the requirement for dual flat plate antenna assemblies for use with an X-band tail radar system onboard NOAA AOC WP-3D aircraft. This tail radar system, along with a C-band lower fuselage system radar system, is used for meteorological research and reconnaissance. The tail radar system measures reflectivity and Doppler velocity to determine wind field characteristics. The purpose of the dual flat plate antenna assemblies is to acquire forward and aft looking scans of the environment around the aircraft. The scope of this effort is to design and manufacture one or more dual flat plate X-band antenna assemblies meeting the requirements stated by the NOAA AOC for use in NOAA WP-3D aircraft tail radar systems. This effort requires design and fabrication of flat plate antennas, design and fabrication of framework required to mount the antennas to a Government furnished antenna pedestal in the tail section of the NOAA WP-3D aircraft, purchase of dual channel rotary joints to feed the radar signals through the rotating pedestal, purchase of waveguide and other parts as required, assembly of the tail antenna unit, characterization of the beam pattern, and verification of proper operation. The Government will be responsible for waveguide installation between the rotary joint and the aircraft. The dual flat plate antennas must fit into the current tail radome of NOAA’s WP-3D aircraft. The tail radome has an interior diameter of approximately 53” with a depth of approximately 70” before the radome begins to taper off. Drawings of the radome will be provided by the Government. Each of the dual flat plate antenna assemblies shall be optimized to operate in the 9310- 9328 MHz frequency range. The beam width shall be less than or equal to 2.0 degrees. The side lobe levels shall be at least 30dB down from the main lobe level. The antenna gain shall be maximized for the given beam width and side lobe levels. The antennas shall operate with a squint angle of 20°. Each antenna shall have linear horizontal polarization with respect to the earth (vertical polarization with respect to the pedestal axis of rotation). Each antenna assembly, including its waveguide and dual channel rotary joint shall be capable of withstanding the power level of the radar transmitter (70 kW peak), and shall be able to operate at altitudes up to 35,000 feet. The waveguide from the transmitter unit is pressurized with air to the aircraft cabin’s altitude; the antenna assembly shall maintain the integrity of the waveguide pressurization. The total weight of the two antennas plus the mounting framework used to attach the antennas to a Government furnished antenna pedestal shall be approximately 112 pounds or less, and shall have a center of gravity not greater than approximately 32 inches from the surface at which the framework mounts to the antenna pedestal. The Government may purchase up to two additional flat plate antenna assemblies within one calendar year of  base award and two additional flat plate antenna assemblies during the Option Year.  Initial system delivery shall be no later than August 2007. Option system deliveries to be determined. The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12, Commercial Items and Part 15 Contracting By Negotiation. This acquisition is unrestricted as to business size.  Solicitation issue date is expected by end of April 2006 with contract award expected by end of July 2006.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. CRAD requires all contractors doing business with this office to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site:http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) Systems Manager held an Industry Day in July 2005, in order to examine all current decontaminants and applicators to determine what interim solutions may exist for the ability to decontaminate the interiors of vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft.  The industry day was also designed to see if the capability exists to decontaminate sensitive equipment contained within those assets, which have been exposed to Chemical, Biological, radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents/contamination and/or Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs)/Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and new threat agents (NTAs).  This requirement is associated with Joint Service and multinational capabilities for detecting, identifying and eliminating CBRN hazards.  JPID will decontaminate sensitive equipment items installed in platform interiors without requiring removal of the equipment.  
 
We would like to thank all of the company representatives for your participation in the industry day events held at Brooks City-Base last July and also inform you that as the program continues to develop, all future requests for information/proposals will be posted to FEDBIZOPS.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of 12 new Transportable SATCOM Ground Terminals (TSGT), including 9 full terminals and 3 support rigs, and the upgrade of 7 Tri-band TSGTs in the NATO inventory. These projects are included in Project serial 2003/0CM03018-0 under CP 0A0149 for the procurement of SATCOM Communications System Capabilities, that include the procurement of 12 TSGTs and Project serial 2003/0CM03034-0 under CP 5A0030 for the upgrade of the 7 second generation TSGTs.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the Infrastructure Committee.  The rough cost estimate of the project is 22.85 million EUR ($27.5 million USD) for the procurement of 12 TSGTs and 3.54 million EUR ($4.3 million USD) for the upgrade of the 7 TSGTs. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) is IFB-CO-11790-TSGT. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Both projects are expected to be completed in 18 months from the Effective Date of Contract (EDC). The Invitation for Bids (IFB) will be structured in 2 portions reflecting the procurement of new TSGTs and the upgrade of the NATO-owned tri-band TSGTs. The Bidders will be allowed to choose whether to bid for only one or for both portions. The two portions will be evaluated and awarded separately.

The competitive bidding is limited to companies experienced with the provision of similar types of systems; in addition, the bidders will be required to submit with their bid a Certificate of Conformity (COC) in accordance with STANAG 4107 for the qualified Terminal (TSGT) that they will propose for the new TSGT project. 

The envisaged method of bidding for both portions will be the One Envelope Procedure in which the Price Proposals are opened and evaluated and the bids ranked in order by lowest price. Technical Evaluation then commences with the lowest price bid until a fully compliant bid is found.

ELIGIBILITY

<DESC>March 28, 2006


THE ABOVE REFERENCED NOTICE 06M69 IS MODIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA NUMBER 2 IS DELETED IN ITS ENTIRETY AND REPLACED WITH:

“Experience and capability in planning, facilitating, and implementing a plan        to survey state officials regarding federally-funded activities and technical assistance support, including the impact of federal support upon state systems”.

ALL PROPOSALS MAY BE E-MAILED TO CGANEY2@PSC.GOV, ALSO.

DUE DATE FOR PROPOSALS IS CHANGED TO APRIL 5, 2006 AT 5PM EST.

See the  questions and answers below: 


Q: I would like to know the number of SSA directors targeted for this survey across the 50 states and territories mentioned in the RFP.

A:  54 State Directors will be targeted for this Survey, including the 50 States, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Red Lake Band of the Chippewa Indian Nation.

Q:  What is the required length of the RFP for the solicitation State Satisfaction Survey--RFQ06M69. Is there a required font size? How many copies of the proposals are required?

A:   Up to 50 pages, Times new Roman 12 font.  E-mail separate copies of technical and cost proposals 

Q:  Does the survey instrument require OMB clearance since it will be administered to about 60 respondents.  There does not appear to be time included in the SOW for such clearance.  If it is required, where would the estimated length of time to obtain such clearance be included? 
A:   OMB clearance will not be required, as SAMHSA has an umbrella clearance for customer satisfaction surveys which covers this activity.
 

Q: Where might we view copies of earlier evaluations of CSAT’s technical assistance to States? 
A:  Copies of previous evaluations are not being provided.


Q: What is the government’s estimate of the level of effort for the project?
A:  Level of Effort does not apply with a fixed price simplified acquisition purchase order mechanism.

Q:  The survey was previously conducted through a subcontract arrangement as part of another CSAT contract.  How much was allocated to the subcontractor for performing the satisfaction survey and developing the subsequent evaluation reports?
A:  Those figures are not to be disclosed.

Q: What is the anticipated start date for this project?  
A:  As early as is feasible.

Q: What is the total size of the population to be surveyed? The RFP implies it is 54, that is, only one SSA Director per state (and DC, Puerto Rica, Virgin Islands, Chippewa Tribe). Or are there multiple SSA Directors per state/territory/tribe? 
A: The total population is 54, including the one Single State Agency Director from each State, plus the one for the District of Columbia, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Red Lake Band of the Chippewa Nation. 
Q:  Assuming OMB clearance is required, do you have expedited clearance or is the full six-month OMB process required? 
A:  No OMB Clearance is required for this Survey, since SAMHSA has an umbrella approval from OMB for Customer  Satisfaction Surveys which covers this initiative.
Q: Is there only one questionnaire, or more than one? Task 6 implies that there are two data collection efforts: "topical issue" and "point-of-service." Or are these parts of a single questionnaire? Can we see the existing questionnaire? 
A:  There is only one survey questionnaire, and revisions are in process. We can not provide a copy of the Survey, which is currently being revised.
Q:  Task 4 asks for feedback on the questionnaire and process -- Do you anticipate changing the process from an annual survey to something different than that?
A: This will remain an annual survey, based on calendar years. 

Q: What "software" is expected in Task 8? 
A:  CSAT has chosen to stipulate use of a specific software package (Perseus Survey Solutions) which we regard as optimal for this purpose.

Q:  Can we use our GSA MOBIS Schedule rates or do we need to provide the indirect rate cost build-up instead? 
A:  Yes, You can use your GSA rates , but you must provide documentation from your  GSA contract.
Q: For all statements that contain "Within X days of the EDOA..", does this refer to calendar days or business days?
A: The statements regarding “Within X days of the EDOA” are calendar days. 


Q: In Task 2, you refer to "a description of TA and Technical Reviews". What does "TA" stand for?
A: TA means Technical Assistance, which the federal government provides to states.


Q: Who will be made available to validate the interview instrument's reliability for attaining statistically valid data after Task 2 has been completed (and before it is subjected to a pilot)?
A: If the contractor is unable to validate the instrument’s reliability, CSAT staff will be asked to provide that support and consultation.

Q: What sample population will be provided to pilot test the instrument?
A: Only a few state directors will be utilized for the pilot study, to be determined by 
CSAT.

Q: Tasks 4 thru 7 seems to be several, iterative review sessions with the DSCA. Why are so many sessions needed?  Wouldn't it be more advisable that they be part of a review of the Task 2 deliverable and a participant in Task 3?
A: CSAT will retain the option of lessening the actual number of sessions for review and discussion.


Q: Task 8 requests the design of the annual report from data derived from the survey instrument.  Shouldn't this be done up front during Task 2 to assure the instrument is designed to capture the requisite data?
A: The essential format for the annual report will be provided by CSAT, but we will 
retain the option of a stipulated revision of that format based on Survey findings.

Q:  Can the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant GPRA measures from prior years be provided up front in Task 2 since the data collected must be able to correlate to these measures?  Specifically, we need to understand how subjective factors have been quantified; such as the number of States that express satisfaction with the technical assistance provided - how is this determined?  What specific questions were posed? 
A:  The precise content of survey questions will be provided to the successful bidder.


Q: In the Schedule of Payments, there are "TBD" for dollars associated to each task deliverable.  Who makes this determination, and when?
A: The Government Project Officer will make the determination at the payments at designated intervals.


Q: The signature requested on Standard Form 18 - can that be an electronic signature, or must the hard copy document be scanned to be delivered via email?
A:  Yes, It can be an electronic signature.

Q: What is the size standard for this RFQ?
A: 50 pages or less.

Q:  Attachment A, Technical Evaluation Criteria, Item #2 & #4, These evaluation criteria seem to indicate that only an incumbent contractor could receive the 20 points provided for experience and capabilities.  Would SAMSHA remove these criteria and replace them with experience and capabilities requirements that describe a vendor’s and key personnel’s ability to do the work?
A:  See amendment of Technical Criteria number 2 at top of the questions and answers.

Q: Can a copy of the 2004 (or prior) survey be provided along with any reports describing the data collection process and response rate? What was/were the survey mechanism(s) used to collect the 2004data, i.e. web-based?
A:  We can not provide a copy of the 2004 Survey. The 2004 Survey was web-based, with a paper option available. Response rates have been consistently above 90 percent. 

Q:  If there is a target calendar start date for the contract, would you please include it?
A:  No target date has been set; we need to expedite it as much as is feasible.

Q:  Has SAMSHA used a solely web-based approach with this survey in the past?
A:  We can not provide a copy of the 2004 Survey. The 2004 Survey was web-based, with a paper option available. Response rates have been consistently above 90 percent. 

Q: Will SAMSHA consider proposals for other than web-based data collection? 
A:  Must be web-based, with paper option. 

Q: What media and formats will be used to supply the successful contractor with the specified lists (1-3) described in Task 2, i.e. WORD files, Excel, Access, Flat files?
A:  Word
 
Q: Does SAMSHA have reliable electronic mail addresses for the survey respondents?
A:  Yes.

Q: Are criteria for the revision of the survey instrument already developed? If yes, do the criteria focus on content, method of presentation, or both? If yes, please provide the criteria, and the background materials (such as any data justifying the changes) to the criteria.
A:  All Survey revisions will be directed/suggested by SAMHSA/CSAT, and             the contractor will be asked to submit questions in accordance with 
those directions.

Q:  Please describe the type of adjustments that may need to be made to the survey instrument.
A: All Survey revisions will be directed/suggested by SAMHSA/CSAT, and             the contractor will be asked to submit questions in accordance with 
those directions.

Q:  Will the revised survey instrument require OMB clearance to comply with the Paper Work Reduction Act? 
A: No OMB clearance is required, due to SAMHSA's umbrella approval for 	  customer satisfaction surveys.

Q:  Is the contractor responsible for recruiting the pilot test sample from the SSAs?
A:  The choice of the sample for pilot test will be made by SAMHSA/CSAT.

Q:  Does the GPO have criteria for what constitutes a successful conclusion for this task?
A:  The GPO expects an objective assessment of SSAs' views presented in     format that is useful for staff development training and improvement 	  purposes, as well as for reporting on GPRA measures.

If no, are there plans to capture their feedback during the report format process for 2005?
A:  None of the requested information regarding the 2004 Survey is to be 	 made available, including queries about stakeholders' receiving feedback, etc. SAMHSA will provide information to the contractor  which will allow comparisons of previous years' results for report formatting.

Q:  What are the alternatives for submitting a proposal electronically, i.e. WORD, PDF, etc.?
Based on the direction, an electronic version of the SF 18 with the authorized official from the contractor signature will be acceptable by the government, rather than a faxed or hard copy with the signature. Is that correct?
A:  Word and electronic copy of the SF-18 are acceptable.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources in support of the Targets and Countermeasures Directorate (MDA/DET).  MDA/DET is conducting market research to identify Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small Businesses (SB) that have prior experience or the ability to rapidly mature and demonstrate their capability to develop, fabricate, maintain, integrate and test missile systems and instrumentation packages, and provide launch services for low fidelity ballistic missile targets to demonstrate the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) asset readiness for major tests, the cost of which typically ranges from $250,000 to $2 Million, dependent upon complexity.  Systems will support multiple customers at different ranges with varying missile configurations.  The missile/test requirement includes:
                                                                 
1)	Maximum use of excess government furnished property (GFP) rocket motors along with existing hardware such as aft skirts and fin sets and use existing mature technology to fabricate and successfully launch the test missiles. If, after analysis of requirements and considering available GFP motors and other assets, it is determined that these assets can not meet requirements, the contractor would make a recommendation for commercial motor(s) as alternative solutions. 
2)	Requested missiles will normally be flown unguided and without a flight termination system (FTS) from rail launchers at a number of different launch sites.  
3)	A number of separation planes on the mission/test article based on the number of rocket motors.
4)	Separation systems to reduce tip off rates.
5)	Possible requirements for the encryption of data.
6)	Articles in the field of regard to include the nose cone, attitude control/payload section, items ejected as payload, and spent rocket motor(s).  
7)	Attitude control/payload section with or without a spent rocket motor attached could be required to hold attitude, tumble, roll, ordnance initiation devices, etc. at prescribed mission times or altitudes.  
8)	Selected sections such as the nose cone and attitude control/payload section would usually require an instrumentation and telemetry system able to provide position, velocity, roll rate, and attitude data for collection
9)	Additional instrumentation in the form of pressure transducers, thermal couples, etc. may be required based on specific mission needs.  
                                                                 
All efforts would be closely coordinated with the government and their selected support contractors to accomplish mission objectives.

<CONTACT>Phyllis Townsley, 405-954-7816
<DESC>Only those 8(a) vendors that are certified under the Small Business Administration (SBA) in Area VI (AR, LA, NM, OK, and TX) will be allowed to participate in this acquisition.  Refer to additional information provided in this Announcement/SIR1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for janitorial services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The general scope of work for these services will require the contractor to furnish all personnel, supplies, materials, and cleaning equipment in the performance of building janitorial services for approximately 3.0M square feet of office space, classrooms, etc., in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).   Requirements are further defined in the attached SOW.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options. This acquisition is set-aside exclusively for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.  Only those 8(a) firms that are certified under the SBA in Area VI (AR, LA, NM, OK, and TX) will be allowed to participate in this requirement.  To be considered, a vendor must be classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561720, Janitorial Services - $15/million.  Each firm claiming 8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this Announcement/SIR1.  Firms are to submit an FAA Business Declaration form with your response to this Announcement/SIR1.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each vendor's program eligibility. Should an 8(a) vendor intend to incorporate a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" shall apply to the prime contractor. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the Announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies that are certified under the 8(a) program with SBA within Area VI an opportunity to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this Announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this Announcement/SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this Announcement/SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 	1.  8(a) Certification and Business Declaration Form: 	(a) Provide certification letter from SBA documenting vendor's enrollment in the SBA's 8(a) program and classification as a small business under the North American Industry Classification system (NAIC) code 561720, Janitorial Service. 	(b) Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form. 2.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents "how well" an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has "done it."  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the SOW.) 	(a) In order to be determined acceptable vendors must have a minimum of five (5) years experience in performing janitorial/custodial services as identified in the attached SOW.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude, and level.

<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>Brookhaven Science Associates plans to acquire a Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) tool for the Nanopatterning Laboratory of the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.   DRIE is an inductively-coupled plasma etching process that can fabricate micro and nanoscale structures with extremely high aspect ratios from silicon wafers and a few other select materials.

DRIE silicon etch processes can be divided into the Bosch process, which controls the sidewall geometry by rapidly cycling between etching and deposition steps, and the Cryo process, which uses a substrate cooled to about –100oC to promote oxide/fluoride deposition to preserve the sidewalls as well as inhibiting attack of the protective mask.  The Bosch process requires high capacity vacuum pumps, mass flow controllers with rapid-response rates, and relatively high etch gas flow rates that increase operating costs.  The Cryo process requires a cryogenically cooled stage, control of oxygen at low flow rates, and careful attention to efficient thermal transfer between the wafer and the stage. 

It is required that DRIE etching equipment for the CFN must have both Cryo and Bosch etching capability.  Prospective vendors must supply detailed specifications on how their equipment meets the above requirements for both the Bosch and Cryo process and be prepared to etch test silicon wafers supplied by BNL using both methods.  The wafers will be returned to BNL and evaluated by optical and scanning microscopy.  

Equipment Criteria:

Vendors must supply detailed descriptions and dimensioned layout drawings of the deep reactive ion etcher, the materials used in its construction, failure rate data and, where applicable, manufacturer’s specifications of subsystems such as vacuum pumps, mass flow controllers, and RF generators.  The vendors proposed system will be evaluated for operational reliability, quality of construction, and cost.  

Process Criteria:

Vendors must provide a details concerning etching chemistry, power level and, material removal rates.  BSA will submit its samples to the vendor’s application laboratory and evaluate the results with its own equipment. 

Proposals are due April 09, 2006, by 4:00 PM, EDT, and shall be submitted to Brookhaven Science Associates, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Attention: D. Paveglio, Bldg. 355, Upton, NY 11973, by US mail

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS only.  The purpose of the Sources Sought Synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified business sources for upgrades to the HVAC system at the Paul H. Findley Federal Building, Springfield, Illinois.  The Paul H. Findley Federal Building was constructed in 1930. The building is a three-story classical structure sheathed in limestone (approx. 140,000 Gross Square Feet). Most of the HVAC system units are over 45 years old and have the following problems: insufficient cooling for computers & modern office equipment; inadequate fresh air; improper zoning; and frequent breakdowns. The project includes the replacement of the heating and cooling, temperature control/energy management, and piping systems. The project also involves replacement of ceiling systems, and the removal and disposal of all asbestos containing materials (ACM) encountered during the demolition and/or replacement of the AHU’s ductwork and piping.  Work has been phased to allow for tenants to swing from their current space to a temporary location, and then back.  The building will be fully occupied during construction.  There is limited swing space for tenant moves.  The construction contractor will be mindful of tenant disruptions, schedule and noise.  The construction contractor will communicate with building management, advising schedule plans at least two weeks in advance.  The swing space will need some alterations to accommodate the various tenants electrical and data/phone needs.  Some of the work will be performed after normal business hours (6 p.m. – 6 a.m., weekends, and holidays) allowing the smaller tenants to remain in their space and not impact tenant operations.  Existing furniture may need to be temporarily removed to accommodate construction.  The project has been designed. A construction contractor is being sought to provide construction services during the construction phase. It is anticipated that this project will take approximately 700 calendar days to complete.  The estimated construction cost range is between $5,000,000.00 to $7,000,000.00. This procurement for Building Alterations falls under NAICS Code 236220 and the current size standard for this work category is $31 million. Potential qualified business sources having the capabilities to perform the services described herein are invited to respond and state their interest in the project by submitting via e-mail, a one-page letter on company letterhead to Ms. Johnnie A. Gaskew, Contracting Officer, no later than April 11, 2006.  That e-mail address is johnnie.gaskew@gsa.gov.  In response to this announcement, please provide a letter containing at a minimum the following information: name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company, the company’s status as an 8(a) firm, a small business firm, a small disadvantaged firm, a large business firm, a women-owned business, a veteran-owned firm or a Federal HUBZone certified firm.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information about potential 8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business sources for REFURBISHMENT OF BUILDING 2N AND REPLACEMENT OF ROOFS AT BUILDING 2N & 2S. The following is only a general overview of the project: The NAICS code for this project is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31 Million. This NAICS code ties directly with FAR 19 for the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, under the title of Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. This project will refurbish the north wing of building 2, Public Affairs Building, which is approximately 17,644 square feet.  The refurbishment will upgrade the facility while meeting LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) accreditation for refurbishment work as established by the U.S. Green Building Council.  The project is currently slated to receive a Silver rating under LEED New Construction version 2.1.  The refurbishment will include the removal of all asbestos.  It will upgrade the architectural, mechanical, HVAC, plumbing, fire suppression, fire detection, and electrical systems.  It will replace the window wall system to meet LEED energy and day lighting requirements.	An underfloor air system will be installed.  The majority of the floor plan will consist of an open floor plan layout to maximize lighting from windows.  LEED's features will include  reduced site disturbance, water efficient landscaping, 20% water use reduction, additional commissioning, and optimal energy performance.	Energy savings will be established through Energy Modeling.  Indoor environmental quality benefits include low VOC materials, thermal comfort, day lighting, and IAQ management.	 Materials and resources includes use of Certified wood, construction waste management, and use of recycled products.  This project will also provide for replacement of approximately 60,000 square feet of built up roofing at building 2 Public Affairs Building.  The facility drainage system shall be upgraded as needed to allow for positive slope for drainage.  A fall protection system shall be installed on all exposed edges.  The new roofing system will offer greater wind resistance to hurricane impacts and have greater energy efficiency.  During the construction, a plastic containment  tarp will be hung in the auditorium to protect the area from possible dislodged asbestos.  It is anticipated that the majority of the lightweight concrete is wet, crumbled and must be replaced.  NOTE:  Project design is being modified to install a reflective coating which will allow for attainment of the LEED credit on roofing.  The roofing will be done concurrently with the refurbishment of building 2 north. The magnitude of the project shall be between $5 and $10 Million. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references.  All material submitted shall not contain binding of any kind or submitted in hard or soft folders. Any questions should be submitted in writing and sent to Maria.J.Hooks@nasa.gov. Responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business (please specify whether an 8(a), HubZone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business), ownership, parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).   Responses should also address experience in refurbishment of a building of this magnitude on a Federal installation, OSHA violations within the last 3 years, and experience in LEED and Total Building Commissioning. Futhermore, respondents should adress the following: 1.) Experience in developing Safety Plans, 2.) Qualified Project Managers and Superintendants familiar with construction of Federal Contracts, 3.) Experience in developing change proposals and recommending alternative solutions to design discrepencies. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   After completing the Government's analysis, a determination shall be made for full and open competition or to consider a HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Maria J. Hooks no later than April 10, 2006.	Please reference NNJ06ZBJ302L in any response.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

The NRC’s Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) is responsible for the licensing and
regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors and research reactors in the United
States. NRR implements regulations and develops and implements policies, programs, and
procedures pertaining to all aspects of licensing and inspection of these facilities. NRR
activities for new reactor licensing include application reviews for reactor design certifications,
early site permits (ESPs), combined construction operating license (COL) applications, and new
reactor pre-application activities.

As discussed in SECY-06-0019, (www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/secys/2006/secy2006-0019/2006-0019scy.pdf) “Semiannual Update of the Status of New Reactor Licensing Activities and Future Planning for New Reactors,” dated January 31, 2006, the NRC is preparing for the review of new reactor license applications that are projected to be submitted during the Fiscal Years 2007 and 2008. Currently, the new reactor designs to be reviewed include the AP 1000, ESBWR and EPR. The NRC is developing the licensing infrastructure and resources necessary to review these applications. The NRC now estimates that as many as thirteen COL applications may be filed in FY 2007 and 2008.

Given this heightened interest, anticipated growth, and importance of meeting the schedule of new reactor licensing activities, NRR has undertaken a major reorganization to address the anticipated increased workload for new reactor licensing and plans to add additional staff. Contractor support is also needed to prepare for new reactor licensing and anticipated reviews of new reactor license applications.

The NRC is seeking sources that are interested in supporting our technical assistance requirements.  Please access and complete the Corporate Capabilities spreadsheet (www.nrc.gov/who-we-are/skill-setmatrix3-13-06.pdf) and the Market Research Questions (set forth below).

Only propulsion contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of the resulting BAA or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions when the BAA is issued. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-353-3572) for further information on the certification process. You must submit a copy or AFRL must have a copy on file of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the solicitation.

All replies to this RFI are to be provided to the USAF by electronic copy and may be followed by an oral presentation not to exceed 4 hours at AFRL Edwards, CA.

Program Description
The Air Force is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only to allow potential propulsion contractors to submit questions, comments and suggestions prior to the potential release of a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) PKTA-06-01.

The purpose of this RFI is to obtain propulsion contractor input to enable AFRL to define the best approach for an efficient and successful component and rocket engine concept demonstration test program. AFRL is particularly interested in technical concepts and program approaches that will insure program success while meeting all the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) Hydrocarbon Boost Phase II goals and operability metrics.  Your comments/ questions are solicited on a proposed program that will analyze, design, fabricate, deliver and provide test hardware for critical component and engine system demonstration tests for innovative technologies to reduce risk for future highly operable systems. The component and engine designs demonstrated by this program could be the basis for a future contracted Rocket Engine development program and are to be traceable to the ‘Vision’ design space.  Therefore, potential propulsion contractors must have existing experience or qualifications with the analysis, design, manufacturing, and testing of high thrust LOX/HC engines.  This includes the existing manpower and in-house/ contracted facilities capable of efficiently and successfully meeting both the technical and program goals of this program.

A draft of BAA-PKTA-06-01 associated with this RFI shall be forthcoming approximately 2 weeks after RFI post date.  The engine conceptual design and hot firing ground tests are to be conducted for a reusable Oxidizer Rich Staged Combustion (ORSC) cycle engine with 250K lbf sea level thrust, using the propellants Liquid Oxygen (LOx) and Rocket Grade Kerosene (per Mil-DTL-25576D) to meet all the IHPRPT Hydrocarbon Boost Phase II goals as well as additional Operability metrics.  Thus, selection of the engine pressure schedules, nozzle area ratio, propellant flow rates, turbomachinery, and mixture ratios of the preburner and the main thrust chamber must not only consider booster sea level and vacuum flight performance, but also flight reliability, reuse requirements and production costs.  Also ground and in flight ignition, cooling, combustion stability of both the preburner and the main thrust chamber, and must consider risk, reuse, and reliability of the engine system. 

The BAA is currently planned to be issued to industry in June of 2006 with a planned authority to proceed (ATP) in January of 2007.  One cost plus contract with hybrid fee structure entailing fixed fee (CPFF), and/or incentive fee (CPIF), and/or award fee (CPAF) unclassified contract may be awarded for this liquid rocket engine demonstration test program.  Maximum possible funding to contractor for the potential contact award is up to ninety-nine million dollars ($99,000,000.00), and the program including testing can be up to 8 years in duration from authority to proceed (ATP).  Tests are to demonstrate the performance and operating characteristics of the conceptual engine technologies for the potential development of future reusable LOx/RP oxidizer rich staged combustion booster engines for USAF space missions.

Potential Contracted Program
The possible LOx/RP liquid rocket engine component and engine assembly demonstration test program will be unclassified with limited distribution.  The objectives of this future contracted effort are to provide AFRL with reusable liquid rocket engine test hardware to prove out innovative technologies. The components will be integrated for engine demonstration testing. Concept demonstration test hardware is to be provided with the most cost effective schedule for component and engine system hardware tests. Major critical engine components are summarized as follows.

Rocket Engine Assembly (REA)
Major components of the REA are: the Oxidizer Rich Preburner (ORPB), Thrust Chamber Assembly (TCA), Turbo Pump Assembly (TPA), thrust mount, gimbal mount, thrust in-flight control, thrust vector control (TVC) and roll control if required by a single booster engine, heat exchanger(s) and/or bleed(s) for vehicle tank pressurization, and in-flight engine controller and health monitoring system.   The only components to be evaluated and demonstrated during this contracted program are the ORPB, TPA, and TCA.  Other engine components will not be evaluated as part of this contract unless clearly identified by the respondent as within the proposed program scope.

Oxidizer Rich Preburner (ORPB)
Major components of the ORPB are: the LOX and Rocket Grade Kerosene preburner flow control valves, nontoxic/ non-pyrophoric reusable igniter, injector, and mixer combustion chamber.  The preburner must incorporate a stable combustion zone to provide the resulting hot oxidizer rich gas exit flow stream with uniform pressure and temperature flow distribution into the turbopump assembly turbine.  A key preburner design goal is reusable and reliable ignition with the resulting stable combustion providing the uniform and repeatable temperature flow field at the exit of the preburner.  

Turbo Pump Assembly (TPA)
Major components of the TPA are: the LOX boost pump, if required, main LOX pump, Rocket Grade Kerosene boost pump, if required, main Rocket Grade Kerosene pump, seals and bearings, and uncoated oxidizer rich gas turbine. The pump assembly must consider reusability and reliability for the booster engine requirements.

Thrust Chamber Assembly (TCA)
Major components of the TCA are: the Rocket Grade Kerosene main flow control valve, the combustion chamber and nozzle cooling jacket, the LOX rich gas and Rocket Grade Kerosene liquid injector, and a nontoxic/ non- pyrophoric reusable igniter.  The TCA must meet the engine booster requirements.

Government Furnished Equipment: USAF Rocket Component and Engine Test Facility
AFRL will provide test facilities including test stand, power, instrumentation, all fluids, propellants, test stand integration management, and test facility interface management if requested. Funding previously identified does not include any of the costs of the AFRL test facilities, consumables, testing, and data acquisition which will be Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) provided by the USAF at no cost to the potential contractor.

If GFE test facility is utilized, hardware test end items will be delivered to the test site complete with all valves, controls, orifices, and test instrumentation as identified by test interface control document (ICD).  All test stand instrumentation and data acquisition systems are to be provided by the Government.  Candidate contractors are to specify all electrical power requirements for their proposed hardware and instrumentation, including any potential unique requirements. The contractor shall also provide facility pressure, capacity, and flowrate requirements for the propellants to be utilized for both component and integrated system test campaigns. Also any unique ignition system power requirements or purge requirements are to be identified.

AFRL technical POC will provide candidate contractors upon request with a test cell schematic showing all facility hookups and interconnection hardware. All mechanical, electrical, propellant, fluid, and gas interfaces/ requirements are to be compatible with AFRL Test Stand 2A capabilities unless otherwise identified. Responses to this RFI will be used by the government to make appropriate planning decisions.  

Questions for RFI Orals
In order for the government to adequately assess and improve the BAA requirements and the resulting contracted programs, candidate contractors are encouraged to provide responses to the following questions.  Answers to these questions should be in addition to other contractor comments and suggestions provided during the oral presentation. As part of the RFI the respondent should provide AFRL with an estimated total contracted program schedule and resulting ROM total program costs along with an estimated Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) funding profile required by government fiscal year (GFY) in million of US dollars per year. 

The respondent may suggest any changes to the draft BAA and contracted program scope that could improve results. Also, the respondent should discuss potential ROM program cost savings for the design and demonstration of the proposed critical component and engine assembly test program.  These recommendations must consider the program need and cost for: analysis, design, materials, fabrication, delivery of test hardware, hardware modifications during tests, test liaison, post test data analysis, and all program technical and financial reporting including interim / final technical reports. Respondents are encouraged to discuss contract and program recommendations that can reduce the baseline schedule and/or cost and still meet the demonstration test objectives. 

	1.	What are the critical components and how will component design problems be corrected during the component tests program to insure successful engine assembly tests. What is your baseline overall program schedule and estimated ROM funding requirements per government fiscal year?

2.	What hardware quantities, number and types of tests and fabrication/rework schedule would you recommend prior to and during demonstration testing to reduce program risk, maintain schedule and insure program success?

3.	Provide comments and list of any additional data required for baseline AFRL test cell installation and all mechanical, electrical, propellant interface, and sequence- timing issues.  This should include any special requirements for hydraulic, electrical or pneumatic systems.

4.	Discuss major design and demonstration test issues and risks to be considered in a BAA and the contracted program. Are there contract and program recommendations that can reduce the schedule and/or cost and still meet the demonstration test program objectives?

5.	Are there any new materials or technologies from related or unrelated applications that could be applied to the demonstration program?  If so, what are these materials and technologies and identify the risks associated with incorporating these into this contracted program.

6.	The definition of a Metric for Operability has been identified as an area of high risk in the preliminary risk assessment.  Definition of operability and how it impacts engine operations is ill-defined. What are the drivers/ factors such as supportability, cost, and engine readiness that define good goal sets to determine engine design requirements for operability? What metrics are to be measured to assesses progress on meeting operability goals? Identify areas for improvements (health management, building in robustness, etc)

7.	What analytical and software tools do you envision being required to support a contracted program and how have these tools been validated?  Do you possess sufficient computational resources either within your company or government for the proposed effort? 

8.	Summarize your company’s and any potential subcontractor’s background, related experience and capabilities in the analysis, design, development and testing of LOX/HC booster engines.  Specifically, what lessons learned can be translated from these previous efforts into the development of a highly operable, reusable rocket grade kerosene/Lox booster.  This should include production experience with numbers of engines, thrust levels, and program time periods.

9.	 Discuss any preburner experience for possible integration into an oxygen-rich staged combustion rocket engine that could reduce program risk.

10.	Discuss current baseline design approach(s)/concept(s) for a nontoxic/ non-pyrophoric reusable ignition system for the preburner and main combustion chamber to support this potential contract.

11.	Are there any novel technologies that can be inserted into this demonstration effort that will further the goal of developing a highly operable, reusable booster engine.

12.	What data right limitations must this contracted program consider based on potential proprietary or patent issues? 

13.	Comment as necessary on the criteria which will be used to evaluate the fee areas for design, build, and test which may be investigated under a Cost plus Hybrid Fee program.

14.	Comment as necessary on the proposed evaluation criteria listed in the Draft BAA.

15.	Any other technical and program suggestions that would make this contracted program more efficient to meet the USAF needs and program goals. Comment as necessary on anything felt important.

<SUBJECT>B -- Special Consulting Services
<DESC>Public comment is sought regarding consulting services available to support development of a business approach to using current and emerging standards and products to locate, request, receive and utilize medical evidence in support of SSA’s disability determination functions.  SSA requires efficient access to medical information for disability claimants and sees great potential in utilizing standards-based practices and systems already under development in the health care industry.  SSA seeks information regarding consulting services familiar with current and emerging standard transactions such as Health Level Seven Clinical Document Architecture (HL7/CDA),  and HIPAA claims attachment transactions 277 (Requests) and 275 (Responses).  These consulting services should also be familiar with the standardized clinical codesets and structures in use and proposed for medical settings to capture the medical information, such as LOINC, SNOMED, and ICD-10-CM.  These consulting services should also be knowledgeable in the management and utilization of information receiving using such transactions and codesets.

BACKGROUND: The Social Security Administration makes approximately 15 million requests for medical records annually as part of the processing of claims of disability under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act.  Currently, both the requests from SSA and the responses from medical providers are made using a multitude of formats including conventional mail, fax, and electronic uploads.  SSA now has in place a national electronic folder for storing and accessing claims-related information.  Most of the information is converted from paper using scanning, but in the interest of speed and efficiency for both SSA and providers, SSA desires to obtain as much information in electronic standards based formats as possible.  SSA currently uses images to process claims, but wants to realize the potential of obtaining and using medical information as data that can eventually be used in decision support business processes and systems.

The President’s Federal Health Architecture (FHA) initiative requires SSA to make changes in its business process and capabilities to interoperate with individuals and entities who have implemented the FHA standards.  On a broader scale, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) has been charged with coordinating an industry-wide drive for interoperable health information exchange, based on standards for transactions, codesets, and clinical architecture.

SSA desires to integrate its business processes as closely as possible with related business processes being deployed in the general health care community.  However, SSA is not a healthcare provider, so its business processes must consider features not present in transaction between payers and providers in the healthcare context.  SSA must provide information to locate and identify the appropriate medical information, SSA must provide a release for the medical record, and SSA must pay for the information received.

What are the availability, capability and experience of consulting services that would enable SSA to find information and products necessary to develop and migrate to a business process that utilizes standards-based transactions for locating, requesting, receiving and utilizing medical information?

Are these consulting services available to provide responses to the following questions:
•	How can SSA best accomplish building the framework for the new business process?
•	How should a new business process be best aligned with comparable business processes in the general health care environment?  
•	How could the transition effect the current environment at SSA?
•	What services, products and processes exist for maximizing the utility of the medical information once it is received in the future as both structured and unstructured data?

We are interested in consulting services that may be of value to any part of the process of obtaining and using medical records, not just end-to-end solutions.  Please provide enough documentation to address the needs described and permit an initial assessment of the potential.

DATES: Responses should be submitted to the Social Security Administration, Office of Disability Programs, Office of Process Policy, Health Informatics Branch, before 5:00 p.m. EDT on May 31, 2006.

<SUBJECT>--PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE ASSAULT HOSELINE SYSTEM (AHS)
<DESC>ERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE ASSAULT HOSELINE SYSTEM (AHS) Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit interest in the implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Assault Hoseline System (AHS). The Army is looking for potential contractors to perform in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider for the AHS. In Accordance With (IAW) AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; i  ncreased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  The selected PBL contractor will be responsible for some portion of the system logistics support, which could include, but is not limited to, supply chain management (parts support) for field and sustainment level maintenance, sustainment level maintenance   (scheduled and unscheduled), and sustainment training. The Army will retain responsibility for the scheduled and unscheduled field maintenance of AHS systems.  Operator and maintenance training, (New Equipment Training (NET)) will be the prime (Original Equipment_Manufacturer(OEM))contractor's responsibility._ The system support processes will be transparent to the war fighter. In addition, the prime contractor will be responsible for vehicle configuration, including recommendation and implementation of c onfiguration changes to improve performance, reliability and maintenance. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 25 years.   Goals. Desired Results and Outcomes:  Expected performance results from the PBL provider for the AHS System is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to an increase in operational availability by; reducing the logistics footprint; reducing maintenance  /repair times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance; providing relief to the army from conducting sustainment training, and ultimately reducing O&S costs to the Army.   Measurements: Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation. Reduced Logistics Footprint: 	Measurable reduction in the time it takes to deliver field and sustainment level spare and repair parts to the requiring organization Reduced maintenance/repair times: 	Measurable reduction in the cycle time it takes to return repaired sustainment level equipment/parts to the supply system. Relief from conducting sustainment training: 	Measurable reduction in the number of sustainment training classes conducted by the Army. PBL System Candidates: Systems that will be supported using PBL are those systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and those undergoing reset/recap.  Operational profiles will include both+ wartime and peacetime Operations Tempo (Optempo) if availabl e.  See Appendix B for a profile of the AHS System.

The Army appreciates your participation in this survey.   APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Product and/or P rogram Managers (PM's), their designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).   PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a    predetermined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to ne gotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility. Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. New Equipment Training: The identification of personnel, training, and training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel develo per/provider to the trainer, user, and supporter. Sustainment Training: Individual and collective training conducted in the unit or resident schools, units, and organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistics support of fielded systems or equipment. Sustainment Maintenance: Sustainment maintenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance returns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system. It covers selected Direct Support (DS) tasks, Gener  al Support, and Depot maintenance. Field Maintenance: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the soldier. It covers crew, unit, and selected Direct Support (DS) mai ntenance tasks. Some system maintenance can be done at field level if, based on task analysis it is simple to complete or it is critical to mission readiness. Operational Availability: A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. APPENDIX B PROFILE FOR THE AHS Petroleum System:  Assault Hoseline System (AHS) Model Designators:  TBD System Description: The AHS is a mobile petroleum transport system having the mission to transfer large quantities of fuel between temporary bulk storage sites at various distances up to 2.5_miles. AHS can be combined to span several miles between storage points. The system is rapidly deployable and can be used over many different types of terrain and in various environments and is intended for use in rear support areas where large quantities of bulk petroleum are stored, transferred, and issued. The AHS is  an integral part of the Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) for both the Quartermaster (QM) Petroleum  Pipeline  and Terminal Operating Company and the QM Petroleum Supply Company, enabling these units to perform a critical part of their mission re quirement. The system consists of one 350 gallon per minute pump, an employment/retrieval device, 2.5 miles of four inch flexible hose on four reels, obstacle suspension kit, road crossing kit, spill kit, and repair kit. Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP):  1. System Description.  The AHS consists of 14,000 feet of 4-inch collapsible conduit, a 350-gallon per minute (GPM) engine driven pumping assembly, and various support kits required to emplace, recover, and operate the system.  This version of the AHS wil  l include a deployment/retrieval capability that was not part of previous systems.  The collapsible hoses will be stored and deployed from a powered reel system.  This capability allows the system to be emplaced and recovered using less personnel and equi p ment than the previous flaking box system.  The AHS provides bulk petroleum handling units the ability to move bulk fuel to/from storage locations that may not be accessible by vehicle, rail, or air.  The AHS can be connected to a fixed or tactical pipel in e, used to move fuel from a rail head to the tactical storage site, used to move fuel away from an airhead, or transfer fuel from the main road to the bulk storage site. 2. Wartime OMS/MP.  After mission identification, the employing unit emplaces the AHS following the general steps below: 	Choose an emplacement route.  Select a direct route that is free of obstacles.  If possible, try to parallel an existing road to aid construction and speed deployment.  	Determine the deployment trace distance and any elevation changes.  Determine the location of the pumping assembly by hydraulic analysis. 	Load the conduit deployment/recovery system onto the deployment vehicle.  Proceed to the start point. 	Secure the end of the conduit to a vehicle or other appropriate anchor. 	Begin deploying the conduit in accordance with the deployment/recovery operating instructions. 	After deployment of the conduit, emplace the pumping assembly.   	Connect the suction and discharge hoses to the pumping assembly.  	Connect the AHS conduit to the receipt storage tank. 	Once everything is connected, fill the line with fuel and gradually increase the line pressure until you reach the desired operating point. Transferring Bulk Fuel After the AHS is setup and performing the bulk fuel transfer mission, the system may be required to operate for up to 20 hours per day continuously. Other operations require fewer operating hours per day, but more start and stop cycles.  When being used to  transfer fuel from tankers, rail cars, or aircraft, system operation will be cyclic.  Pumping time will be long enough to empty the supplying vessels.  At the completion of pumping, the system is shutdown, disconnected from the supply source.  Full suppl y tanks are positioned and the AHS reconnected and transfer operations resumed.  This process is repeated up to 10-15 times a day, resulting in an operating time of 10-hours per 20-hour operational day.  System Recovery After completion of the bulk fuel transfer mission at a specific location, the AHS is evacuated, recovered, and redeployed at a new location.  Recovery and redeployment occurs once every 20 days.   3.  Environmental Conditions.  The environmental conditions in which the MMFF will operate are shown below in Table 3. Climate Types	Usage Hot	30% Basic	70% Table 1 4. Movement Terrain.  The AHS can be deployed over any terrain that the deploying vehicle can traverse.  The primary deployment vehicle for the AHS is the 5-ton cargo truck.  In addition to the 5-ton cargo truck, the AHS can be deployed by the HEMTT-LHS an d PLS when mounted on a flatrack.  The AHS shall be capable of deployment over the   following deployment terrain profile. Terrain	Usage                Primary Roads	20%                Secondary Roads	50%                Trail	15%                Cross Country	15% Table 2 OEM: LaBarge Products, Inc., ST. Louis, MO. Availability of TDP: The Army does not own a TDP, the system was procured according to PD# ATPD 2268, Dated 30 Oct 02.  Configuration Stability: System configuration is currently frozen pending results of Production Qualification Test. Fleet Assessment: The AHS is a new system currently in Full Rate Production (FRP). The initial quantities to be delivered are 34 systems in 2006 with anticipated quantity of 74 systems fielded thru 2011. G8 still owes us a distribution plan however they ha  ve indicated that the first units to be equipped are the Units of Action.  Useful Life of the AHS is 20 years. Annual Support Workload (Maintenance AMMS): Direct productive annual maintenance man-hours requirement by MOS for each level of maintenance to be performed by the gaining MACOM, are as follows: OCC-SPEC	UL	DS	GS 63B	       91.4    15.7      0 63J            200      150     200  Reliability 13 Mean Hours Between Essential Function Failure(MHBEFF): AHS Test and Evaluation Master Plan(TEMP) estimates the 350 gpm pump will require 200 hrs MHBEFF and the ERS will require 50 cycles MHBEFF. Depot Capability Current Workload?: None, system is currently in LRIP. Annual Sustainment Parts Cost: Life Cycle Cost Estimate states $34,800 per system for annual replenishment of spare replacements and consumables. Current Organic Support:   1.  Supply and Logistics Support: Support objectives for initial operational capability will be full organic support.  Interim contractor support for supply will be considered to expedite initial provisioning, if required.  Integrated prognostics/diagnosti  cs will be used to the maximum extent possible to reduce the maintenance burden based on operational concept and total life cycle cost. Supply support requirements will be generated from a detailed analysis of maintenance tasks that will  identify all resources required for system support.  Provisioning Technical Documentation will be used for the identification, selection, determination of initial requirements, and cataloging of support items to be procured thro ugh the provisioning proce ss.  The Logistics Support contractor will be required to develop a Supply Support Summary using data elements as specified in LMI data product worksheets.  The AHS IPT will review and approve the Spare Parts List and the Interim Support Items List.  The P rovisioning Data will permit NSN assignment, as required, and the procurement and stockage of high-demand items. Initial spares (Authorized Stockage List [ASL] and Prescribed Load List [PLL]) will be provided to gaining units and funded by PM PAWS.  Replenishment spares will be stocked according to demand, funded and requisitioned by the using activity. 2.  Maintenance Concepts: This procurement will utilize organic logistical support for the maintenance and servicing of the AHS and will conform to the requirements and guidance IAW AR 750-1 (Army Materiel Maintenance Policy) and DA PAM 738-750 (Functiona l Users Manual for The Army Maintenance Management System [TAMMS]). Maintenance will correspond to the Two-Level Maintenance System concept (Field and Sustainment).  Field includes operator preventative maintenance (C), unit maintenance (O) and some direct support maintenance (F).  Sustainment will also include some direct   support maintenance as well as all general support maintenance (H).  Field and Sustainment maintenance will be preformed using standard tools, test, measurement and diagnostic equipment.  No depot support is envisioned for the AHS.  A Preventative Mainte n ance Checks and Services (PMCS) and a Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) will be included in the system technical manual. The AHS will have a probability of completion of 1 day of retail and bulk fuel distribution operations as described in the operational mode summary/mission profile without the occurrence of an essential function failure (EFF) of at least R(EFF) = 0.80.  Th  e median time to repair (MedTTR) for all essential unscheduled maintenance demands (EUMD) will not exceed 1 hour.  The maximum time to repair for 90 percent of all EUMD (MAXTTR 90) will not exceed 2.5 hours.  3. Training and Training Devices:  The Materiel Developer will provide a complete training package that will support all phases of training for the AHS.  The Training Support Package (TSP) will be developed to support New Equipment (NET), Institutional and   Sustainment Training.  The system TSP will be designed and developed IAW U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Regulation 350-70 within the Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) database and will be concurrently developed with the syst em and delivered in draft to U.S. Army CASCOM, Training Directorate, System Integration Division, for review and approval.  The AHS System TSP will include electronic technical manuals (ETM), program of instruction, lesson plans, student and instructor gui d es and an instructional DTV (Distributive Training Vehicle) Web-based interactive multimedia package on the operation and maintenance of the AHS.  The DTV will be provided for use in sustainment training and to facilitate distance learning.  An embedded training capability will be considered. Instructor and key personnel training (I&KPT) will be provided for the initial transfer of information and training methods from the materiel developer to the trainer.  Distance learning will also be considered as a m ethod of providing NET. The AHS will be provided to the Quartermaster and Ordnance Maintenance Mechanical Schools for use in institutional training.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

After the vessel has been fabricated, the weld seams will be finished using per best practices or applicable American Vacuum Society (AVS) specifications.
**
All component parts of the chamber will be welded in accordance with the best practices of the American Welding Society.  
**
The openings into the vacuum chamber will require exceptional care in their design and fabrication.  It is also important that penetrations be designed so that each can be tested individually for leaks.  All flanged penetrations will be provided with "O" ring seals (viton).
**
Bulkhead panel through the chamber wall, shall have 24 shielded data lines for general purpose telemetry (BNC is preferred for the data signals).   All connection must comply with the same vacuum ratings as the rest of the chamber. Per best practices or applicable American Vacuum Society (AVS) specifications.
**
Bulkhead panel through the chamber wall shall have 4 pairs (±) power for both AC and DC, rated to 15 amps.  All connection must comply with the same vacuum ratings as the rest of the chamber.  Per best practices or applicable American Vacuum Society (AVS) specifications.
**
Careful designing and qualification of each type of weld joint used to insure that the tightest possible weld is made at each location. Per best practices or applicable American Vacuum Society (AVS) specifications.
**
One 6 inch view port at the back of the chamber is required
**
The chamber will have one door which will be hinged.  The door shall open wide enough to allow full extension of the platen to permitted mounting of the UUT.
**
LEAK DETECTION:

**
2.  Questions and Answers submitted after Amendment 4 posting:
**
A.  Question:  Do you still need the 16 channel temp chart recorder?  
Answer:  No.
**
B.  Question:  Do you still need 2 opening doors on the chamber?  
Answer:  Only one door is required per the minimum specifications
**
C.  Question:  We have been working on the quotation and have a problem. If we increase the internal working space, the exterior becomes so large that it would not pass through the doorways. Is there any alternative to getting it into the room, such as a large window?
Answer:  There are no windows in the room.  No alternative entry ways.  The doorway is 70.5 inches.
**
D.  I see they have added extra BNC penetrations 24 instead of 16). Have they eliminated the need for the 16 channel recorder as I do not see it listed on the new spec. The shelf platen control is now requested and probably better and more accurate. How far out of the chamber should the platen be able to extend, if this is what you are asking for?
Answer:  The requirements are 24 BNC penetrations.  The platen shall be fully extendable.  Submit quotations based upon the minimum specifications posted with Amendment 5.
**
E.  Question:  The new spec calls for all viton seals. Is this correct or are we allowed to use Cf flanges?
Answer:  No
**
3.  As a result, the closing date remains unchanged.  All quotations packages are due 11:30 a.m. EST on 19 April 2006.

<DESC>This Amendment is issued to answer questions in response to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation N00421-06-T-0083.  The closing date of 27 March 2006, is  extended through 31 March 2006, 3:30 PM EST.  If you have already submitted a proposal, you may submit revisions to the proposal or re-submit your proposal in its entirety.  The Contracting Officer for this procurement is Josephine A. Scully, phone (301) 995-8117 or e-mail:  josephine.scully@navy.mil.

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:    QUESTION 1. Section 3.13.1.1:  Does the FSK adhere to the Bell 103 Standard?   If not, which Bell standard does it adhere to? 

RESPONSE 1:  No.  The interface does not adhere to a published standard.  This is a specialized interface designed specifically to provide a means to store radar sweep information on a analog reel-to-reel tape recorder.

QUESTIONS 2, 3, & 4.  Section 3.13.1.1:  What are the various baud rates that must be met for the FSK input and FSK output?  What is the time duration that the various tones appear at the input of the FSK?  What is the time duration that the various tones need to appear at the output of the FSK?

RESPONSE 2, 3, & 4: The FSK signal in question is a frequency modulated square wave that operates with a selectable base carrier wave of 4.8KHz or 24 KHz. Please refer to http://www.ee.unb.ca/thesis97/ee4000u/Chapter4.htm for an example.  FS  FSK Interface.  The TTL/75ohm beacon target report messages received from the Video Signal Processor VSP (the VSP or the Magnetic Tape Recorder in the case of AATC) contain range, azimuth, identity codes, and coded barometric altitude.  The input data format consists of five 16 bit words plus an 8 bit parity check character.  The message is sent from the VSP to the SDC, serially, using a frequency shift keying (FSK) technique with a nominal data rate of either 4,800 (slow) or 24,000 (fast) bits per second.  The start of each 88 bit message is indicated by one cycle of either 2.4 kHz square wave (400 microsecond period) (slow) or 12 kHz square wave (80 microsecond period) (fast).  The binary value, ONE or ZERO, of each succeeding bit is indicated by one cycle of either 4.8 kHz (slow) or 24 kHz (fast) for a ZERO and by two cycles of either 9.6 kHz (slow) or 48 kHZ (fast) for a ONE.  The FSK receiver circuits accept the FSK data format and detect the binary value of each bit in the message.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 03 for Infant Security System for NMCSD.

QUESTION:
Which doors are to be secured by the Infant Security System for the patient elevators?


ANSWER:
On an elevator, there are two sets of doors: there are doors mounted on the elevator car (Inner doors, also called a Car Door), and there are doors that protect the elevator shaft (outer doors or entrance doors). 
 
If the inner doors on the car were to be locked, the elevator would not function normally on non-protected floors, contrary to the requirements of the solicitation.

The doors that enclose the elevator shaft (outer doors), and provide protection from smoke/fire spread, and prevent personnel from falling into the elevator shaft are the doors that should be secured.
 


The proposal due date and time remain unchanged. Proposals are due not later than 1630  (4:30 PM) local time (EST) on 29 March 2006.
