Installation Description:  Fort Knox is a U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command installation with the primary mission of training soldiers for the Armor Force.  The Armor School is the rock on which the Armor Center mission is built.  Its staff sections, directorates, and units provide the personnel, equipment, and guidance needed to train in the development of its doctrine. 

It is also home to the U.S. Army Recruiting Command and the 2nd Region ROTC and Readiness Group Knox.  The most well-known landmark at Fort Knox is the U.S. Bullion Depository, better known as the Gold Vault.  

Fort Knox is a certified Kentucky city, covering 109,054 acres or about 170.4 square miles.  It is the seventh largest urban community in the Commonwealth, with a day-time population of about 33,000.  Fort Knox is adjacent to the city of Radcliff, 15 miles north of Elizabethtown, and approximately 45 miles south of Louisville.

Additional installation information can be located at:  http://www.knox.army.mil/

Utility System to be privatized:  The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations:

Water Treatment and Distribution System

Fort Knox’s potable water utility system currently includes 13 groundwater wells, two surface impoundment structures, a low-lift pumping station, two water treatment plant (WTP) facilities, three clear wells, two high lift pump stations, one booster pump station (BPS), eight elevated storage tanks, and a potable water distribution system containing roughly 156 miles of potable water distribution pipe. 

Please note:  The current system inventory reflects roughly 156 miles of potable water distribution pipe.  The Government is currently in the process of updating the system inventory and will provide this information as an amendment to the solicitation.  The Government estimates that the updated inventory may include as much as 214 miles of potable water distribution line.

For purposes of this synopsis, Fort Knox’s potable water system has been divided into the following three components: (1) Raw Water Supply Sources, (2) Water Treatment Facilities, and (3) Potable Water Distribution and Storage:

1.  Raw Water Supply Sources

The raw water is currently taken from four primary sources:  Otter Creek, McCracken Spring, 13 Army-owned ground water wells and 3 leased ground water wells.  The Otter Creek and McCracken Spring facilities, located southwest of the main cantonment area, are the primary sources of water to the Central WTP.  Raw water from the West Point well field located north of the main cantonment area along the Ohio River can also be pumped to the Muldraugh WTP via a 24-inch cast iron line or a 14-inch ductile iron line leased by the Army from Hardin County Water District No. 1 (HCWD No. 1) to the Central WTP.  The Army’s 13 ground water wells and the 3 leased wells are the primary sources of raw water to the Muldraugh WTP.

A small impoundment and concrete dam structure below McCracken Spring provides surface water to the Otter Creek pumping station (OCPS, Facility No. 9213) via a gravity feed 16-inch cast iron line.  A small impoundment and concrete dam structure on Otter Creek also provides surface water to the OCPS.  The small impoundment and dam structures were constructed in the late 1930’s and have been dredged periodically over the subsequent years.  The OCPS, constructed in 1937, pumps the surface water withdrawn from McCracken Spring and Otter Creek to the Central WTP.  The OCPS includes an intake structure with mechanical screens, pump controls and telemetry, one 1,200 gpm (1.728 MGD) 150 HP, pump and two 2,100 gpm (3.024 MGD) pumps (one pump is 230 HP pump whereas the second pump is 250 HP), and a 550 kilowatt (kW) diesel emergency / standby generator.  The raw water lines from McCracken Spring to the OCPS and from the OCPS to the Central WTP are over 75 years old.

The Government’s 13 ground water wells and the 3 ground water wells leased by Fort Knox from HCWD No.1 are located in the West Point well field, north of the main cantonment area along the Ohio River, on land either owned by or leased by the Army.  The well field is a naturally formed alluvial aquifer bounded by the Ohio River, the Salt River and the inland hills. The raw water wells utilized either vertical turbine pumps on top of the wells or submersible pumps located with the well.  12 wells have pumps rated at 750 gpm (1.080 MGD), 125 HP and one of wells is rated at 500 gpm (0.720 MGD), 75 HP.  The 24-inch raw water line from the West Point well field to the Muldraugh WTP is over 75 years and may need to be considered for replacement in the next few years.

The Army has notified HCWD No. 1 that, in the event that the Installation’s potable water utility system is privatized, the Army may be terminating the lease of the three wells and the 14-inch raw line.  Upon termination of the lease, the three wells and 14-inch line will revert back to HCWD No.1.  As a result, these system components will not be included in the privatization action.

2.  Water Treatment Facilities

Fort Knox has two water treatment facilities:  the Central WTP facility and the Muldraugh WTP facility.  As the name indicates, the Central WTP is located in the central area of the main cantonment area.  The Muldraugh WTP is located on the northwestern side of the Installation, near the Town of Muldraugh, Kentucky.

The Central WTP facility (Facility No. 1205) was initially constructed in 1937, and has been partially upgraded numerous times over the years.  The primary source of raw water to the 3.5 MGD Central WTP is the surface water from the Otter Creek and McCracken Spring facilities, located southwest of the main cantonment area.  When surface water is not desirable for treatment, the ground water is pumped from the West Point well field to the main cantonment area on to the Central WTP via the leased 14-inch ductile iron line.

The Central WTP facility is a combination water softening and WTP facility.  The facility continues to produce a good quality finished-water.  Although the Central WTP is staffed over a period of 16 hours, the WTP facility is only operated roughly 6-12 hours per day.  The Central WTP is currently operated to produce finished water with chlorine residual reading in the range of 1.8 to 2.9 TAP, pH reading in the range of 8.4 to 8.8 TAP, hardness reading in the range of 100 to 110 parts per million (ppm) and fluoride in the range of 1.0 to 1.2 ppm.  Should the potable water utility system be privatized, the UP Contractor will be required to operate the Central WTP in a manner that the finished water meets these levels.

The Muldraugh WTP facility (Facility No. 3009) was initially constructed in 1941, and has been partially upgraded numerous times over the years. The primary source of raw water to the 7.0 MGD Muldraugh WTP is the ground water pumped from the Army’s 13 wells and the three leased wells in the West Point well field, located north along the Ohio River. The ground water from the wells is pumped roughly 3 miles to the Muldraugh WTP via a 24-inch cast iron line.

The Muldraugh WTP facility is also a combination water softening and WTP.  The facility continues to produce a good quality finished-water, in spite of the deteriorating equipment and facility.  This is likely due to the fact that the Muldraugh WTP is generally operated at roughly 2.5 MGD, or 36 percent of the WTP’s design capacity of 7.0 MGD.  Although the Muldraugh WTP operates around the clock, 24 hours per day / 365 days per year, the WTP facility is only staffed roughly 16 hours per day.  The Muldraugh WTP is also currently operated to produce finished water with chlorine residual reading in the range of 1.8 to 2.9 TAP, pH reading in the range of 8.4 to 8.8 TAP, hardness reading in the range of 100 to 110 ppm and fluoride in the range of 1.0 to 1.2 ppm.  Should the potable water utility system be privatized and the Muldraugh WTP still be in operation, the UP Contractor will be required to operate the WTP facility in a manner that the finished water meets these levels. 

3.  Potable Water Distribution and Storage

The water distribution system transports the finished water from the two WTP facilities to the various facilities located throughout the Installation.  The system provides domestic, industrial and fire protection throughout the Installation.  The distribution system consists of pipes, valves, meters, fire hydrants, water storage tanks and the BPS.  The distribution system piping includes mains, service lines and fire lines with known sizes ranging from less than 6-inches to 24-inches in diameter.  The distribution pipe includes polyvinyl chloride, cast iron, ductile iron, and asbestos concrete.  The majority of the water distribution pipe was installed prior to 1950.

Fort Knox’s potable water utility system includes one BPS located in the Van Voorhis Housing area, which was constructed in 1995.  The Van Voorhis BPS (Facility No. 5898) includes three 175 gpm, 10 HP pumps and one diesel driven 2,000 gpm, 125 HP fire protection pump.

Eight elevated storage tanks support Fort Knox’s potable water distribution system.  The combined capacity of the storage tanks is approximately 3.550 million gallons.

<DESC><p>The Air Armament Center, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron is contemplating a sole source award to CSC, 780 S.W. Long Lake Ct, Palm City, FL, 34990. It is intended that the award be made to support on-going Network Enabled Weapons (NEW) program in Combat Net Radio (CNR) and is anticipated to be awarded in April 2008. The contractor will review Modeling and Simulations provided by the Government from a separate ongoing Combat Net Radio contract. The offeror must provide the following: expertise in Combat Net Radio (CNR) and CNR standards (e.g. MIL-STD-188-220 and MIL-STD-2045-47001), message standards, CNR Modeling and Simulation, CNR Timing Parameters, Network Planning, etc. NEW is breaking new ground in the need for near real time networking using MIL-STD-188-220D and the personnel assigned to support this effort must possess detailed technical knowledge of MIL-STD-188-220, automation within the 188-220 network, and application in near real time operations. This requirement can only be met by CSC because they have the expertise required for this program and is the only company with the necessary technical and operational experience with the CNR standards, automation of the network, near real time operations and the CNR Timing Parameters. CSC personnel have also been heavily involved in the preparation of the Interface Control Documentation (ICDs) that define actual implementations that follow the CNR standards. They have also been involved in producing the variations (options) within the standards that are specifically needed for the NEW networks. The offeror must be currently qualified to provide all capabilities cited. A firm fixed price type purchase order is contemplated. It is estimated that the purchase order will have a period of performance of 3 months. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the points of contact identified below. The AAC Ombudsman is BGen Michael N. Wilson, AAC/CV, (850) 882-5422, or michael.wilson2@eglin.af.mil. For further information concerning technical aspects, contact Lt Ricardo Malave, (850) 883-3838 or e-mail ricardo.malave@eglin.af.mil or Mark Brock, (850) 883-3632 or e-mail mark.brock@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>C2IS is planned as a "virtual integrated temporal relational database" of air operations data accessible through Web services with minimal degradation in Disconnected, Interrupted, and Low-bandwidth (DIL) operations and with continuity of operations (COOP) despite software, hardware, or network failures and damage.  C2IS will be the data-services component of the Command and Control Air and Space Operations Suite (C2AOS).  C2AOS will transition Theater Battle Management Core Systems Force Level (TBMCS FL) capabilities to a Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) environment.  C2IS is planned to be developed as one or more capability packages.  The first projected stage of C2IS is the Air Resource Information Services (ARIS) component.
C2IS is planned to be a virtual database.  That is, it may or may not be implemented as a single database, and may also access and manipulate databases provided by other software modules.  It will be integrated and temporal, allowing users to retrieve and manipulate data related to development and execution, including planning, publication, and execution of air tasking orders (ATO).  C2IS will be relational to the extent that the term "relational" in this phrase does not carry its technical meaning of a database composed of tables, but rather that objects can be retrieved through links to other objects.  ARIS is anticipated to be the component of C2IS that manages air-resource data, also referred to as Friendly Order of Battle (FrOB) data.  The initial risk-reduction effort of ARIS is planned to be used in tests and experiments, but is not planned for operational fielding.
The government anticipates C2IS ARIS objectives to include identifying potential performance issues and supporting evaluation of operational and technical approaches for compliance with architecture standards defined by NECC and using Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) core services.  It will support Web service definitions, a data environment structured to work within an SOA framework, and vocabularies and data models developed by Communities of Interest (COIs) such as the Time-Sensitive Targeting, Air Operations, and Strike COIs.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for providing scientific, engineering,technical, and documentation support for the various areas of researchand technology development work within, but not limited to, the ScienceDirectorate at NASA ARC. 
 NASA/ARC intends to acquire the services from the current contractor,Enterprise Advisory Services, Inc. (EASI), for six months as anextension to the current contract, NAS2-02091. The extension will beginon June 1, 2008 and end on November 30, 2008. The extension is in theGovernment's best interest to provide ongoing scientific, engineering,technical, and documentation support until a new contract is awarded.The current contractor has successfully provided support to thestrategic objectives of NASA in the areas of Life Sciences research andCrew Exploration, and is critically involved with on-going strategicinitiatives that would be adversely impacted without their continuedsupport.   
 Additionally, competing the requirement for six-month term would not bepossible given the end date of the current contract and the requirementfor uninterrupted service.  Awarding the six-month contract to anothercontractor would not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, therebyaffecting the seamless continuity of services provided to the Center.  
 The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FARPart 12.  See Note 26. 
 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort in electronically via e-mail to thecontract specialist, Ms. Robin Wong, at Robin.L.Wong@nasa.gov not laterthan 4:30 p.m. local time on Thursday, April 17, 2008.  Suchcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitivebasis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposedeffort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses tothis notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. 
 Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for Stainless Steel In-Line Particulate Filters, which includes the following: 440 micron mesh with Swagelok Tube Fittings. 
 NASA/ARC intends to purchase these items from Swagelok Sunnyvale, located at 929 Weddel Ct., Sunnyvale California, 94089, because they are the sole-proprietary manufacture of the requested filters.  These are Stainless Steel In-Line Particulate Filter, 440 micron mesh, with Swagelok Tube Fittings, which will be used in the Arc Jet Complex.  The requested filters are the only filters that come stock with Swagelok fittings, thus requiring no additional fitting conversions.  These Swagelok filters use Swagelok fittings that consist of a nut, furral, gland that is not interchangeable with other manufactures of swaged fittings.  Swagelok is a proprietary feral-compression fitting that cannot be interchanged with other types of feral-compression fittings.   
 The filters will be used on the de-ionized cooling water system of the Interaction Heating Facility (IHF).   With the installation of a new high pressure pumping system for the IHF and water passages decreased in size to increase velocity/cooling in the arc heater column, particulate contamination of the cooling system has become an issue.  These filters will strain the de-ionized water system of particulates thus preventing the cooling water passages in the arc heater column from getting blocked.  This will prevent arc heater failure due to segment overheating.   Currently the cooling water passages vary in size from .055 (inches) to .070 (inches) There are approximately 450 de-ionized cooling water supply lines feeding the heater, each of which requires an in-line filter. 
 The filters shall have the following requirements: 
 *	Inline design required due to space limitations (see picture below) *	Connect to 3/8" hose *	Working pressure of system - 1200 (psi)  *	Swagelok or 37°-AN fittings required to mate-up to existing hoses *	Fast field change of filter element required (i.e. hose to remain in place) *	Variable filter (strainer or sintered) size, currently requesting 440 [µm] 
 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. 
 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 7, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to set-aside for a small business concern the purchase of an updated patient education video describing the risk and benefits of ACAM2000 vaccine. In the aftermath of the anthrax attacks of 2001, efforts were undertaken to prepare a response for various bioterrorism agents. Because smallpox had been eradicated, the only vaccines available were no longer licensed and would have to be given as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol. However, if there was a need to conduct mass vaccination clinics in a short time, videos would be required in order to more quickly impart the risks and benefits of the vaccine under the terms of the IND. In 2003, a production company was hired to create these videos. They were distributed to all public health agencies in the United States to be used in the event of a smallpox attack. In 2007, a new smallpox vaccine was licensed. While it will no longer require the amount of information as the IND product, public health agencies still need a way to easily explain the risks and benefits of the vaccine in the event mass vaccination is required. This contract is to hire a production company to create a new version of this patient education video. The full solicitation document shall be uploaded within 24 hours and it is your responsibility to retrieve the solicitation from herein, thereafter. The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted or entertained. No questions will be questions will be answered via telephone. No hard copy of the solicitation package will be mailed. Questions from vendors shall be e-mail to me no later than 72 hours after the solicitation is uploaded to Fedbizopps. Answers to questions shall be posted on Fedbizopps within 48 hours of the expiration of the time allocated for vendor questions. All responsible small businesses may submit a proposal for consideration. The associated NAICS codes is 512110. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFQ on the Fedbizopps Website Offers will be due 4/18/2008 by 5:00 P.M.

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Offerors will be evaluated on a pass or fail basis to determine whether the proposed pre-packed kit items meet the salient characteristics of that brand name. Award will be made on the basis of determining the offeror with the lowest evaluated price and whose proposal passed the salient characteristics required of the pre-packed kit items.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, <br />Tara Petersen<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: tara.petersen@usafa.af.mil</p>

Support period: Jan 23 2008 - Sept 30 2008.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system. These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite. As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset.The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line. Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.<BR><BR>The BMC Remedy ITSM suite has been in use in DO since August 2005. Internal and external groups utilize this system to inform and resolve problem areas and to manage the process of issue resolution. Prior to last August, the programs used by DO to track trouble tickets and assets had traditionally been customized, internally developed applications. Based on many analyses, DO moved from the custom application to an “out-of-the-box” solution that leverages industry standards and realigned business processes with industry best practices. It has been recommended, based on a cost-benefit analysis, to configure a development environment for:• Conducting development efforts• Testing developed products• Compatibility testing• Use case scenario testing• Infrastructure change testing and evaluation• Training• DemonstrationsThe project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server. It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC. These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed. Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the system’s current state. Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment. The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible. Changes made in the development environment can be:• Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes• Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conductedSeparating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice. The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DO’s Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded.<BR><BR>

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST). This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s KCC project needs. The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options:• Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management• Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health• Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks• Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives• Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers• Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities)• CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting• 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives• Systems must have front video/USB ports• Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources• Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.The requested HP server fulfills the following critical requirements:• The server must utilize Intel’s quad-core 5400 series processors that generate no more than 80 watt of heat. The processors shall operate at a minimum of 3.0GHz and employ a 1333 MHz FSB. There are Intel quad-core processors that generate 100 and 120 watts, but they exceed our maximum heat threshold. Note: If Intel’s 50 watt Quad Core processors are available at the time of purchase, then the 50 watt processor will supersede our original 80 watt requirement, and be the preferred choice.• The server form factor must not be greater than 2U• The server must support a minimum of (8) internal 2.5 inch SAS hard drives• Servers must be configured with 16Gb of memory and have the ability to expand to 32Gb without discarding original memory• Server power supplies must be rated by the manufacture at a minimum of 800 watts.• The vendor must be able to provide emergency maintenance within a 4-hour response time, 24/7CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration. The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline. The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.(5) A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated<BR><BR>

The hardware solution above was analyzed and tested for interoperability against other solution sets with existing Department of State enterprise hardware and proved to be both the best technical solution and value. All testing was based on predetermined Department requirements. Wholesale changes in equipment type will result in large risks to the Department due to lengthy retesting, configuration, and de  sign. The department will also not realize a Return on investment in this product which will lead to a non standardized environment for a solution that requires cross platform consistency. Additionally, Changes in design will place unnecessary risk to the Department in the deployment of disaster recovery sets due to the lengthy process of placing new equipment on the ITCCB approved equipment list for enterprise use.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed above as the only suitable candidate available in the market today meeting Department's requirements regarding cost, capacity, performance, scalability, packaging and durability as well as ease of use in the backup model described above. Furthermore, the equipment is listed on the IRM ITCCB approved hardware list. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software will place the Department at risk and will cause unacceptable delays to   the Programs schedule in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh efforts. Additionally, storage arrays use vendor specific operating systems. Changing to another product of similar hardware specifications will put the Department at risk due to documentation, integration, configuration, and installation process change requirements. GITM Procurement requires the brand name equipment listed above in (2) to be procured on a brand name only basis. Brand name only acquisition is permitted when justified as essential to meeting the Government Requirements by FAR 11.105. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system. Although the requirement is restricted to brand name only, AQM will post the r  equirement on FedBid and will included the brand name justification with the posting. The requirement will be competed on FedBid amongst Federal Supply Schedule Holders in compliance with FAR 8.405-6. The requirement will be set-aside for GSA schedule holders only. GSA has already determined the prices to be fair and reasonable. The Government will award a delivery order to the offer that represents the overall the best value. After extensive testing of nine storage solutions (FilesX Xpress Restore Repository Testing Results version 1.0, December 14, 2006), the JetStor 412/416 storage arrays were the only arrays found to be compatible with the Departments existing hardware and software.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge is a 575,000 acre high desert, sage steppe area located in northwestern Nevada.  The Refuge Headquarters are located 25 miles west of Denio.  Refuge elevations range from 4,200 feet to 7,200 feet.
The purpose of this work is to build 5.1 miles of SNWR boundary fence located on McGee Mountain.  Segment E1(a)Coordinates for the staring point are 41.792445, 118.973514.  Ending point coordinates are 41.740109, 118.944296.  Coordinates are in NAD83.  This portion of the boundary has never been fenced but it has been surveyed recently and land monuments exist at most section corners. The fence will go through varying topography including rock outcroppings.   
The purpose of this work is to build 5.1 miles of SNWR boundary fence located on McGee Mountain.  Segment E1(b) Coordinates for the staring point are 41.792445, 118.973514.  Ending point coordinates are 41.740109, 118.944296.  Coordinates are in NAD83.  This portion of the boundary has never been fenced but it has been surveyed recently and land monuments exist at most section corners. The fence will go through varying topography including rock outcroppings.
The Purpose of this work is to build 4.7 miles of SNWR boundary fence located on the northern boundary in the Big Spring Table area.  Coordinates for the western point are 41.993421, 118.97025.  Eastern point coordinates are 41.992872, 118.878911.  Coordinates are in NAD83.  This portion of the boundary has never been fenced but it has been surveyed recently and land monuments exist at most section corners.  A portion of the fence cannot follow the true boundary due to a rocky rim.  That portion will have to be placed on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land as close to the edge of the rim as possible.  An agreement with the Lakeview District of the BLM has been completed.  The fence will be relatively flat terrain; however the ground is very rocky and will be difficult to sink fence posts in.  Rock drills may be required to set posts in those areas.   
The fencing is to be constructed in remote areas of the Refuge. This will add several considerations to the level of difficulty and tasks that may be associated with the actual fence building.  Complicating issues related to the fence construction, but which may not be inclusive of all variables encountered are: 
Variable soil substrates including rockVarying degrees of accessibilityUneven terrain Steep slopes Cross-country foot travel packing heavy, bulky fence materialsLimited vehicle accessInclement weatherInsect and/or wildlife hazards
The Contractor shall conform to all restrictions that may be imposed in response to wildfire danger and Industrial Fire Precaution Levels.  The Contractor is responsible for contacting Refuge Headquarters to become informed of changes in fire precaution levels.  The Refuge will supply all fencing materials at approximately $3,500.00/mile.
The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards using Best Value to include past performance, expereience and price as the evaluation criteria.  NAICS 238990, Hub Zone Preference.Estimated RFP release date April 14th, 2008.  Please check www.fbo.gov for solicitation package before calling with questions.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Government of Ontario, Canada using simplified acquisition procedures for helicopter services, including pilot and fuel, to support the annual Waterfowl Breeding Pair Population Survey.  This survey is conducted to fulfill the United State's obligations toward International Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  Waterfowl breeding populations will be surveyed within Ontario, Quebec and Labrador Canada to count waterfowl and collect data.   The flight surveys are to be conducted between May 15, 2008, and June 6, 2008, depending on weather conditions.  Because the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources is a government agency, their helicopters are able to access jet fuel caches which are reserved for Government aircraft in remote areas.  Estimated number of hours to conduct this survey is 50 hours.  The helicopter flights are to be conducted in Stratum 51 in Ontario and Strata 68 and 69 in Quebec and Labrador, Canada. The survey and identification project require maneuvering the helicopter at the edge of the performance envelope in a variety of remote wilderness habitats in northern Canada.  See Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for analytical support forComputational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling of reduced gravity pressurecontrol concepts for liquid hydrogen, oxygen, and methane propellants. 
 NASA/MSFC intends to acquire this research effort from The BoeingCompany.  The overall procurement objective is to utilize CFD modelingto evaluate the performance of various thermodynamic vent system (TVS)configurations when applied to low gravity cryogenic propellant storagesubsystems. CFD modeling techniques will be used to simulate the complexeffects of reduced gravity on pressure control for cryogenics providedthe techniques are "anchored" with existing TVS test data. Boeing is inthe unique position of having designed, built, and evaluated the TVShardware tested at MSFC.  
 This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implementsthe authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisitions of supplies orservices from only one source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements. 
 The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FARPart 12.  See Note 26. 
 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 17, 2008.

<a href="mailto:Lizette.M.Kummer@nasa.gov">Lizette M Kummer</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for continued support of theHuntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC).  The HOSC providesmulti-program facilities, systems and services, both local and remote,which support various mission phases of spacecraft payload and Shuttlepropulsion systems operations. The HOSC capability supports all phasesof missions including planning, testing, simulations, pre-launch,launch, and all aspects of payload flight operations. The HOSC missionis to provide operations and maintenance (O&M) and system developmentservices to meet International Space Station Program (ISS), SpaceShuttle (SSP), and other program/project requirements.    
 NASA/MSFC intends to purchase these services from COLSA Corporationover a two year extension period. This recommendation is made pursuantto FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and noother supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 
 1.  The extension of the COLSA contract will promote retention ofcritical Space Shuttle Program (SSP) workforce through the end of theprogram, will allow for a continued cross utilization of resourcesacross programs, and will provide seamless operations support for theInternational Space Station (ISS) program.  A contract extension withCOLSA through Shuttle retirement will aid in workforce retention andvendor-base stability during the transition from Shuttle toConstellation, helping mitigate any impacts to a program philosophy of"last flight as safe as first flight." Failure to maintain a stable andcontinuous HOSC support workforce could have severe and serious impactsto the safety of the SSP and ISS Programs, and the success of theConstellation Program. 
 2.  COLSA has been the HOSC support contractor since winning thecontract competition in 2004, providing them with a unique and intimateknowledge of operations, capabilities, requirements, and processes. TheCOLSA workforce has critical skills that need to be utilized foranticipated changes in requirements necessary to support completion ofthe ISS.  The remaining Shuttle flights will accomplish the addition ofthe European and Japanese Science Modules, which will result insignificant increases to the operational interface responsibilities, acomprehensive ISS Rack Relocation Plan, and an increase in ISS crewcapability.  Completion of the ISS, including these associated efforts,was scheduled to occur within the current period of performance but wasdelayed as a result of the 2003 Columbia accident.  An extension of theCOLSA contract will allow uninterrupted support through ISS completionand provide more stability during a time of significant requirementchanges.  A r  ecompetition of the HOSC effort prior to completion of the ISS wouldresult in some amount of attrition which would introduce schedule andcost risk to the ISS Program.  
 3.  The Marshall Space Flight Center is working closely with theConstellation program to develop launch and mission support requirementsfor the Ares and Orion vehicles.  The launch and mission operationsrequirements definition/development activity will not be fully engageduntil the Ares I-X test flight, currently scheduled for April 2009. Anextension of the COLSA contract would allow the maturity of thoserequirements to occur in advance of any operational or strategicdecisions, which could affect the potential placement of Ares/Orionlaunch and mission support requirements in the follow-on HOSC supportcontract. 
 Pursuant to NFS 1804.570, this proposed contract action will bepublished on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) and pursuantto FAR 5.201, this proposed contract action will be synopsized in theFederal Business Opportunities.  The results received in writing will beadded to this document by addendum. 
 The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FARPart 12.  See Note 26. 
 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 14, 2008.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric distribution system for the Channel Islands Air National Guard Station (ANGS) located in Port Hueneme,California, to Southern California Edison Company (SCEC). Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  The SCEC (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows: The 146th Airlift Wing (AW) of the California Air National Guard occupies 206 acres of fee-owned land adjacent to the Point Mugu Naval Air Station, an active duty Navy flying installation.  The Channel Islands ANG Station is located 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles in Port Hueneme, California.  The mission of the 146th AW is to provide global military airliftcapability to a full spectrum of state and federal agencies.  The unit currently flies the C-130 Hercules.  The 146th AW occupies two administrative, nine industrial, and four services buildings totaling approximately 345,191 square feet with 354 full-time personnel.  A unit training drill is conducted once a month and results in a surge of up to a total of 1,204 personnel.  Power is provided by Southern California Edison Company (SCEC) and enters the base at one location.  It is delivered and distributed at 16.5 kV through an underground radially configured system. The primary distribution system consists of approximately 10,700 linear feet of 3-phase, 3-wire underground circuits rated at 25 kV and 10,700 linear feet of 600 V ground wire. The underground circuits are in multiple conduit ductbanks buried at an average depth of 18 inches and are not marked with tracer wire. The ductbanks vary in number of conduits from two to twelve and conduit diameter ranges from two to five inches.  Multiple branches feed eleven 3-phase pad mounted transformers ranging from 75 to 750 kVA. The system includes 37 manholes, one main switchgear, two switchgear panels, twelve breakers, ten fuses, ten surge arrestors, and three meters. Base personnel indicate the capacity of the current system is adequate for present and future needs. Competitive proposals were requested in 2002 and no offers were received.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the system; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>Interested sources shall contact MSgt Jon D.

<SUBJECT>AVL TOXIC SAMPLER SYSTEM (TS-SYSTEM) UPGRADE
<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-08-00063
<RESPDATE>041608
<CONTACT>David E. Boris, Phone (513) 487-2158, Email boris.david@epa.gov
<DESC><p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office Acquisition Management (OAM) Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with AVL North America, Inc. The applicable NAICS code is <strong>334516</strong>.</p>
<p>This is an acquisition for the need to upgrade a piece of existing EPA test equipment. This equipment, a toxic sampler, was originally designed by AVL through a competitive contract, and built as a unique prototype consisting of proprietary AVL components and software. The Upgrade is to consist of the following:</p>
<p>1) The contractor shall propose an upgrade to the existing Toxic Sampler System (TSS) to allow for proportional flow sampling during transient tests. This will require the system to quickly and accurately change sample flow rates over a wide dynamic range - from 1 to 350 LPM - in order to maintain flow proportionality at all times. This is a much wider operating range than can be quickly and accurately controlled by the currently installed sample pump (10 - 230 LPM) and flow control system. Therefore this work shall require the contractor to replace the current pump with a larger pump that is capable of pulling 350 LPM. EPA suggests that a bypass valve and mixing tee to be installed at a point downstream of the outlet of the XAD assembly. Using this bypass system, the total system flow (which if the sum of the sample and bypass flows) remains fixed. The bypass flow path allows room air to enter the system, flow through the bypass valve, and combine with the sample flow in the mixing tee. This bypass air, controlled by a fast acting bypass valve, shall indirectly control sample flow rate through the XAD module to provide flow control across the dynamic range of the instrument. The contractor shall comment on the feasibility of this approach and provide recommendations for a more cost effective method for meeting the performance specifications outlined below. The contractor shall provide a detailed recommendation of the hardware and software modifications required to meet EPA's sampling needs, and provide a detailed cost breakdown for this work.</p>
<p>2) The contractor shall modify or reconfigure the sample flow path to enable positioning and mounting of the sample probe in the exhaust stream of a light duty vehicle testing on a chassis dynamometer. All changes in the physical orientation of the TSS shall be designed to minimize the deposition or alteration of the sampled aerosol.</p>
<p>a. The system shall be able to accommodate varying heights in tailpipe location due to the variability of this feature in light duty cars and trucks. The flexibility inherent in accommodating varying levels of sampling probe attachment height will make this system both vehicle-independent as well as test site-independent.</p>
<p>3) Validate sample proportionality over a light-duty UDDS vehicle test, an LA92 vehicle test, and a US06 vehicle test using the criteria established in 40CFR1065.545(a). The vehicle selected for validation testing shall be a vehicle selected from the LDT4 or MDPV weight categories.</p>
<p>4) The specifications for the current system indicate that the original components (solenoid valves and sample pump) were sized to accommodate an expected pressure drop in the system of 200 mBar. The contractor shall validate the system once any changes are made to verify that the pressure drop at full flow does not exceed the design specifications of any system components.</p>
<p>5) The contractor shall provide a written justification for each proposed modification to the existing system, including a detailed cost estimate for the modification of each component or subsystem. In each written justification, the contractor shall demonstrate the inadequacy of the current system or components therein to meet the new performance requirements outlined here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All remaining equipment specifications not mentioned above (heated line temperatures, chiller design, XAD module volume, etc) shall remain unchanged from the original TSS scope of work, and the contractor shall ensure that the proposed upgrade does not compromise the attainment of these specifications. The contractor shall comment on the need to upgrade additional components of the system not addressed here if failure to upgrade these opponents would result in improper operation, poor quality control, or otherwise limit the ability of the upgraded TSS system to meet the performance specifications of this performance work statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is not a request for proposal. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 10 days of the posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. The applicable NAICS code is 334516. Please submit your request in writing to David Boris at 26 W. Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH, 45268 or fax your request to (513) 487-2109. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

<DESC><p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) "Soliciting from a Single Source" with Accellos, Inc., 90 S. Cascade Ave, #1200, Colorado Springs, CO 80903. SSA requires enhancements to the existing application as well as the creation of new reports and features for Radio Beacon WMS software currently installed and in use as follows: at 6301 Security Blvd, Baltimore, MD and at 5107 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church. Accellos produced the Online Supply Ordering System and the source code for the software is proprietary. Accellos is the only company with the knowledge, skills, and access to the source code to make the modifications to the software. In Baltimore, the software solution provides the logistics support for SSA's supply management, customer ordering, and warehouse operations.

<a href="mailto:perrys2@ria.army.mil">TACOM - Rock Island</a>
<DESC>NA Estimated draft solicitation issue date is August 5, 2002.  Estimated closing date of draft solicitation is August 20, 2002.  Estimated final solicitation issue date is September 10, 2002. Estimated final solicitation closing date is October 10, 2002.  The  U.S. Army is in the process of modernizing all Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs).  Each SKO consists of a wide variety of tools and equipment essential to providing support to the Army’s inventory of technologically advanced tactical and combat support weapon  systems to meet the Army’s Ordnance and Combat missions.  This process is incremental.  With the completion of each redesign, each SKO will be procured and fielded. The Army is soliciting proposals from large and small businesses to establish long-term Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contracts for various tool sets, kits and outfits (SK0s).  It is the Army’s intent to make multiple awards under this solic itation to both large and small businesses.  Individual delivery orders will be competed among all awardees unless it is determined that a specific delivery order should be competed exclusively among small business awardees.  The Army will follow the Feder al Acquisition Regulation's  “rule of two” in determining whether a specific delivery order is to be competed among small business awardees (See FAR 19.502(b)). SKO's are defined as:   	Sets:  a collection of tools/components used by a group, section, squad, platoon or unit usually supplemented by tool kits to perform an organizational mission. Unit of issue of Set (SE) 	Kits:  An assembly of tools/components in a small pouch or box designed for use and carried by an individual or crew. Unit of issue of Kit (KT) 	Outfits: An assemblage of tools or equipment.  May include separately type-classified items as a component such as: Pneumatic Tool and Compressor Outfit, Water Purification Outfit, Tool Outfit Hydraulic Systems Repair and Tool Outfit Pioneer Portable Elec tric Tools. Unit of issue of Outfit (OT). For your information, Army Tools are defined as an instrument, implement, utensil, device or machine, powered or hand operated, used in diagnosis, making operating adjustments, performing damage or fault repair and preventive maintenance of Army material. In order to promote competition this requirement has been divided into the following segments: 1. Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 2. Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a  single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 3. Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be housed  in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 4. Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit i n a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components o f a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 5. Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its “carrier” by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Each segment will be individually competed and awarded.  The Army intends to establish two award pools for each segment: one will be created under full and open competition and the other will be for small business concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments.  Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical, performance risk and price proposal based on a sample SKO requirement.  The Army reserves the right to issue a delivery order on the sample SKO proposals.  The Army further reserves the right to issue an order under the award pool established under full and open competition or the award pool of small business concerns, depending upon proposals received. Small business concerns may compete for the award pool to be established under full and open competition and the pool to be established exclusively for small business concerns.  Small business concerns may submit alternative proposals based on meeting or n ot meeting the non-manufacturers rule (see 13 CFR 121.406).  Proposals based on meeting the non-manufacturers rule must be supported by adequate documentation. Offerors not receiving an award to be included in a pool of awardees will be debriefed and will have an opportunity to file a protest.   In the event that a requirement for a delivery order is competed exclusively among small businesses and only one offeror meets the nonmanufacturing rule, the contracting officer will issue the order to that offeror provided the price is fair and reasonable  and all other technical and past performance considerations are met.  The contracting officer will substantiate any determination regarding whether a price is fair and reasonable and will not consider a courtesy offer from a large business unless the cont racting officer determines that the small business offer is unreasonable.  In the event that the small business offer is unreasonable, the contracting officer may cancel the competition and compete the requirement among the full and open pool of awardees.  Finally, a small business who is otherwise eligible for award may apply for a COC if the contracting officer determines that the small business is unable to meet the nonmanufacturers rule.

<DESC>Mobile District intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Doble Engineering Company for the lease of the following:  1.  M4000 Insulation Analyzer, one type M4000 test set with a capacity of 300 milliamperes at voltages from 2 to 12 kv, 60 Hertz, suitable for testing bushings, potheads, buswork, disconnect insulators, circuit breakers, instrument transformers, power transformers, lightning arresters, generator stator insulation, coupling capacitors, insulating liquid and askarels, and short lengths of station cables.   2.  M4110 Leakage Reactance Interface. 3.  Doble Test Assistant; 4.  M3000 Transport; 5.  Laboratory Analytical Services; 6.  SFRA Consulting Service.  The set will be used by the Hydropower Test Unit at West Point, Georgia as anaid in providing periodic maintenance of hydroelectric power projects.  The lease shall be for a period of one year.  The proposed contract action is for services which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under authority of FAR6.302-1.  Doble Engineering Company has been found to be the only company that can provide test equipment on a rental basis as well as provide engineering services on an as needed basis.  Leasing is more advantageous than purchasing the equipment because the Government obtains state of the art equipment as it comes available via the modification of the contract for upgrading equipment.  Doble also has the expertise for storage of data and provides the services of a Doble engineer for instructional purposes.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal.  However, the government will consider all proposals received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received is solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Projected application growth areas include Full Motion Video, Map and Imagery dissemination, and large-volume data replication and backup.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently, transport acceleration exists in the SOF Deployable Node (SDN) family of satellite communications terminals (SDN-Lite, SDN-Medium, and SDN-Heavy) supporting SOF deployable forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Current accelerators in use are the ViaSat xPEP and the AOS SkyPipe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The performance of the existing devices will be the baseline used when comparing candidate hardware or software solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Interested vendors should identify their solutions for transport acceleration, application acceleration, or a combination as it would apply to SATCOM communications used in the tactical environment and to an enterprise &lsquo;garrison' environment. In response to this RFI, we ask that respondents submit written responses, preferably via electronic mail, and be willing to provide a demonstration device and/or software for evaluation. Written responses to this RFI should not exceed five (5) pages. However, you are reminded that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although we intend to use this information for future acquisition planning purposes, we will not release any information about your approach that might in any way compromise your competitive posture or proprietary information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor, will we use any information you provide us to level your approach relative to another competitor.</span></p>

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the water distribution system at Fort Knox, KY.  Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.
In conjunction with the conveyance of the systems, the Contractor will be required to provide utility services, including improvements, upgrades, repairs, expansions, investments, and plant replacement, as well as continued operation and maintenance of the utility distribution systems.  Additionally, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental services for the conveyed systems.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter 'Notice') is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm on Friday, February 29, 2008.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

<SUBJECT>Composition System Replacement
<SOLNBR>GPO08004
<RESPDATE>052308
<CONTACT>ArzaGardner, Director, Complex Acqusitions and Special Projects, Phone 202-512-1488, Fax 202-512-1354, Email agardner@gpo.gov - Cynthia D. Washington, Phone 202-512-1767, Email cdwashington@gpo.gov
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for market research, budgetary and planning purposes only! 

The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is establishing a composition system designed to replace its current composition system. The existing system is focused around a legacy batch composition engine, Microcomp. Microcomp is a composition program that specifically addresses key challenges in the production of Congressional publications. An estimated 700 related applications and utilities have been developed over the years to sustain and enhance Microcomp in order to support the evolving needs of GPO’s Congressional customers, in-house print and electronic access. Microcomp is currently used to compose the majority of Congressional documents produced by GPO as well as key Executive agency publications. These products are printed and disseminated electronically by GPO. The opportunity expressed in this RFI is referred to as the Composition System Replacement (CSR) and is envisioned as a replacement to and improvement of the current functionality provided by Microcomp.

The envisioned CSR system will be aligned with GPO’s Strategic Vision for the 21st Century and the agency’s Enterprise Architecture (EA). It will also integrate with evolving enterprise architecture in order to automate many content lifecycle processes, back office functions, and delivery of the content in formats suited to the needs of GPO customers. The system will be rules based to facilitate the migration of content into future data tagging schemes/technologies, while utilizing industry best practices. CSR must use the typographic style and page layout of current printed publications as well as support enhanced search, retrieval, data formats, and repurposing of data.

GPO is requesting industry assessment of our documentation as well as information to determine the capabilities of vendors to provide some or all of the services required for CSR, including master integrator and individual solution sets. This information will be used to revise, if necessary, our Requirements and Concept documentation, Implementation Plan and Acquisition Strategy in order to deliver a world-class composition system.

Background

GPO is the Federal Government’s primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, and preserving published U.S. Government information in all its forms. Since its inception, under the authority of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO has provided all three branches of the federal government with a set of centralized services that enables them to efficiently and cost effectively produce both printed and electronic documents. GPO has offered these publications for sale to the public and made them widely available for no fee public access through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). The FDLP has also served the purpose of providing permanent public access to government publications. Microcomp is currently used to compose the majority of Congressional documents and select Federal agency publications that are printed and disseminated electronically by GPO. Microcomp was originally designed to compose data files with typesetting-specific codes called Locators. Locator codes are tied to external format files that specify style attributes to be applied to segments of content.
CSR will count among its user classes over 200 content creators working in all branches of the government and over 100 Government composition operators.

Opportunity

GPO is seeking to identify a vendor(s) that can provide integration services or Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and custom solution sets to support the development of CSR. The ultimate objective for the program will be to integrate and deliver a fully functional system to meet the requirements as defined in the CSR documentation.

Contractor responsibilities may include:
&#61607;	Development of integration software to implement CSR in conformance with GPO system development methodologies;
&#61607;	Development of custom solutions for functionality that cannot be met through COTS tools.
&#61607;	Assisting in the selection of COTS technology components for CSR.
&#61607;	Acquisition of additional IT and network products with sufficient capacity to meet the CSR’s load performance, security, legacy conversion/migration, configuration management and reliability specifications;
&#61607;	Assisting GPO in testing the system;
&#61607;	Training the user community;
&#61607;	Providing short and/or long-term support for the system once operational. 
&#61607;	Providing necessary plans and participate in GPO reviews

Informational Meeting (Industry Day)

On 6 May 2008 from 8:30 AM until 12:30 PM (prior to the release of any formal request for proposal), GPO will be conducting an informational meeting (Industry Day) at its headquarters in Washington, DC. The meeting is open to any interested vendor who has products or services that are in direct support of the requirements identified for the CSR. Space for the event is limited to 80 people and pre-registration is required. Vendors are allowed no more than two (2) representatives total for an entire company and GPO reserves the right to reduce that number to one (1) in order to mitigate overcrowding. Individual divisions or groups of a single company are considered a single parent company. It is strongly recommended that at least one (1) of the participants be from one of the vendor’s technical division(s).

All wishing to participate in Industry Day must pre-register by providing the names of attendees and indication of interest via email to pmo@gpo.gov (subject heading “CSR Industry Day Pre-registration”) no later than 12:00 (noon) eastern time on 29 April 2008. The session will be open to only those vendors who have pre-registered. NOTE: Accessibility for persons with a disability is provided, but must be noted in the pre-registration email. Please include the type of accommodation required in the email. 

Vendors are also encouraged to submit questions about CSR to GPO prior to Industry Day. These questions will be addressed by GPO personnel at Industry Day. All questions must be submitted in writing via email to pmo@gpo.gov (subject heading “CSR Industry Day Questions”) no later than 12:00 (noon) eastern time on 29 April 2008.

Background Material

Additional background material is available through the Program Management Office website (http://www.gpo.gov/compsys.htm). It is strongly encouraged that all attendees be familiar with the following documents:

&#61607;	CSR Concept of Operations V 1.1 (PDF) – The document which provides a high-level conceptual vision of CSR.

&#61607;	CSR Requirements Document V 1.0 (PDF) – The document which identifies the requirements for the CSR.

&#61607;	CSR Preliminary Requirements Document Supplement (PDF) – The document which illustrates specific requirements through graphic examples.


Requested Information:

Vendors should furnish the following information to GPO: 

1.	Capability statement
2.	Requirements matrix
3.	White Paper: Comments on CSR Documentation (RD, ConOps, etc.)

Capability Statement:
Keeping GPO’s goals in mind please outline how your organization would perform the services of an integrator or how your organization’s products and/or technology map to a solution set.

Vendors are hereby requested to submit a capability statement (10 pages or less and no marketing material) that addresses their ability to deliver the required products and/or services to develop and implement CSR. Vendors who are interested in specific solution sets must submit a capability statement that addresses specific solution sets. Vendors may submit separate statements for both integrator and solution sets. Please also list company points of contact and GSA Schedule number (if applicable). 

Requirements Matrix:
GPO has created a requirements matrix that will allow the opportunity for vendors to show how their solution sets meet specific CSR requirements. This Excel spreadsheet has been included as a separate attachment to this RFI. Vendors should complete this spreadsheet as completely as possible.

White Paper: Comments on CSR Documentation: (RD, ConOps, etc.)
Vendors should submit a separate document (20 pages or less) that summarizes the vendor’s comments on the various documentation provided by GPO on CSR. Vendors should identify any gaps in the documentation and approach, including areas requiring further technology development or solutions, missing or ambiguous requirements, and any other general comments or concerns. Feedback in the white paper should also include specific comments and suggestions for refining the documents to reflect clear guidance to industry and industry best practices.


Capability statements, Requirements Matrices, and Comments on CSR Documentation must be submitted in a singular email by noon on 23 May 2008, to pmo@gpo.gov (subject heading “CSR Industry Day RFI Response: YOUR COMPANY NAME”). Faxed copies are not acceptable.

10 Dec 07: The purpose of this post is to provide Industry the current status on the JTC TRS Program.  See attached file labeled JTC TRS status 10 Dec 2007.pdf.
*******************************************PROGRAM SCOPE: The Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project under the Tactical Airborne Control System funds developments necessary to provide Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable high-fidelity Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), and Combat Control Team (CCT) training and rehearsal system. The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW ATTACHMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<DESC><p>CMS is conducting market research to identify both large and small firms that are capable of performing the Emergency Prescription Assistance Program (EPAP) as described in the attachment to this posting. CMS is not interested in obtaining the services of an integrator, but is looking for a firm that can meet all the requirements as described in the document attached to this posting. Respondents may submit capability statements of no more than 10 pages (10 pitch, new times roman font) addressing their ability to meet the government's needs under this program. In addition to the 10 page document, interested parties should provide a description of contracts/work they have performed of a similar scope and size to that described in the EPAP attached document.

<p>Capability information must be submitted to the following e-mail address no later than April 28, 2008 to:</p>
<p>Carol.sevel@cms.hhs.gov<br />Christopher.worrall@cms.hhs.gov</p>

This posting is purely for the purposes of conducting market research. This document does not constitute an obligation of Government funds.</p>
<p>Emergency Prescription Assistance Program (EPAP)</p>
<p>In the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, community retail pharmacies were ready, willing and able to assist victims and evacuees. In many disaster areas, community pharmacists were on the scene before any other medical professionals providing first aid and prescription drug assistance to victims. Through the coordinating efforts of DHHS/CMS, community pharmacists were able to set up and serve the emergency needs of evacuees from Katrina at hundreds of evacuee sites using the existing private drug distribution system.</p>
<p>Conflicting directions from Federal, State, local and private agencies, along with the lack of any established process for enlisting the help from this community resource were among the biggest challenges for these pharmacies. Pharmacies that dispensed medications and some Durable Medical Equipment (DME) to Katrina evacuees found it challenging to settle claims due to a lack of clarity with how to navigate different layers of government to find the appropriate payer of last resort.<br /><br />Prescription drugs and DME are critical first line therapies in treating both acute and chronic conditions. For this reason, assuring an adequate and readily available supply is a priority for emergency planning.</p>
<p>As a byproduct of our experience with hurricane Katrina, the federal government established the Emergency Prescription Assistance Program (EPAP) to fully leverage private sector resources for efficient prescription drug distribution. CMS is now conducting market research to determine the availability of vendors such as, but not limited to, prescription drug and DME claims processors who may be capable of administering this critical emergency response program. Requirements for the EPAP claims processor include:</p>
<p>&bull; Providing access at any pharmacy in the nation, via either in-network or out of network pharmacy claims, up to a 30-day supply of necessary prescription drugs and limited DME for individuals who were affected by a disaster of national significance and have no other health insurance. <br /><br />&bull; Activating the EPAP upon notification from the CMS Project Officer, and will provide timely reports of EPAP claims to CMS.</p>
<p>&bull; Distributing appropriate payer sheets and eligibility information to all network pharmacies, including posting of this information on its website, and examine the feasibility of performing back-end eligibility checks to safeguard the integrity of the EPAP as a payer of last resort.</p>
<p>&bull; Making its call center available to participating pharmacies and eligible individuals through a toll-free number.</p>
<p>&bull; Communicating with government, charitable organizations and private industry to ensure eligible pharmacy claims can be identified and processed in necessary brick and mortar, mobile and out of area pharmacies.</p>
<p>&bull; Examining the feasibility of facilitating a pharmaceutical product donation for drugs dispensed under this program, potentially reducing federal government costs to respond to a disaster.</p>
<p>The EPAP claims processor will be reimbursed under a cost reimbursement contract for operational expenses incurred outside of the normal course of business, including paid claims (at existing network rates), EPAP communications, back-end eligibility checks, additional call center staffing and scripts, reports for manufacturer product donations and other operational expenses directly related to the management of the EPAP. The EPAP claims processor will utilize a different reimbursement metric for claims associated with manufacture product donations.</p>
<p>CMS cannot reimburse the contractor for any activities prior to activation during a disaster of national significance. While it is impossible to predict on an annual basis how often the EPAP will be activated, we expect EPAP activation to occur very infrequently. It is important to note that, while Presidential Declarations (emergency or major disaster) may average around 50 per year, not every Presidential Declaration would invoke the EPAP. Since 2003, only the following events, with varying levels of exposure, would have potentially activated the EPAP:</p>
<p>2006 - Tropical Storm Ernesto <br />2005 - Hurricanes Katrina and Rita<br />2004 - 4 major Hurricanes (in close proximity, by geography and date) <br />2003 - Hurricane Isabel</p>

<DESC>NASA/KSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for an lightning instrumentation system.  NASA will integrate this system at the John F. Kennedy Space Center. 
 The system must meet all of the following technical requirements.  Please explain/describe your system's capability to meet all of these requirements.   
 1. GENERAL  a. Scalable multi-channel data acquisition system capable of "window" triggering from any of its inputs and capable of accommodating from 40 to 120 channels.  b. IRIG-B time synchronization capability with multi mainframes timing synchronization to better than 250 nsecs.  c. Automatic trigger/record/re-arm sequence.  d. Capability to record in segmented memory mode.  e. Remote status/setup/configuration capabilities including capability to download waveforms remotely through Ethernet, check status, and reconfigure the system.  
 2. TRIGGERING  a. Segmented memory should allow for 10ms-20ms time segments with zero dead time between subsequent segments without the use of parallel channels/acquisitions.  b. System capable of recording up to 40 segments within two(2) seconds. No dead time between acquisitions. c. Any input channel may trigger the acquisition (in case of multiple transient recorders, only the transient recorder(s) where transients are occurring is(are) required to trigger).  d. "OR" window triggering. Each chassis/scope has to trigger any time any of the signals being monitored leaves a predefined window. Windows are defined by high and low threshold levels. Windows for different channels on the same chassis/scope may be different.  e. Capability to skew the channels to compensate for different cable lengths.  f.  Pre-trigger capability of 20 to 50% of the segment.  
 3. ISOLATION  a. Fiber optic links are required to bring signals from the field to the transient recorders inside instrumentation room(s). Fiber optic links will be required to transmit signals through different fiber lengths, with the maximum cable run of about 4000 meters through at least one fiber optic bulkhead connector.  b. Close-loop verification capabilities to allow end-to-end channel tests, fiber, and power status through the network.  c. Most fiber optic transmitters will be installed outdoors next to the sensors and subject to environmental requirements: estimated operating temperature from 0 to 70°C and harsh launch vibration environment.  d. Fiber optic receivers along with the transient recorders will reside in instrumentation rooms where vibration requirements may be less stringent and the temperature will be controlled.  
 4. SAMPLING  a. The required analog bandwidth of the system is 25MHz.  b. Sampling rates shall be at least four times the analog bandwidth. 
 5. DATA STORAGE  a. Transient recorders should be capable to locally store at least 80 segments per channel.  
 6. MISCELLANEOUS  a. System's ability to generate automated reports in .pdf format. 
 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. 
 Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed all of the stated requirements are invited to submit documentation that includes the dimensions and weight of the proposed equipment, literature, datasheets, brochures, and references.  
 Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product. A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. 
 This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  
 The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. All responses shall be submitted to Regina Clifton no later than April 10, 2008.

<RESPDATE>050708
<CONTACT>Billie  Kindschuh, Phone (405)734-8094, Email billie.kindschuh@tinker.af.mil
<DESC><p>The purpose of the modification is to: Change Clins: 0001AD, 0001AE ;
<p>FIRST: BAE Systems has agreed to renegotiate the quantities and prices on the referenced CLINS for Option Years III and IV only. This is a one time renegotiation to increase the BEQ and estimated contract price. the renegotiation is necessary because the contract dollar value and the BEQ have been exceeded and to maintain supportability of OC-ALC while a new requirement is developed.</p>
<p>SECOND: This renegotiation is in the best interest of both parties since the repair of the F108 Power Management control (PMC) is sole source to BAE Systems.</p>
<p>THIRD: Based on the BAE Systems response to the renegotiation request dated 06 Feb 08 the following changes are hereby made to this contract:</p>
<p>FROM: TO:</p>
<p>ORIGINAL RENEGOTIATED INCREASE<br />CLIN BEQ BEQ <br />0001AD 24 EA 62 EA 38 EA<br />0001AE 24 EA 88 EA 64 EA</p>
<p>FOURTH: The change in the estimated total contract value for Option Year III and Option Year IV is as follows:<br />ORIGINAL RENEGOTIATED INCREASED <br />ESTIMATED ESTIMATED ESTIMATED<br />CLIN QTY TOTAL PRICE TOTAL PRICE TOTAL PRICE <br />Option Year III 0001AD 17 EA $32,400.00 $83,700.00 + $51,300.00<br />Option Year IV 0001AE 88 EA $33,696.00 $123,552.00 + $89,856.00<br />TOTAL ESTIMATED INCREASE $141,156.00</p>
<p>FIFTH: The additional estimated price for Line Item 0002 in Option Year III is $737,428.00. For Option Year IV the estimated additional price is $1,046,672.00. This brings the estimated total increase for Line Item 0002 for both option years to $1,784,100.00. The additional estimate for Line Item 0002 will be expended as each asset has the required repairs performed. The type and number of repairs cannot be determined by the Government or by the contractor prior to the induction of the asset. Therefore no quantity or price is being set forth for specific Line Item 0002 types of repair.</p>
<p>INCREASED ESTIMATED<br />CLIN TOTAL PRICE <br />Option Year III 0002 + $ 737,428.00<br />Option Year IV 0002 + $1,046,672.00<br />TOTAL ESTIMATED INCREASE $1,784,100.00</p>
<p>SIXTH: The estimated total increase for Line Items 0001 and 0002 for the remainder of the current Option Year III and Option Year IV is:<br /><br />CLIN ESTIMATED INCREASE<br />Option Year III 0001AD + $51,300.00<br />0002 + $737,428.00 Option Year III Total $788,728.00<br />Option Year IV 0001AE + $89,856.00<br />0002 + $1,046,672.00 Option Year IV Total $1,136,260.00<br />TOTAL ESTIMATED INCREASE $1,925,256.00<br />SEVENTH: Based on SEVENTH and EIGHTH above it is anticipated the total estimated contract price will be increased by $1,925,256.00. The original total estimated contract price was $1,506,498.00, however the actual dollars expended on this contract are $1,957,855.00, therefore this amount is used to determine the new estimated total contract price after renegotiation.</p>
<p>FROM: $1,506,498.00 Original Estimated Contract Price</p>
<p>ACTUAL PRICE: $1,957,85.00 Actual Contract Price (Dollars Spent To Date)<br />BY: $1,925,256.00 Estimated Increase for Opt Years III and IV</p>
<p>TO: $3,883,111.00 Estimated Total contract Price After Renegotiation</p>
<p>EIGHTH: The delivery schedule set forth in the original contract remains unchanged.</p>
<p>NINTH: BAE Systems accepts the change to CLIN 0003 from G009 Reporting to CAV AF Reporting. For CLIN 0003 the CAV AF will be effective from 01June 2008 for Option Year IV. The Contractor Data Listing Requirement set forth on the DD 1423-1 E002 dated 16 Jan 2008 and the Data Item Description are attached to this modification.</p>
<p>TENTH: BAE Systems agrees to perform CAV AF Data Reporting in accordance with the attached Appendix B for CAV AF Contracts. The Appendix B dated October 2003 is hereby replaced in its entirety with the attached Appendix B for CAV AF Contracts dated 5 Sep 2007.</p>
<p>ELEVENTH: All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>

<DESC><p>In furtherance of the FPI Board of Directors' directive to pursue the creation of inmate jobs without reliance on mandatory source, a notice was published in the December 21, 1998 edition of the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) regarding FPI's production of products for the Federal government on a competitive (non-mandatory) basis. The notice stated that the Board of Directors had granted approval for FPI to competitively bid on products for which it did not rely on its mandatory source of supply. Under this procedure, FPI would not follow the public involvement guidelines process established by 18 U.S.C. 4122(b) which is required for new products FPI offers as a mandatory source. FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product purchased by the Federal government.</p>
<p>This notice announces FPI's intentions to produce lamps on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status. These products encompass all lamps in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 6240 - Electric Lamps, and FSC 7290 - Miscellaneous Household and Commercial Furnishings and Appliances.</p>
<p>Once a product is sold competitively<a name="BM_1_"></a> by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI's Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product. FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time nor seek from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date. It has been previously determined by the FPI Board of Directors that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a competitive basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2). Sales of products manufactured under this procedure will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI as is the case for subcontracting and services.</p>
<p>Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions with FPI's Board of Directors. All written correspondence should be addressed to: Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534. All comments received will be provided to the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational arms of NOAA. Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD and Aircraft Operations Center in Tampa, FL, OMAO operates, maintains and manages the ships and aircraft used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations critical to meeting NOAA's extensive mission.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>OMAO has operated aircraft in support of the NOAA National Weather Service, National Hurricane Center and the Hurricane Research Division for several decades. These mission flights are generally in support of the Hurricane Surveillance Mission and the Hurricane High Density Core Mission. Since 1996, NOAA has operated one G-IVSP aircraft to provide this support. These missions provide life and property-saving products including tropical cyclone outlooks, forecasts, watches, warnings, and storm surge products for the U.S., twenty-four countries in the Americas and Caribbean, and the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern North Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>NOAA seeks information on similar industry charter aircraft capabilities in support of the NOAA Aircraft Recapitalization Plan.</p>
<p>The overall program objectives are to improve hurricane track and intensity forecasts, increase the average lead-time for hurricane landfalls and improve hurricane wind speed forecasts through the collection of meteorological data within the hurricane environment. To achieve these objectives, observations must be taken within and around the hurricane environment including the Central Dense Overcast during specific synoptic periods (reconnaissance). By obtaining high-density observations of the 3-dimensional structure of developing and mature tropical cyclones (high density core), NOAA can produce forecast products using the Hurricane Weather and Research Forecasting (HWRF) modeling tool.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The aircraft flight profiles required to capture necessary airborne data requirements of these missions require flying into most regions of tropical cyclones up to Category 5 Hurricanes at altitudes from 35000' MSL up to and including the service ceiling of the aircraft. These flights include rainband penetration and flight within heavy convective activity. Long range and long endurance capabilities are required to meet the trackline requirements in and around the storm environment within the specified 6-hour synoptic period before returning to staging base.</p>
<p>Subject aircraft must have the payload capacity and electrical-capacity (stated under Aircraft Requirements) to support four networked scientific data stations per flight and four associated mission personnel to operate these stations.</p>
<p>To complete NOAA hurricane research and surveillance requirements, the following aircraft performance and instrumentation, observational and availability specifications are required for each proposed aircraft:<br />Aircraft Minimum Requirements:</p>
<p>2 Engine turbojet aircraft <br />4000 nm range <br />10.3 - hour endurance<br />45,000 foot MSL or greater service ceiling<br />2,500 pound payload capacity<br />Operational speed range: 490 - 567 KTAS<br />VHF, HF and SATCOM communication capability<br />C-band 180-degree swath forward-looking nose weather avoidance radar</p>
<p>Vertical Scanning Doppler radar:</p>
<p>Reflectivity:<br />Accuracy: + or - 2 dBZ or less<br />Resolution: 0.5 dBZ or less<br />Maximum Unambiguous Range: 50 km or more<br />Spatial Sampling, range coverage 0 - 50 km:<br />- 1.5 km or less horizontal &amp; vertical sampling at 30 km range<br />- 0.1 km or less beam width and pulse depth at 2 km range (to allow for high resolution measurements)<br />Minimum detectable signal: - 12 dBZ or less at 10 km <br />Maximum detectable signal: 70 dBZ or more</p>
<p>3- Dimensional Wind Field: <br />Vector Velocity Accuracy: + or - 1 m/s or less (including the effects of independent samples, aircraft velocity and pointing knowledge)<br />Resolution: 0.1 m/s or less<br />Maximum Unambiguous Velocity: + or - 50 m/s or less<br />Maximum Unambiguous Range: 50 km or more<br />Spatial Sampling, range coverage 0 - 50 km:<br />- 1.5 km or less horizontal &amp; vertical sampling at 30 km range<br />0.1 km or less beam width and pulse depth at 2 km range (to allow for high resolution measurements)</p>
<p>Scientific electrical power requirements: 36 KVA <br />Scientific data station requirements (each): Scientific Data recording for 40 digital channels accommodating standard avionic and scientific protocols and 90 analog channels. Scientific data processing and display of all data collected at 4 stations including avionic data, calculated meteorological parameters, data from nose radar, vertical and horizontal scanning radar, scientific data input and output via Satellite Communication.</p>
<p>Environmental Observations / Measurements Required (each flight):</p>
<p>- In-situ state variables (pressure, temperature, humidity, east-west wind component, north-south wind component, vertical wind component, location, altitude) at data rates up to 40 Hz and available to other data systems via intraplane telecommunications.<br />- Ability to launch government-furnished expendables (GPS dropsondes, airborne expendable ocean probes, e.g., bathythermographs, current probes, and conductivity, temperature and depth probes-AXBT, AXCP, AXCTD, respectively) while retaining aircraft pressurization (to sample the atmosphere to the ocean surface, and to 200m below the ocean surface). Launch capability to deploy GPS dropwindsondes at rates up to one per minute with 8-channel tracking capability. Expendable dropsonde specifications are available upon request.<br />- Capability to carry and operate a number of government-furnished remote sensors (passive and active) at the same time in a suite (e.g., radiometers, scatterometers, Lidars, interferometers).<br />- Moderately high bandwidth communications with the ground (500k baud).<br />- Digital satellite data and voice communications</p>
<p>Availability (annually):</p>
<p>One aircraft with the above requirements is required to be available and must be able to support simultaneous tropical-cyclone related flights for the entire hurricane season (annually from June 1 - November 30), within 15 hours of notification from NOAA. Up to 600 flight hours may be required on the proposed aircraft during this 6-month period. Indicate the period of mission unavailability (in days, including transit time) to complete any required scheduled maintenance for each aircraft to fly 600 hours during the 6 months hurricane season, and the time (in flight hours or calendar days) when this requirement would have to be met (i.e., one 10-day maintenance period after 200 flight hours).</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED IN RESPONSES</p>
<p>Please include with your response:</p>
<p>Descriptive Literature <br />Performance Specifications<br />Technical Specifications<br />Limited pricing information including GSA schedule pricing and contract number<br />Statement of aircraft availability<br />Price per hour per aircraft<br />Daily charge per aircraft<br />Crew charges (each aircraft) per flight hour and per day, if not included in above<br />Any other charges that would be incurred by the Government for the use of proposed aircraft for stated availability period<br />Scientific modification costs*<br />Description of ability to meet the requirements of this RFI<br />Business Size</p>
<p>*If proposed aircraft are incapable of obtaining any of the environmental observations required above, provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) to equip each aircraft with the capabilities necessary to meet the observational requirements including engineering, hardware, software, modification, FAA-type Certification, labor and parts costs and timeline to complete these modifications.

<DESC>A request has been put into Western Regional Contracting Office on 2 April 2008 by the Information Management Division for a move of FDA approved Data Acquisition System (DAS) boxes that transmit baby vitals from the bedside unit to CIS/Essentris allowing staff to monitor baby vitals real-time.  At the same time, this move will involve an upgrade of current DAS boxes to a more reliable model which translates to better patient care.  The Vendor will have to not only move these boxes but configure them to support the L&D and renovation projects.  CliniComp is the owner and manufacturer for CIS/Essentric, and the hardware and labor for this request is specifically for CIS/Essentric.  No other vendor is authorized to perform this task by making changes to the system.  CliniComp has proprietary rights to the software used in the government-owned equipment at Madigan Army Medical Center.  It is recommended that award be made to CliniComp as a sole source award based on the criteria identified above.See Note 22.

NCSA has demonstrated its uniqueability to visualize the enormous scale, structure and evolution of theUniverse.  NCSA has mapped regions of the Universe & black holes in waysthat have never been seen before.  NCSA's visualizations are unsurpassedby any other visualization team. NCSA models & manipulates 3D space tocreate distinct & accurate views of the Universe.   
 *	NCSA develops and deploys powerful, reliable computing, data,and networking resources that enable researchers to solve the mostdemanding science and engineering problems in a timely manner.  
 *	NCSA provides insights into astronomical complex systems toshare the thrill of scientific discovery with the broadest possibleaudience through artful visualizations of scientific phenomena. 
 *	NCSA operates some of the world's most powerful supercomputersand develops the software needed to efficiently use these systems. 
 *	NCSA collaborates with top scientists in astrophysics communityto develop accurate computations models & simulations with data. 
 NCSA has produced visualizations for numerous science documentaries &museum shows such as: 
 *	NOVA's "Monster of the Milky Way *	Black hole science for a planetarium dome show, "Black Holes:The Other Side of Infinity                 *	Academy Award-nominated IMAX film "Cosmic Voyage," *	NOVA's acclaimed HDTV cosmology program "Runaway Universe," *	HDTV NOVA special "Hunt for the Supertwister." *	"The Search for Life: Are We Alone?" for the American Museum ofNatural History's Hayden Planetarium 
 STATEMENT OF WORK FOR JWST SCIENTIFIC VISUALIZATIONS

This announcement constitutes theonly solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitationwill not be issued. 
 This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Request for Quotation(RFQ) to Zodiac Data Systems, Inc., Heim Data Division, Alpharetta, GA.for: 
 GSS Ground Station Recording System (3 Each).  Each unit consists ofGSS100 mainframe, GSS Media 2.3, Link modules, Channel Analog Record andReplay modules, 8 Channel PCM, and ICP modules 
 Last item. 
 This single source purchase is justified due to the advantages ofmaintaining a homogeneous fleet of GSRS's.  These advantages are asfollows: 
 The use of the same Ground Station Recording Systems will allow theGovernment to maintain spare parts for only one Ground Station RecordingSystem.  Spares are maintained at both CCAFS and VAFB operationallocations a homogenous fleet will significantly reduce the cost ofmaintaining spare parts for our GSRS. 
 These GSRS's will be installed, maintained and operated by thecontractor that supports LSP operations at VAFB and CCAFS.  Thecontractor has substantial investments in training on Zodiac DataSystems Ground Station Recorder Systems.  The procurement of a GSRS fromanother manufacturer would result in significant cost increases in orderto provide additional training for the contractor personnel. 
 The acquisition of any other contractor's recertification off the basewould entail unacceptable technical risk and unacceptable procurementlead time and cost. The Government would be impacted by significantincrease to cost and schedule.  Additional time would also be requiredfor testing a design to meet system requirements. 
 This purchase is part of NASA's Launch Service Program (LSP) TelemetryLab upgrades at Kennedy Space Center and its field sites.  This upgradeis intended to complete a homogenous fleet of Ground Station RecordingSystems (GSRS) for our Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) andVandenberg (VAFB) operations.  This purchase will complete the fleet ofZodiac Data Systems GSRS's.

<DESC><p>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Research Systems, Inc. (dba: ITT Visual Information Solutions). This combined synopsis/solicitation is posted with the intent of awarding to Research Systems, Inc. (dba: ITT Visual Information Solutions), 4990 Pearl East Circle, Boulder, CO 80301-2530. These items are the sole proprietary product of the vendor and no other authorized resellers are anticipated. The requirement is for the following ENVI items:
<p>CLIN0001: P/N - 27BUNWINFLLIC SARScape Basic &amp; inSAR Bundle Windows Floating License and Maintenance (Qty = 2), <br />CLIN0002: P/N - 27PIWINFLLIC SARScape Polarimetry &amp; PollnSAR Windows Floating License and Maintenance (Qty = 2), <br />CLIN0003: P/N - 27FIWINFLLIC SARScape Filter Windows Floating License and Maintenance (Qty = 2), <br />CLIN0004: P/N - 27FOWNFLLIC SARScape Focusing Windows Floating License and Maintenance (Qty = 2), <br />CLIN0005: P/N - 27SIWINFLLIC SARScape ScanSAR Interferometry Windows Floating License and Maintenance (Qty = 2), <br />CLIN0006: P/N - 27BWINFLLIC SARScape Persistent Scatterers Module and Maintenance (Qty = 2).</p>
<p>Period of performance should cover timeframe from Award to 06/30/2008.</p>
<p><br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: ENVI is a proprietary software application made by ITT Visual Information Solutions. Selection of a different product would not be compatible with our customers needs as this software is used to support Research and Development of exploitation and analysis algorithms and tools that will immediately be compliant and interface with the NGA legacy Systems. New tools and algorithms are tested in a simulated operational environment to determine if and how they will function when placed in research and development using these applications. Due to the fact that this software is already integrated into the NGA enterprise it would be extremely costly for the Agency to switch to a new type of software. A switch at this juncture would cause personnel to have to be trained to use new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to the implementation of any new software.</p>
<p>Delivery is FOB Destination to NGA Reston, Attn: William J. Harrison/IJ, 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive, MS: P-129, Reston, VA 20191-3349 in the quantities listed above.</p>
<p>Quotes should contain Open Market Commercial pricing with any applicable discounts applied. All boxes must be sealed and unopened. Total cost shall include all shipping and handling. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, with no obligation to the offeror by the Government.</p>

Hold rigidly in place inserts, plates, weldments, lifting devices and other items to be imbedded in precast concrete products so that they do not move significantly during casting operations.<BR><BR>6..2   CONCRETE<BR><BR>6.2.1   Concrete Mixing<BR><BR>Mixing operations shall produce batch-to-batch uniformity of strength, consistency, and appearance.<BR><BR>6.2.2   Concrete Placing<BR><BR>Deposit concrete into forms as near to its final location as practical.  Keep the free fall of the concrete to a minimum.  Consolidate concrete in such a manner that segregation of the concrete is minimized and honeycombed areas are kept to a minimum.  Use vibrators to consolidate concrete with frequencies and amplitudes sufficient to produce well consolidated concrete.<BR><BR>6.2.2.1   Cold Weather Concreting<BR><BR>Perform cold weather concreting in accordance with ACI 306.1.<BR><BR>a.  Provide adequate equipment for heating concrete materials and protecting concrete during freezing or near-freezing weather.<BR><BR>b.  Free from frost all concrete materials and all reinforcement, forms, fillers, and ground with which concrete is to come in contact.<BR><BR>c.  Do not use frozen materials or materials containing ice.<BR><BR>d.  In cold weather the temperature of concrete at the time of placing shall not be below 45 degrees F.  Discard concrete that freezes before its compressive strength reaches 500 psi.<BR><BR>6.2.2.2   Hot Weather Concreting<BR><BR>Recommendations for hot weather concreting are given in detail in ACI 305R.  During hot weather, give proper attention to constituents, production methods, handling, placing, protection, and curing to prevent excessive concrete temperatures or water evaporation that could impair required strength or serviceability of the member or structure.  The temperature of concrete at the time of placing shall not exceed 90 degrees F.<BR><BR>6.2.3   Concrete Curing<BR><BR>Commence curing immediately following the initial set and completion of surface finishing.<BR><BR>6.2.3.1   Curing by Moisture Retention<BR><BR>Prevent moisture evaporation from exposed surfaces until adequate strength for stripping is reached by one of the following methods:<BR><BR>a.  Cover with polyethylene sheets a minimum of 6 mils thick per ASTM C 171.<BR><BR>b.  Cover with burlap or other absorptive material and keep continually moist.<BR><BR>c.  Use of a membrane-curing compound applied at a rate not to exceed 200 square ft/gallon, or per manufacturers' recommendations according to ASTM C 309.<BR><BR>6.2.3.2   Curing with Heat and Moisture<BR><BR>Do not subject concrete to steam or hot air until after the concrete has attained its initial set.  Apply steam, if used, within a suitable enclosure, which permits free circulation of the steam in accordance with CAN/CSA A23.4.  If hot air is used for curing, take precautions to prevent moisture loss from the concrete.  The temperature of the concrete shall not be permitted to exceed 150 degrees F.  These requirements do not apply to products cured with steam under pressure in an autoclave.<BR><BR>6.2.4   Surface Finish<BR><BR>Finish unformed surfaces of wet-cast precast concrete products as specified.  If no finishing procedure is specified, finish such surfaces using a strike-off to level the concrete with the top of the form.<BR><BR>6.2.4.1   Formed Non-Architectural Surfaces<BR><BR>Cast surfaces against approved forms following industry practices in cleaning forms, designing concrete mixes, placing and curing concrete.  Normal color variations, form joint marks, small surface holes caused by air bubbles, and minor chips and spalls will be accepted but no major imperfections, honeycombs or other major defects will be permitted.<BR><BR>6.2.5   Stripping Products from Forms<BR><BR>Do not remove products from the forms until the concrete reaches the compressive strength for stripping required by the design.  If no such requirement exists, products may be removed from the forms after the final set of concrete providedthat stripping damage is minimal.<BR><BR>6.2.6   Patching and Repair<BR><BR>No repair is required to formed surfaces that are relatively free of air voids and honeycombed areas, unless the surfaces are required by the design to be finished.<BR><BR>6.2.6.1   Repairing Minor Defects<BR><BR>Defects that will not impair the functional use or expected life of a precast concrete product may be repaired by any method that does not impair the product.<BR><BR>6.2.6.2   Repairing Honeycombed Areas<BR><BR>When honeycombed areas are to be repaired, remove all loose material and cut back the areas into essentially horizontal or vertical planes to a depth at which coarse aggregate particles break under chipping rather than being dislodged.  Use proprietary repair materials in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.  If a proprietary repair material is not used, saturate the area with water.  Immediately prior to repair, the area should be damp, but free of excess water.  Apply a cement-sand grout or an approved bonding agent to the chipped surfaces, followed immediately by consolidating an appropriate repair material into the cavity.<BR><BR>6.2.6.3   Repairing Major Defects<BR><BR>Evaluate, by qualified personnel, defects in precast concrete products which impair the functional use or the expected life of products to determine if repairs are feasible and, if so, to establish the repair procedure.<BR><BR>6.2.7   Shipping Products<BR><BR>Do not ship products until they are at least 5 days old, unless it can be shown that the concrete strength has reached at least 75% of the specified 28-day strength, or that damage will not result, impairing the performance of the product.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>1.  Amendment 01 is hereby incorporated into Request for Proposal (RFP) number SP3100-08-R-0017 and shall become a part of any resultant contract.
2.  The following are responses to contractor submitted questions:

Question 1:  Clin 0001 Yale esc040fa you show dimensions of 38L X 13W X 31H Yale shows 38L X 20.8W X 30.5H -- so width appears wrong Also you can put in an 18 125 17 w/ 1000 amp hours or 18 125 13 w/ 750 amp hours in the Yale erc040fa - which do you want? both meet the 620 AH minimum but the price is different.
Answer 1:  The 38L X 20.8W X 30.5H is correct. I am not sure where the other value came from.  The requirement is 620 AH minimum.

Question 2:  Clin 0002 12-85- 15  has 595 amp hours--you ask for 750 amp hours rating--amp hours is wrong or battery is wrong.  Also, on part number - Desert Hog is a brand---12-85-15 is type or part number. We provide a Douglas legacy 12-85-15.
Answer 2:  Yale stock selector is correct. 750 AH was a mistake, it should be 550 AH minimum rating.

Question 3:  Clin 0003  Yale erc040ag--36 X 26 X 22 H  980 amp hours To fit (and Yale shows) 18 85 17 battery w/ 680 amp hours rating The 980 Amp hours must be wrong.
Answer 3:  The battery is a 18-85-19.

3.  The closing date for submission of offers will remain as MARCH 5, 2008, 3:30 PM EST.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<DESC><p>* START OF NOTICE MODIFICATION 1 *</p>
<p>This notice modification is solely to correct the anticipated deadline for the government receipt of bids.</p>
<p>The anticipated deadline for the government receipt of bids is 02 JUN 2008.</p>
<p>The official deadline will be listed within Block 13 on Page 1 of the solicitation document.</p>
<p>* END OF NOTICE MODIFICATION 1 *</p>
<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) has conducted large-scale explosion experiments to evaluate the strength characteristics and air-leakage resistance of various mine ventilation control structures including seals. Ventilation seals are used for safely isolating worked-out areas in underground coal mines. The seal design evaluations are conducted within the multiple entry section of the PRL Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM) or within two test chambers located within the LLEM. The large-scale underground chambers are used to conduct static loading tests either through the use of pressurized water (hydrostatic or hydraulic testing) or the confined ignition of flammable concentrations of methane. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a requirement to deepen and widen the existing chamber to allow for the hydrostatic pressure loading evaluation of new seal designs. As such, the work will consist of removing the existing chamber floor, deepening the chamber by about 20 ft, widening the chamber by about 5 ft, installing new plumbing into the chamber, installing a floor drain and drainage line, extending the existing fiber optic network to the hydrostatic chamber area, installation of two remote controlled cameras with associated video equipment, and installation of Voice Over IP phones. The magnitude of the requirement, in terms of an estimated price range, is between $250,000 and $500,000. This requirement is solicited on a full and open competition - unrestricted basis. The CDC intends to award a single Construction / Firm-Fixed-Price contract. The requirement is to be completed within 150 calendar days after the Government issues a Notice To Proceed. The complete solicitation document and reference material will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 10 APR 2008. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted. It is the responsibility of prospective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps Internet site. An organized site visit is scheduled for 24 APR 2008 at 10:00 am local time. Offerors are urged and expected to inspect the site where the work will be performed at this time. Participants will meet at Lake Lynn Laboratory, 2546 Springhill Furnace Road (Route 857), Lake Lynn, PA 15451. Upon entering the facility, next to the Lake Lynn Laboratory sign, visitors should be safety conscious of heavy equipment traffic on lanes shared with an adjacent active mine. Follow NIOSH signs to a security gate and contact Government personnel to proceed by use of the intercom. Follow visitor signs to the main office building for sign-in. The following Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is required to be worn while inside of the mine: steel toe safety shoes, hard hat, mine belt, safety glasses, W65 self-rescuer or equivalent, cap lamp or flashlight. It is recommended that attendees provide their own PPE due to limited quantities available for use during the site visit from the Government. Appropriate clothing is also recommended for temperature conditions between 55-60 degrees (can be much colder dependent on outside temperatures near the entry and portal area). Attendee-provided spotlights may enhance viewing of the work site. Non-U.S. Citizens must be cleared in advance of attendance. Such individuals should email the point of contact identified within this announcement by no later than 12:00 PM EST on 14 APR 2008 to provide the Government sufficient time to process the security clearance. Only email requests will be honored. Email requests should include the following for each Non-U.S. Citizen attendee: visitor full official name, gender, date of birth, place of birth (city, providence, state, country), country of citizenship, passport type and number, date of passport expiration, permanent resident number if the visitor is a permanent U.S. resident, type of visa with issue and expiration dates if the visitor is currently in the U.S., organization, position and title within the organization, organization address, organization telephone number, email address, residency address. No government-wide notes apply.</p>

<DESC><p>Synopsis of Proposed Competitive 8(a) Procurement of Detention Services at the El Paso Service Processing Center (SPC) located in El Paso, Texas for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) The forthcoming solicitation will be for detention services to include officers, guards and transportation costs at the El Paso Service Processing Center in El Paso, Texas. The procurement will be 8(a) competitive. The solicitation is expected to be posted before April 1, 2008. The period of performance is expected to be July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009 for the base year plus four one year options. The mission of the Detention and Removal Operations Program (DRO) is the planning, management, and direction of a broad program relating to the supervision, detention and deportation of aliens who are in the United States illegally. These activities are chiefly concerned with enforcement of departure from the US of aliens who have entered illegally or have become removable after admission. In implementing its mission, DRO is responsible for carrying out all orders for the required departure of aliens handed down in removal proceedings, or prior there to, and arranging for detention of aliens when such becomes necessary. DRO maintains and operates the Deportable Alien Control System (DACS) to process cases located by the Border Patrol, Investigations and Inspections activities. Investigative and Border activities locate aliens who are denied entry or further stay in the US and whose departure must be enforced. The Contractor is required, in units housing ICE detainees, to perform in accordance with the most current editions of the ICE Detention Standards, American Correctional Association (ACA) Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities (ALDF), and Standards Supplement, Standards for Health Services in Jails, latest edition, National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC). Some ACA standards are augmented by ICE policy and/or procedure. In cases where other standards conflict with DHSIICE Policy or Standards, DHS/ICE Policy and Standards prevail.

<RESPDATE>050208
<CONTACT>Ellen E. Bell, Senior Advisor to the Director, RTV-1, Phone (617) 494-2491, Email VIIBizModel@volpe.dot.gov - David S. Scali, Chief of Acquisition, RTV-6D, Phone (617) 494-2042
<DESC><p>Request for Information - Response Date: May 2, 2008. The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) is requesting information concerning potential business models for achieving the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) vision. The VII vision is predicated on the existence of ubiquitous, vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle data communication capabilities, which will enable public and private user services to improve roadway safety and, also, enhance mobility, traffic operations, relieve congestion, lessen the environmental impacts of transportation, promote energy conservation, enable electronic payment of transportation-related fares, tolls, and parking fees, as well as allow for user access to the Internet from motor vehicles. Background information on VII is available at the U.S. DOT website, www.its.dot.gov/vii. To date, the VII deployment concept has evolved based on a business model whereby the U.S. DOT would finance and contract for the ongoing operation and maintenance of a nationwide wireless data communications network based on Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology, operating within a 75MHz band of radio spectrum at 5.9GHz established by the Federal Communications Commission with the stipulation that safety-related uses have priority over other applications. In addition it has been assumed that DSRC roadside capabilities would be made operational at 150,000 to 250,000 locations throughout the U.S. in order to provide coverage sufficient to motivate motor vehicle manufacturers to produce DSRC-equipped vehicles. In addition, it has been assumed that the U.S. DOT would be able to acquire the requisite authority to deploy, operate, and maintain a national communications network. To date, revenue sources have not been determined to fully offset the cost of deployment, operations and maintenance of the intended communications capabilities, or the anticipated VII applications. Given limitations on transportation funding, increasing infrastructure construction and rehabilitation needs, along with rising construction costs, the Federal Government seeks information on alternative business models to meet the public sector technical and policy requirements, and also offer opportunities to the private sector for both delivering, operating and maintaining VII infrastructure, as well as creating services that generate economic growth. Information is sought on all aspects of potential business models for delivering the safety, mobility, and traveler convenience benefits sought through VII, particularly strategies that would allow for the accelerated delivery of benefits. The goal of this RFI is to collect sufficient information to frame options for alternative business models, which can serve as a basis for possible redirection of VII program priorities and strategies. In brief: are there ways to enhance the successful development of the VII concept? Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to:1. Reconsider the scope, scale, timing, and associated deployment strategy for VII infrastructure, particularly with respect to DSRC, and the extent to which VII benefits might be realized through the use of alternative wireless communications technologies, recognizing that these may not be able to satisfy the requirements of many safety critical applications. We recognize that different business models might be best suited to each alternative wireless communications technology.2. Explore opportunities for expanded, innovative partnerships, within the private sector, the public sector, or a combination, that more fully involve the consumer electronics and communications industries, in addition to the motor vehicle industry.3. Reconsider roles and responsibilities for the Federal Government, State and local governments, and the private sector. 4. Quantify VII-enabled market opportunities and potential revenue streams that may provide a basis for private or public financing of initial investment and ongoing operations and maintenance costs. 5. Reconsider the suitability of Federal investment versus State or private sector investment for various aspects of the VII concept, along with the related ability to finance such investment from existing or new revenue sources.6. Assess the extent to which the private sector can structure market strategies that would generate sufficient revenues to warrant substantial investment in VII infrastructure deployment, operations, and maintenance.7. Frame options for (an) appropriate business model(s) going forward and facilitate ongoing national dialogue among VII stakeholders. As a result, the Federal Government invites input generally related to the foregoing purposes and detailed information regarding the following: Market Opportunities and Constraintsa) How are strategies for VII infrastructure influenced by its dependence on the interaction among many networks, and by issues including: compatibility and standards; the presence of externalities; the effects of lock-in to a particular architecture; and the impact of scale economies (information privacy)? How are these opportunities or constraints to businesses?b) What market strategies would feasibly result in a nationwide VII system comprising an information infrastructure for traffic management, including roadside and vehicle sensors and associated communications hardware, along with an associated logical network to support control and decision-making at many levels.c) To the extent a highly secure, low latency, broadband communications capability would be necessary for safety-critical applications, what options exist for providing this capability? What disadvantage exists if other applications are deployed based on other communications capabilities? Is the initial vision of a unified wireless communications vehicle to infrastructure interface (hyphenate previous phrase?) for all applications valid? If so, what strategies exist to allow applications to migrate to a unified condition at some future point, recognizing that this may entail a multi-technology approach? d) How will the evolution of the VII infrastructure enable the market for VII enabled goods and services? How will it constrain the market for VII enabled goods and services? e) What do you foresee as the necessary rate of adoption for particular goods or services? How will this be impacted by the build-out of VII infrastructure? f) To what extent will products and services be deployable and cost-effective over a time-phased incremental deployment? What products and services depend upon wide-spread coverage, and how?g) Describe major products and/or services that will be enabled once sufficient VII deployment has been achieved. h) Describe the dependencies involved in the market for goods and services based on VII. In particular, what components of VII are core to delivery of specific products or services?Organizational Decision Makingi) What will encourage participation or hasten participation in a VII-based market? j) Discuss the technical and business risks and describe what actions, public or private, would mitigate those risks. k) In particular, what liability issues are of greatest concern?Outlook for Growthl) Is there sufficient scale in local markets to warrant entry or is ubiquitous national coverage essential to certain application opportunities? m) How do product and service sectors or public entities anticipate creating value or being able to capture value in a VII market environment?n) To support a value chain analysis, describe the value proposition for segments of the market. o) Where are the greatest near-term market opportunities? For example, are these in the extension of existing applications, such as tolling? Technology Requirementsp) Are there alternatives to DSRC which deliver the needed security and data latency requirements, but at lower costs?q) In general, are there technologies that are ready for deployment that offer opportunities for development of new user services?Governance and the Government?s Roler) What is the role for the private sector in operation of the system? Discuss the relationships between efficiency and privacy, and outline the various roles and responsibilities that result. In responding to this RFI and the questions above, please also identify your role as a stakeholder: public agency, private company, and provide a brief description of your organization in terms of size, customer base, revenues, or other appropriate metrics. In addition, please briefly outline your concept for VII deployment to provide the necessary context for considering your response. Information provided in response to this RFI will not be considered confidential unless clearly marked as such. Responses will be made available to other U.S. DOT agencies for the purposes of collaborative VII program planning. Responses will be treated as information only. This request for information is issued for the purpose of obtaining information and data that will be used to help identify and assess alternative business models for VII-related infrastructure. Appropriately marked proprietary information, submitted as a result of this RFI, will be received and protected accordingly by the U.S. Government. Interested parties are requested to submit written responses to this RFI by May 2, 2008. It is highly encouraged that all information submitted be provided electronically, preferably in either Microsoft Word format or Portable Document Format (PDF) to the following e-mail address: VIIBizModel@volpe.dot.gov. The mailing address for responses is VII Business Model Response, RTV-1, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, 55 Broadway, Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02142. In addition to the responses received under this RFI, respondents may be asked to provide additional written information for clarification or to provide more detail via telephone or face-to-face discussions. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to pay for information solicited or received.

The purpose of this amendment is to reopen the solicitation to augment the award pools established for full & open competition and small business concerns in Segments 1-3 to promote additional competition and production capacity.  The solicitation, origina lly issued on September 13, 2002, is for the procurement of various Sets, Kits and Outfits and may be referred to as the SKO solicitation. The term sets, kits, and outfits collectively refers to a wide variety of tools and equipment used to support the Arm y's tactical and combat support weapon systems and its Ordnance and Combat missions.  This amendment will likely result in the award of multiple contracts to expire concurrently with the existing award pool contracts.  A contract under a particular segment will give the awardee the opportunity to compete for future requirements in that Segm ent.  This amendment will not result in the award of a delivery order for any of the sample requirements.   We are soliciting proposals from both large and small businesses.  Delivery Orders will be competed in accordance with the fair opportunity to compete provisions set forth in the original solicitation.  The award of a contract is not a guarantee that an or   der will be placed against that contract.

Segment 5 Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.

These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. UNACCEPTABLE:  The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk,will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives.  This approach has numerous disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are far outweighed by disadvantages.  Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages will not result in satisfactory performance.  The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical.  The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate an understanding of the requirement.  2.  ADD: FAR Clause 52.209-5. 3.  CORRECT: the month that offers are due from Aprio to April.  Offer due date and time has not changed.  4.  There are no further changes.

<DESC><p>Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition and Procurement Office anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price DESIGN-BUILD contract for an auto-activated smoke management/containment system. The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis. The dollar magnitude for this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The performance period is thirty (30) months. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220. A DRAFT statement of work/solicitation will be posted for industry comment. Requirement includes: Design and build a system which would inhibit the flow of smoke into areas of egress, corridors, stairwells and the inner roadway. It would be activated automatically during the early stages of a fire to compartmentalize the smoke and to maintain a survivable environment, e.g. contain the smoke in the fire zone of origin, especially for those personnel evacuating from the more remote corridors and offices. The smoke control system would function during the period of personnel evacuation from the areas protected by the system. Moreover, this system would facilitate search and rescue operations by emergency response personnel. Due to the sensitive nature of the work location, prospective contractors are required to possess an active SECRET facility clearance at the time of proposal submission. All members of the Contractor's design team must have, at minimum, a SECRET security clearance. All personnel seeking a permanent badge must be US citizens and also possess a SECRET security clearance. The geographic location of the work to be performed is southern Pennsylvania near the Maryland border. NOTICE TO OFFERORS: THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THIS SOLICITATION EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE. A DRAFT statement of work/solicitation will be issued on or about 2 April 2008. Comments will be due 16 April 2008. The draft statement or work/solicitation will be posted and available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (EPS) site at www.fbo.gov. Paper copies will not be available. All firms must be registered with the Contractor Registration (CCR) http://www.ccr.gov in order to be eligible for award. All responsible offers will be considered by the agency.</p>
