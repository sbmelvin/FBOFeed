USAID manages development and transition programs in Albania financed through Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) funds.  Total SEED assistance for Albania is about $28 million annually, of which USAID/Albania manages roughly $21.5 million.  In addition to the Director, the Mission is staffed with three Direct Hires (USDHs), six US Personal Service Contractors (USPSCs), and 16 Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs).  The Mission’s Strategic Plan is organized around a Results Framework containing five strategic objectives (SOs), which link with E&E Bureau goals for: strengthened democracy (SO 2.1); civil society and rule of law (SO 2.2); economic restructuring (SO 1.3); health sector reform (SO 4.1); and special initiatives (SO 4.2).

USG interests in reducing corruption in Albania is an important influence on these new directions, so expanded emphasis is being given to rule of law, civil society, democracy, governance, and anti-trafficking of human beings which fall within the above defined SOs.  Based on recent assessments and to streamline management in light of continuing staffing constraints, scopes of work (SOWs) are being developed for a limited number of new umbrella type contracts and grants which will be awarded this fiscal year and early next. The Mission is designing, contracting, and implementing these new mechanism in a carefully phased manner to avoid lapses in the provision of key technical assistance and training to the GOA, NGOs, and the Albanian private sector.
	
As an additional mechanism to strengthen USAID/Albania management under existing OE and staffing constraints, Mission intends to contract for the intermittent services of a Monitoring and Evaluation Advisor (MEA) to provide a management “surge capability” to help deal with peak periods of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) at minimum cost.  As the management services will be focused predominantly on USAID/Albania’s three largest SOs, Mission proposes to fund the position with funds attributable to them.

II. Basic Function of the Position: 

The ultimate goal of the position is for each USAID partner to have in place a functional and systematic Performance Measurement System that can provide relevant, quality data on an on-going basis as requested.  This will be accomplished by the MEA providing guidance and support for the monitoring and evaluation of the portfolios associated with the three primary Mission Strategic Sectors: Democracy and Governance, Economic Reform, and Primary Health Care.  The Advisor will assist SO teams in M&E by providing technical assistance virtually and by holding yearly workshops with SO teams and partners.  These workshops will be follow-up exercises to the initial Performance Management Workshops held in August 2003.  In addition, the Advisor will assist with the preparation of the Annual Report, especially in controlling the quality of the performance table. Additional assistance will be provided virtually on an on-going basis.  

The contract will cover two years, February 2004 through February 2006.  As an intermittent Advisor, the incumbent will perform the bulk of the assignment during a 22 day TDY in June/July of each year to host the Performance Management Workshops, a 35 day TDY to assist in Performance Monitoring Program development and assist any new activities in establishing a functional and systematic Performance Measurement System that can provide relevant quality data systematically on an on-going basis, a 16 day TDY in November/December to help prepare the Annual Report, and 20 days of virtual support.  Much of the TDY work could be done virtually and will depend on the creativity of the incumbent.

<SUBJECT>A -- HETROGENEOUS URBAN RSTA TEAM (HURT)
<SOLNBR>BAA04-05
<RESPDATE>021304
<ARCHDATE>12142004
<CONTACT>John Bay, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-522-7161, Email none - Michael Blackstone, Contracting Officer, Phone (571) 218-4804, Fax (703) 696-2208, Email mblackstone@darpa.mil
<DESC>HETEROGENEOUS URBAN RSTA TEAM (HURT), SOL BAA 04-05, DUE: February 13, 2004; POC: Dr. John Bay, DARPA/IXO; 703-741-7853

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Information Exploitation Office (IXO) is soliciting proposals for the Heterogeneous Urban RSTA (Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition) Team program under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES 
The HURT program will develop technologies enabling mission-driven command and control of a heterogeneous team of uninhabited platforms for the conduct of coordinated urban operations.  The class of uninhabited platforms of particular interest in the HURT program is aerial vehicles.  The roboticized RSTA team, under HURT control, will provide services to warfighters according to user demand as modulated by mission priority subject to resource availability.  HURT technology will be used to decouple users from direct platform control and tasking.  HURT Platform Modeling technologies will provide symbolic representations of platform, payload and algorithm capabilities that allow mission-level planning and tasking.  HURT User Management technologies will permit multiple dispersed users to formulate and register mission-centric service requests and will provide context-dependent service arbitration mechanisms.  HURT Planning and Control technologies will permit tasking/retasking of RSTA team resources based on symbolic representations of available capabilities, mission-level service requests, arbitration policies and subject to operational constraints.  Importantly, technologies developed in HURT will permit rapid integration (disintegration) of platforms into (out of) the team.  HURT will not be pursuing any platform-based autonomy, control, or sensing technologies; only collectively managing and controlling arbitrarily-teamed components.  The HURT program has three objectives.  First, allow warfighters to directly request real-time RSTA services from a team of unmanned assets in complex, three-dimensional urban terrain.  Second, aggregate the information gathering capabilities of diverse platforms into collaborative teams that provide robust services on demand.  Third, control multiple platforms to simultaneously and autonomously maneuver through the urban battlespace in order to deliver those services.  Technical objectives include 1) Developing an expressive platform-independent representation for diverse RSTA assets, to include both mobility and sensing parameters, 2) developing a tasking prioritization mechanism that allows the system to serve RSTA data to multiple users who may lack a complete tactical picture, 3) implementing a planning controller that continuously and robustly serves user requests by appropriately controlling each asset through its native interface, and 4) demonstrating the RSTA team in multi-vehicle tactical experimental scenarios at a MOUT (Military Operations in Urban Terrain) training site.

BAA TOPIC AREAS
This solicitation requests ideas in four topic areas. Proposals may be submitted in any, all, or any combination thereof, of the following HURT research topic areas:
Topic Area 1:  User Management:  Design and construct the user interface mechanism, implementing tactical commands from a nominal original set and augmenting them throughout the program.  Develop the mechanism for accurately prioritizing, queuing, and determining necessary quality-of-service parameters for user requests so that the best service can be achieved subject to commander’s guidance for mission achievement.
Topic Area 2:  Platform Modeling:  Develop and implement the common capability representation, to include platform mobility, sensor models, and the semantics of any on-board autonomy, exploitation, or interoperability that might be available.  The representation must be compatible with the planning and control component.
Topic Area 3:  Planning and Control:  Determine and implement an appropriate planner, task allocator, and controller that accurately matches prioritized user requests with available RSTA team services.  Perform plan monitoring, real-time re-planning, plan repair or a contingency capability for robustness, and manage the return of RSTA data en route back to the user.
Topic Area 4:  System Integration:  Formulate a systems architecture for all the component technologies and assemble the pieces into a coherent, scalable, maintainable, and robust system, with the necessary platform interfaces and data interfaces between all HURT internal components.  Include communications management as necessary.  Interface with military test sites to perform experiment coordination, design, verification/validation, range safety, and data/metrics definition and gathering. Coordinate and lead the field experiments.  It is expected that the System Integrator will provide and maintain a sufficient number of vehicles for development and testing for the duration of the program.

PROGRAM PHASES
HURT will be conducted in three phases, lasting 14 months, 16 months, and 18 months.  Bidders should propose tasks for all three phases, but funding for later phases is entirely contingent upon meeting system-level performance goals established for earlier phases.  
Phase I – Remote Autonomy:  HURT must demonstrate that coordinated autonomy can be achieved through control by the external (i.e., off the platforms) HURT system.  This will require coordinated flight in a small MOUT site with large, well-known obstacles.  The system will have to accomplish the simultaneous tasks of persistent wide-area surveillance and the ability to dispatch a sensor to a single user-designated point for a rapid-reaction close-up look (“911 response”).  
Phase II – Collective Autonomy:  The HURT system must manage diverse assets such that they achieve the collaborative task of maintaining a moving area of regard (AOR) around a moving ground target (e.g., to follow a suspect vehicle, or to maintain a moving zone of blue-force protection).  These tasks will be in addition to the tasks in Phase I. Phase III – Tactical Autonomy:  Through continued consultation with the military user community, develop, implement, and experiment with operationally critical tactical commands to the system.  These tactical scenarios for HURT should illustrate the spectrum of collaborative platform control capabilities, and at a minimum must demonstrate the system’s ability to manage multiple users with conflicting priorities, demonstrate robustness to platform attrition, and implement a line-of-sight (LOS) communications infrastructure to a specified point

Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.      Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  This BAA shall remain open and proposals received up to one year following this BAA’s release.


GENERAL INFORMATION
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) has an electronic upload process for proposal submissions for BAA 04-05. The BAA tool is intended to facilitate an electronic process beginning with the proposal uploads through the review and evaluation of submitted documents.  Instructions for use of the DARPA/IXO BAA Tool are available for download at http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/hurt/index.htm.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated. Proposers must be willing to cooperate and exchange software, data, and other information with other contractors if it contributes to the success of the program.  This includes coordination with a contractor or integrator, chosen by DARPA, if appropriate.  A statement of cooperation must be included in the final proposal.

PROTECTION OF INFORMATION: It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose contents only for the purposes of evaluation and assessment. The Government may use selected support contractor personnel to assist in administrative functions only. Those contractors sign binding, non-disclosure agreements with DARPA.

REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IXO reports.  These reports will be electronically submitted via the DARPA/IXO Technical – Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  

PROPOSAL FORMAT
All Proposers MUST register at: http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa 2 weeks prior to submitting a proposal.  PLEASE NOTE:  The deadline for registration is 30 January 2004, at the URL listed above.  Only the lead or prime Proposer should register.  One registration per proposal should be submitted.  This means that a Proposer wishing to submit multiple proposals should complete a single registration for each proposal.  By registering, the Proposer has made no commitment to submit.  Proposal submissions must be unclassified.  The Proposer must upload the electronic version of the full proposal to the DARPA website by 12:00 PM (ET) Friday, February 13, 2004, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 04-05, HETEROGENEOUS URBAN RSTA TEAM (HURT), will remain open until 12:00 PM (ET), Monday, December 13, 2004.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Monday, December 13, 2004.  While the proposals submitted after Friday, February 13, 2004 deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  Proposers must obtain the BAA 04-05 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and full proposal formats.  The PIP is available for viewing or download at http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/Solicitations/hurt/index.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the PIP may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 04-05 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal Request for Proposals or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.
The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. 

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

Government contractors are required to register at the Government’s Central Contractor Registration site in order to negotiate contracts with most government agencies.  This URL is provided as a reference:  http://www.ccr.gov.  

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical/scientific/business decision process with technical and scientific considerations being most important.  Evaluations will be performed using the following criteria listed in descending order of relative importance:
1.	Relevance to HURT mission objectives
2.	Technical innovation and depth
3.	Consistency with HURT program concepts
4.	Personnel and corporate capabilities and experience
5.	Cost realism and value of proposed work to the Government

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, must be received at BAA04-05@darpa.mil by 12:00 PM (ET) Friday, February 6, 2004.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding BAA 04-05.  Proposals MUST NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.

<DESC>U.S. Department of Energy (DOE):  Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, the DOE is planning a sole source extension to an existing contract (DE-AC01-01IA40017) with the United States Civilian Research and Development Foundation (CRDF) for payment processing and verification support services in the countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  In the absence of applicable Government to Government Agreements, this requirement is jointly held by the; Office of International Affairs,  the Office of Environmental Management; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,  Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology,  Office of Science and Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.  Added to the list of Offices will be the Offices for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) since DOE provides direct administrative and contract support for its agency mission.  These Program Offices have an existing and continuing need to acquire the services of a non-profit entity having confirmed tax-free status in FSU countries.  The planned extension period is twenty-four (24) months, when added to the existing thirty-six (36) months, the total will be sixty-months (60) total, hence the revised ending date will be adjusted to January 17, 2006.  The non-profit entity must clearly demonstrate that is exempt from such taxation or any taxable incident thereof by Russian Federation or other FSU country decree, order, law, or other evidence clearly demonstrating the legality of such exemption from taxation.  Currently, the United States Civilian Research and Development Foundation (CRDF) for the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union,  1530 Wilson Blvd., 3rd Floor, Arlington, VA  22209 is also involved in assisting the payment processing and verification support services to DOE?s/NNSA?s, Office of Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP, NN-24) within the FSU.  CRDF has in-country resources and capabilities in the FSU for making payments to former weapons institutes, scientists, engineers and support staff.  It is DOE?s intent to extend for 24 months, via sole-source modification to its International Affairs Contract all terms of the firm-fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task assignment contract to CRDF for the services described above.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Interested parties having all the capabilities to perform the services described above are requested to send in its capability statements via electronic submission to courtney.byrd@hq.doe.gov , limited to not more than 10 pages, to be received with 30 days of publication of this notice.

<DESC>The USNS Zeus (T-ARC-7) has an obsolete auxiliary boilers' combustion control causing maintenance and operational difficulties.  Military Sealift Command (MSC) has decided to replace the existing ACC boiler control system with a modern PLC type (boiler control) combustion control system.  MSC is requesting quotes from qualified small businesses that can design, procure and install an approved ABS/USCG commercial off the shelf packaged (COTS) PLC automatic combustion/boiler control system, using state of the art technology, interfaced to control the auxiliary boilers on the ZEUS.  The COTS boiler system shall be in accordance with all ABS, USCG and MSC guidelines.  The new system will be reliable, durable and applicable for future improvements and have service accessibility.  The hardware and software for the boiler control system design shall be factory tested by the contractor before installation and be ABS/USCG approved.  The contractor will also test the boiler control system for the proper operation after installation.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be a 100% small business set-aside.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego, intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, Commercial Contract with option items to Hafmynd-GAVIA LTD., Fiskislod 73, 101 Reykjavik, Iceland, IS-101. The procurement will be a sole source acquisition pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.5. The contractor shall provide one commercial GAVIA Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) with modules, auxiliary equipment, and a 5-day operator-training course. Option items include an additional UUV with various modules, auxiliary equipment, and a 5-day operator-training course. This sole source acquisition has been approved by Office of the Secretary of Defense, Foreign Comparative Test Program. The US Navy is currently incorporating small UUVs into Navy Special Warfare, very shallow water (10 to 40ft seawater depth) Mine Countermeasure operations and Anti-terrorism Force Protection tactics. Two major tenets of this small UUV strategy are autonomous UUVs capable of being deployed by 2 persons from a small boat and easily removable ?plug and play? component modularity to facilitate current and future flexible sensor integration for ongoing Military missions. No other small UUVs investigated and assessed have the removable ?plug and play? modularity and flexible sensor integration that allows modules, rapid sensor reconfiguration and battery replacement to be replaced within minutes. The delivery schedule is anticipated to be approximately six months from contract award and the option items, if procured are anticipated to be delivered within one year of contract award. The North American Industry Classification Code is 334511 and the FSC code is 5895. The estimated Firm Fixed Price value is approximately $540,000.00. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotation.

The Government may make an award resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation provisions, will be the most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  The Statement of Work is as follows: I.  BACKGROUND a.  Overview:  Public Law (P.L.) 100-497, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) provides the statutory framework for the conduct of Indian tribal gaming.  The Act divides Indian gaming into three classes and defines Class II in relevant part as: Gaming that includes the game of bingo as well as pull-tabs, lotto, instant bingo, and other games similar to bingo (if played in the same location as bingo), whether or not Aelectronic, computer or other technologic aids@ are used.  1.  Tribes now offer interlinked electronic bingo, games similar to bingo and pull tabs played with Aelectronic, computer or other technologic aids@ as part of their Class II gaming.  Distinctions in the characteristics of these devices and their manner of play, compared to the characteristics and manner of play of other gaming devices, particularly Class III devices, are relevant to determining the gaming activity classification and whether the gaming is subject to the requirement for tribal-state compacts. 2.  IGRA defines the game of bingo and establishes the fundamental requirements for play of the game as a Class II activity.  The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC or Commission) regulations define other key relevant terms not defined by the Act, including Aelectronic, computer, or other technologic aid,@ Aelectronic or electromechanical facsimile@ and Agame similar to bingo.@ 3.  The NIGC has issued guidance for interpretation of the Class II requirements and the statutory elements of bingo through Commission bulletins and with advisory game classification opinions by its Office of General Counsel.  The Commission intends to establish technical standards for these devices in a Commission regulation as a means of ensuring that gaming offered though the use of Aelectronic, computer or other technologic aids@ by tribes is permissible as a Class II gaming activity and seeks advice in developing this regulation.   4.  The regulation and the technical standards will incorporate the legal requirements for Class II gaming and prescribe the general features and functions of an Aelectronic, computer, or other technologic aid@ that can be used in Class II gaming.  These technical standards will provide key distinctions between machine gaming activity that is Class II and other machine the gaming utilizing Aelectronic or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance or slot machines of any kind,@ which is Class III gaming.   5.  The Commission intends also that the regulation establish the parameters for an enforcement or compliance program that relies on the technical standards.  A Class II gaming device must be certified as meeting the technical standards before that device may be used for Class II play. 6.  The contract shall include technical services that involve research, interpretation and use of technical data.  The work requires experience and understanding of the operation and regulation of gaming devices by government entities.  A thorough understanding of comparable governmental regulatory efforts and ability to draft technical regulations relating to the design, functionality and operation of gaming devices is required.  b.  Purpose:  The Commission seeks expert support in drafting a regulation that will establish technical standards for Class II gaming devices used by Indian tribes.  Additionally, an enforcement and compliance program (to monitor the continued use of the devices) will be required. 1.  The technical standards will provide key factors to distinguish the design, use and play of class II Aelectronic computer, or other technologic aids@ from the design, use, and play of Aelectronic or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance or slot machines," which is a Class III gaming activity.   2.  Following project completion, of the project, the Commission expects to adopt Class II technical standards as a regulation having the force of law.  The regulation will provide an important tool in the Commission=s exercise of its regulatory responsibilities, for both Class II and Class III gaming, by assisting gaming tribes and the gaming industry in distinguishing between these forms of machine gaming. c.  Summary of actions and expected results:  The contractor shall apply its gaming regulation knowledge, understanding of the laws and regulations applicable to Indian gaming, experience in drafting technical standards and regulations, and, working with Commission staff, provide a draft regulation that establishes technical standards applicable to Class II gaming devices used by Indian tribal gaming operations.   1.  The regulation and the technical standards will implement requirements for Class II gaming found in other Commission regulations and prescribe the general features and functions of an Aelectronic, computer, or other technologic aid@ that can be used in Class II gaming.  The regulation will also establish the parameters for an enforcement or compliance program that relies on the technical standards such that a gaming device offered for Class II play by a tribal gaming operation would be certified as meeting the technical standards before that device could be used for Class II play.   2.  The Contractor shall work with Commission staff to draft a proposed regulation that will be presented to an advisory committee established by the Commission.  The advisory committee will assist in forming the draft into a proposed regulation that, when approved by the Commission, will be submitted for public comment.  Following a period for public comment(s) and evaluation of such comment(s) by the contractor, advisory committee, and Commission, the Commission expects to adopt a final agency rule based on the draft rule developed by the contractor and publish the rule as part of the Code of Federal Regulations.   d.

The Commission will accept the initial draft or require modification to the draft and will notify the contractor in writing, unless otherwise agreed, regarding necessary changes.  When the Commission agrees with the initial draft, it will be presented to an advisory committee established by the Commission.   The Commission will require the contractor to evaluate comment provided by the advisory committee and make appropriate changes to the initial draft.  The Commission representative to the advisory committee will make the determination on whether a particular change proposed by the advisory committee is accepted for inclusion in the draft.  The Commission will accept the revised draft by adopting the draft as a proposed rule by majority vote, or will reject the draft and return the draft to the contractor for modification.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

2. ISSUANCE DATE: December 2, 2003
3. CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED  
   FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: December  23, 2003
4. POSITION TITLE: Intermittent Senior Multi-sector Advisor  – USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $ 85,140.00 - $ 110,682.00 per annum  (GS 15 – equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: To be determined, but not to exceed 120 days annually
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

I.   Background:

USAID manages development and transition programs in Kosovo financed through Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) funds.  Total SEED assistance for Kosovo is about $85 million annually, of which USAID/Kosovo manages roughly $31 million.  The Mission recently completed a new five-year Strategic Plan organized around a Results Framework containing five strategic objectives (SOs) – SO 1.2, Improved Policy and Institutional Climate for Private Investment; SO 1.3, Accelerated Growth of the Private Sector, SO 2.1, Civil Society and government are more effective partners in achieving good governance, and SO 2.2, More Open and Responsive Government Acting According to the Rule of Law,and SO 4.1, Special Initiatives (health, energy, and anti-trafficking). An additional program objective, 4.2, implements cross-cutting programs such as training and education.  The new strategic plan also identified five cross-cutting themes that will influence work undertaken in the strategic areas noted above.  They include conflict mitigation, specifically returns and reintegration, corruption, gender, youth, and human capacity development.  

In order to effectively implement the newly-approved strategy, numerous project designs are contemplated for the next year. The Mission is designing, contracting and implementing these new mechanisms in a carefully phased manner to avoid lapses in the provision of key technical assistance and training to the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the Kosovar government, NGOs, and the Kosovar private sector.

As an additional mechanism to strengthen Mission management under existing staffing constraints, Mission intends to contract for the intermittent services of a Senior Multi-sector Advisor (SMA) to provide a management “surge capability” to help deal with peak periods of SO management.  

II.  Basic Function of the Position: 

The incumbent will serve intermittently as a SMA, who will provide program guidance and support for the design, implementation and monitoring of the portfolios associated with the primary Mission Strategic Sectors: Democracy and Governance and Economic Reform.  The Advisor will assist SO teams and participate in activity development, implementation, monitoring, and results reporting.  As an intermittent Advisor, the incumbent will perform the work of the assignment during a series of up to 4 TDYs totaling not more than 120 days annually.

III.  Major Duties and Responsibilities:

Serves as an expert advisor and technical authority on complex and, often, precedent-setting policy and activity issues, developing policies, strategies, and plans for development assistance programs for Mission SO teams and implementing partners. Incumbent will provide specialized expertise to Mission Offices and SO Teams in designing and monitoring policies, strategies, and programs.  For the primary SOs, provides support in drafting and finalizing activity and team reporting documents.  SMA advises Mission SO teams on new developments, and the most effective approaches to problems of development assistance in the country, and articulates the benefits of interventions to effectively reach specific target audiences.  Incumbent will provide technical advice, guidance, and support to Mission SO teams on technical and related program issues regarding the design, implementation, management, and evaluation of activities and activity portfolios.  In role of acting SO team leader, provides technical liaison with other USG Agencies, other donor organizations, multilateral banks, PVOs/NGOs, and other organizations to coordinate their efforts with specific USAID SO programs, activity portfolios and approaches in Kosovo.

SMA provides technical and managerial guidance for Mission SO research topics and activity-specific issues.  S/he coordinates incorporation of the research findings into implementable interventions within the Mission SO portfolios.  Provides expert advice and state-of-art professional assistance and support on policy, activity and SO portfolio implementation planning issues in development assistance.  

Incumbent provides assistance to SO teams and their partners in the organization and management of performance reviews and assessments.  Based on the outcomes, SMA assists SO teams in developing or modifying annual procurement plans and in adjusting the design of new/ongoing activities, as appropriate.  Over the course of the assignment, the Advisor will organize and conduct internal performance reviews of the activity portfolios of each Mission SO.  SMA assists selected SO Teams in the design and oversight of sectoral and multi-sectoral assessments, and special topic analyses.    

Maintains knowledge of current literature in order to advise USAID/Kosovo to facilitate and coordinate activities in selected SO development assistance areas.  Attends conferences and meetings for the purposes of professional interchange, and establishes and maintains effective working relationships with colleagues and institutions in related fields.

Prepares, or oversees the preparation of activity and SO authorizations, funding documentation, and related implementation letters.  Incumbent participates, as requested, in the review of contractor selection and approval, including preparing related documents such as invitations for bid, and plans and specifications for professional services.  Coordinates, as required, the evaluation of activities and activity portfolios to ascertain impact and cost effectiveness, including implications for future activities.   

Advisor plays a key role in development and review of USAID/Kosovo SO activities and activity portfolios.  Ensures all phases of project and non-project activity are developed to meet technical, legal, financial, statutory, regulatory and policy requirements.  As needed, assists SO Teams in developing SOWs for sector-level assistance initiatives and interventions.         

Incumbent utilizes research findings to assist respective SO teams to refine overall efforts to achieve SOs and associated intermediate results, taking into consideration decreased budgets and other constraints.  Analyzes trends with respect to the implications for selected Mission SOs and makes recommendations for action to SO teams and team leaders.  As directed, organizes and leads internal SO team exercises to identify the parameters of new assistance initiatives and interventions. 

Performs other duties as assigned.

IV.   Management Controls

The Advisor will report to the Program Officer or his/her designee.  S/he will be expected to function with a high degree of autonomy within general USAID policies and management guidelines.  When functioning as acting SO team leader, the SMA will exercise the same supervisory functions as the team leader.

<DESC>This posting is being accomplished to add Amendment 0003 and to put all the amendments together in one document.  Amendment 0003 is being issued to answer questions submitted on December 04, 2003.  Questions (Q) and Answers (A).  (Q1) Is the contractor required to monitor relevant Linux news, mailing lists, and other relevant sites to know when a patch must be created, or is the contractor notified by NOAA when a patch is required?  (A1) The contractor is not required to monitor mailing lists and other news sources.  NOAA will ask for the patches that are required.  But the contractor should note that security patches must be provided within five business days of when they are requested, so the contractor may gain valuable lead time by monitoring web sites that announce security vulnerabilities.  (Q2) Once the updated RPMs are created, do they become full property of the NOAA?  If specific code level changes are required to the supplied patches, per the GPL these must be re-released under the GPL.  Does the NOAA have a restriction against this?  May the contractor have license to redistribute these RPMs in any capacity? (A2) NOAA places no restrictions on what the contractor may do with any software created under this contract.  NOAA gets full use of the software, with no restrictions on use other than those imposed by the GPL or whatever other public license the underlying software may be governed by.  The contractor retains the same rights.  (Q3) Since service is expected to begin on January 1, 2004, by what date will the decision be made as to which contractor is chosen?  (A3) On current schedule, the decision will be announced by December 19, 2003.  The Government will not make its first request for a patch until at least two weeks have elapsed after award announcement.  (Q4) In regards to Past Performance, would you classify general Linux patching experience as more or less important than general C programming experience?  (A4) The Government expects that the major work required by this contract will be taking publicly available source code patches and building and re-packaging them for the specific distribution being patched.  So while experience in both C programming and patch preparation are important, patch preparation is more important.  We do not expect a significant amount of new C programming will be required for this task.  Amendment 0002 is being issued to add the Red Hat versions 7.3 and 9 to the support coverage.  Follow the below instructions when submitting.  Address these two versions separately as shown below.  Provide pricing separately and then pricing for all four versions.  (End of Amendment 0002)  Amendment 0001 is being issued to provide Questions and Answers, to include version 8.0 as part of the support, and to require separate technical and pricing submissions for three scenarios.  Questions (Q) and Answers (A):  (Q1) What type of support does the Government require?  Is it 24/7 or normal business hours?  (A1) The most important element of support is provision of patches.  The vendor should place the patches on a server that the Government can access at the Government’s convenience via ftp or sftp.  Other requests for support will be rare, and will be during normal business hours.  (Q2) Will the support require onsite, offsite, or a combination of both support?  (A2) The Government expects that requests for support (other than provision of patches) will be rare.  Such requests will usually be handled by telephone, but it is possible that visits to Government integration and test facilities in the Washington Metropolitan Area may be required.  (Q3) How many systems will require Red 7.2 patch/driver support?  (A3) The Government will handle all patch deployment and other “per machine” issues, so the number of systems involved should not be relevant.  User-level support is handled by currently existing engineering staff.  Somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 machines are involved.  Up to two NWS programs may be involved, so there will be at most two different machine configurations.  (Q4) Will the Government furnish equipment at the contractor’s site for testing of developed patches/drives?  (A4) No. Routine testing of patches may be done on commodity Intel x86 hardware with the contractor is expected to own.  Testing of hardware-specific patches may require visits to the Government’s integration and test facilities in the Washington Metropolitan Area.  (Q5) How does the Government require the deployment of patches/drivers?  By onsite, offsite link, or best means method?  The Government recommends that the patches be loaded on to the contractor’s ftp or sftp server.  Up to three Government IP addresses should be granted access to the server to download patches.  Contractor’s server should have a reliable internet connection providing data transfer speed of at least 600 kilobits per second.  According to the commercial definition and the performance based acquisition solution, the contractor needs to come up with the best solution that will meet the Government’s needs.  The contractor must be able to stand by any solution provided to the Government.  (Q6) Will the Government provide the contractor any office/test bench space at the Government location?  (A6) If onsite testing or consultation is required, the Government will provide the necessary access and facilities on an ad-hoc basis.  (Q7) Does the Government require a Time and Material or a Cost Plus quotation?  (A7) The Government is expecting a firm-fixed price quotation.  This is a commercial acquisition and commercial acquisition can only be firm-fixed price methodology.  If the contractor is asked to provide additional services besides supporting the Red Hat, the contractor will need to provide labor categories and labor rates for that type of work.  The Government will provide a line item for a not-to-exceed amount for this particular purpose.  (End of Questions and Answers)  All additional information will be shown within the solicitation via quotations.  (End of Amendment 0001)

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Des Moines, Iowa is seeking assistance from private sector individuals, firms and entities to assist clients to develop nutrient management plans in various counties in Iowa.  These nutrient management plans are for private individuals and are being developed as one component of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, commonly referred to as the 2002 Farm Bill.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items and support necessary to provide the services as solicited.  

The period of performance will be from February 1, 2004 to September 30, 2004.  It is estimated that each typical nutrient management plan will require approximately three (3) staff days of assistance to complete.  Contracts will likely comprise from 6 to 50 nutrient management plans in one or more counties in Iowa.  Some plans will include utilization of livestock manure, some will not.

Nutrient management plans shall be developed in accordance with all applicable NRCS policy and criteria which can be found at the following websites: NRCS Field Office Technical Guide, http://efotg.nrcs.usda.gov.  Emphasis will be placed on utilizing local data and information to implement the "Considerations" section of the Nutrient Management Standard (590).  Nutrient management plan development will require an understanding of agronomy, soil conservation and nutrient management practices, and good communication skills.  Some nutrient management plans may be a component of a Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plan for livestock operations.  The respondents must now be or must demonstrate the ability to become certified Technical Service Providers (TSP) in the category of 'Nutrient Management - Organic and Inorganic' within 45 days of contract award.  Information about TSP certification is available at http://techreg.usda.gov/.   Questions relating to this process may be directed to Mr. Thomas O'Connor at (515)-323-2224, or e-mail at tom.oconnor@ia.usda.gov   .
Proposals from contractors will be evaluated on technical capability, personnel qualifications, past performance and price.  This is a pre-solicitation notice.  A separate "Request for Proposal" will be advertised for each of the selected counties or groups of counties in Iowa, as soon as workload areas are identified.

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to a technical question submitted and extend the due date for quotations by one (1) day.***The due date for quotes is hereby changed as follows: FROM: Monday, December 8, 2003 at 3:00 PM 
Eastern Time TO: Tuesday, December 9, 2003 at 3:00 PM Eastern Time.  QUESTION:  Do you want out-of-the-box software to control the camera or should it be customized and what features do you want to control.  ANSWER:  No customization except that NIST wants to be able to control the camera remotely via interface to the computer - not necessarily the same used for data transfer - e.g., could be separate GPIB or RS-232 port. Ready-to-use drivers for Labview or Active X drivers are preferred, but as long as the software codes for control functions are identified and can be sent to the camera, NIST can work with that.  Should be able to control all camera functions that would be controllable via manual settings, including frame acquisition and transfer to computer, exposure (integration time), activation or override of any automatic control such as exposure controls, number of frames to acquire, binning, number of frames to be acquired into local memory, switching to subframe rapid scan mode for focus, control of cooling fan speed.

<DESC>Request for Information for Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) Advanced Handle Registration Service



1.0	SUBJECT

Request for Information (RFI) for the enhancement of the existing DTIC’s Handle Service software to support handle registration, validation, link checking, maintenance, and relational linking of all supported Department of Defense (DOD) digital documents. Alternately, DTIC is willing to entertain the acquisition of a turn-key or near turn-key system providing the same functionality. In addition, any turn-key solution must also provide handle resolution, a proxy server capability, and the ability to search DTIC’s handle registry. Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on January 31, 2004.  See section 7.0 for further information.


2.0	DESCRIPTION

DTIC is the central facility for the collection and dissemination of scientific and technical information for the Department of Defense (DoD).  DTIC serves as a vital link in the transfer of information among DoD personnel, DoD contractors and potential contractors and other U.S. Government agency personnel and their contractors.  Users can search DTIC’s publicly accessible collections and display or download scientific and technical information, using the Public Scientific and Technical Information Network (STINET) service.  Currently, Handles are assigned to all of the STINET full-text PDF documents.

DTIC’s current Handle Service assigns permanent names called “Handles” to electronic resources, and stores them in its Handle Service.  The current location (or URL) where the resource can be found is stored with each Handle.  When the location changes, the Handle record is updated to reflect this change.  Handles, by themselves, do not describe the resources they identify.  Metadata enables the user to find out what a resource is without having to inspect it.  DTIC’s metadata table provides ‘kernel metadata’ – very limited bits of data describing a resource.  The current DTIC’s Handle metadata comprises 6 fields (Title, Report Number, DTIC Accession Number, Corporate Author, Personal Author, and Publication Year).  The Handles, metadata, and URL are stored in an Oracle database. 

However, DTIC Handle Service simply points each Handle to a single URL and doesn’t have the capability to automatically link to related content.  DTIC now desires to enhance its Handle Service and is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of Advanced Handle Registration Service.  The additional metadata fields will probably be required to implement the desired functionality.

Specifically, this RFI seek the following information:

Technical alternatives
•	Technical feasibility alternatives assessments
•	Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives
•	Schedule estimates
•	Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing Advanced Handle Registration Service.


3.0	FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the functional requirements for Advanced Handle Registration Service.

•	Assign permanent names called “Handles” to DTIC electronic resources and store them in the Handle Service (the current location, or URL where the resource can be found is stored with each Handle).

•	Register DTIC metadata and Handles for digital documents.

•	Automatically create and/or update Handles and maintain Handle directory.

•	Automatically establish Handle links to related content without human intervention.  Each Handle should be able to point to many related URLs, instead of single URL.  This functionality includes automatic linking of related publications on the same topic, on the same contract, by the same author(s), from the same organization.

•	Automatically validate and QA all links prior to registration into the global Handle system.

•	On an ongoing basis, validate, QA and automatically link all Handles, both retrospectively in time and prospectively, so that all new publications are automatically linked to older related publications, and vice-versa.

•	Regularly ping all Handles and links to ensure that all links are current.

•	Provide and support the software component to display the link menus on DTIC’s site.  The link menus will display different options available to facilitate the interaction between the customer and the content options.  

•	The menu options will include reference to DTIC Home Page, Search STINET, Buy the Document (display STINET Shopping Cart), among other options.

•	The software for displaying the link menus will have the capability to allow for the selective suppression or inclusion of different links depending on where the Handle appears on DTIC’s site or others’ site.  For example, certain links could be visible only to authorize users as opposed to the general public, or certain links would only appear on DTIC’s site but not on the sites of other DOD agencies which display DTIC Handles on their own sites.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about the requirements specified above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.




4.0	POSSIBLE ADVANED HANDLE REGISTRATION SERVICE SOLUTION

Advanced Handle Registration Service must meet the functional requirements specified in section 3.0.  The Government is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.


5.0	SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE

Following is a suggested outline for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the Government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit.

Section 1 – Conceptual Alternatives

Briefly describe one or more alternative solution concepts for DTIC Advanced Handle Registration Service to meet the functional requirements in section 3.  Each alternative solution should discuss how it could meet each of the listed functional requirements.

Section 2 – Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks involved.

Section 3 – Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost estimate for each alternative for non-recurring and annual-recurring costs.  Also, discuss schedule considerations.

Section 4 – Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, and other information you deem relevant.  In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI.



6.0	DISCLAMINER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI will be marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  The responses to this notice will not be considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The contractor will need to have proven expertise in conducting quick response and comprehensive assessments in areas such as aircraft certification, design, and manufacturing.  In addition, the contractor will need to have ready access to industry experts, aircraft manufacturing market data and commercial aviation safety records.

III.  SCOPE

The contractor will provide analyses and information to support a review of aviation manufacturers’ certification data.  Contractor findings will be summarized in reports to the OIG based on pre-established timetables.  The specific requirements, format, and timing of the reports will be determined on a task-by-task basis.  Payment for services will be contingent on the OIG’s approval and acceptance of the contractor’s finished products.

Any travel required to perform contract tasks will be approved in advance by OIG.  Travel costs will be billed at established government travel rates.

Work tasks will be initiated and accepted by designated representatives from the OIG Office of Aviation.  

IV.  TASK STATEMENT
IV	
The contractor will provide systems analysis, engineering support and technical expertise in review of aircraft and aircraft parts certification.  Areas for which contractor support may be requested include, but are not limited to:

-	Systems analyses of FAA’s certification and validation process for domestic and foreign transport category aircraft and aircraft parts to determine compliance with regulations, and to identify safety issues and any weaknesses in the process;
	
-	Analyses of aircraft accident and incident data, Service Difficulty Reports, and Airworthiness Directives to identify trends with aircraft models or components on aircraft models that could be linked to aircraft certification or design issues.  For any trends identified, contractor will  select a sample of the trends and trace the issues through the aircraft design and certification process to determine if similar problems were identified during the certification process and how those problems were addressed (sample quantity will be discussed with and approved by OIG); and, 
	
-	Engineering analyses of six certifications of U.S. and foreign manufactured aircraft (including derivative aircraft) and aircraft parts, including both existing and in-process certifications, to determine safety concerns and compliance with regulations.
	
•	For both completed and in process certification projects, obtain and review, at a minimum, the following documentation (if available) to identify safety issues and noncompliance with regulations:

a.	The Certification Program Plan,
b.	The Compliance Checklist,
c.	Issue Papers or Certificate Review Items, 
d.	The Certification Summary Report,
e.	The Type Inspection Report,
f.	The Special Certification Review,
g.	Any relevant correspondence between the manufacturer and FAA,
h.	Any correspondence or documentation from Chief Scientists and Technical Advisors, and
i.	Any correspondence or documentation from the Aircraft Evaluations Group.

•	In addition, for completed certification projects: (1) determine the validity of the assumptions made for testing the product, (2) determine if the appropriate Chief Scientists and Technical Advisors were involved in the process and the input they provided, and (3) determine the percentage of the certification process that FAA personnel completed and the percentage that FAA’s designated representatives.

The contractor will meet with assigned OIG representatives to clarify review and reporting requirements prior to beginning work on assigned tasks.  After this meeting, the contractor will provide OIG with a written summary of their understanding of the work requirements, the products to be provided, the anticipated timetable, and any projected changes to the estimated cost for completing the assigned work.

The contractor will submit a draft report to the OIG for review and acceptance and will make changes to this draft as determined necessary by the OIG.

VIII. DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT

(a)	GENERAL PROVISION.

For proper performance of Office of Inspector General business and to maintain the objectivity and independence of the Office, prior to the issuance of a task order, the Contracting Officer must determine that the Contractor has no organizational conflict of interest in the particular proposed activity or site specific project, and is otherwise available in terms of projected workload capacity.  Contractors shall certify that they are not aware of any organizational conflict of interest situations at the time the contract is awarded and agree not to enter into any contract that will create or appear to create a conflict of interest for the Inspector General.

For the purposes of this contract, the term “organizational conflict of interest” means a situation where a contractor has interest, either due to its activities or its relationships with other organizations, which place it in a position that may be unsatisfactory or unfavorable (1) from the Government’s standpoint in being able to secure impartial, technically sound, objective assistance and advice from the contractor, or in securing the advantages of adequate competition in its procurement; or (2) from industry’s standpoint in that unfair competitive advantage may accrue to the contractor in question.  

(b) REQUIREMENTS.

The Contractor must comply with the following requirements.

i.	Sign a Declaration of Independence and Organizational Conflict of Interest Statement that no conflicts of interest exist for the Contractor, its affiliates, or subcontractors that would preclude performance of the required services.
	
ii.	Notify and provide in writing to the Office of Inspector General, a list of any contracts the contractor has had with the Federal Aviation Administration, airlines and aviation manufacturers during the past 5 years, as well as those currently under contract, and the general scope of work performed for each.   
	
iii.	Notify and provide in writing to the Office of Inspector General a list of any potential new contracts or work involving either the Federal Aviation Administration or others in the field of aviation, including airlines and manufacturers, that might pose a conflict of interest.   

      iv.   The Office of Inspector General will evaluate the list of contracts in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards to determine if there are any real or apparent conflicts of interest that could impair the objectivity and independence of the work product.  If it is determined that there is such a conflict of interest, the government will notify the contractor that the proposal will not be considered under this task order.  If there is a potential conflict of interest, the OIG may, in its sole discretion, seek to determine whether actions are available to alleviate or mitigate the potential conflicts of interest that allow the performance of the proposed order to be accomplished in an impartial and objective manner.  In the event a conflict of interest is discovered after the award of this task order, the OIG may terminate the task order at no cost to the Government.       


(c) EXAMPLES.

The following examples illustrate, but are not inclusive of, situations in which questions concerning conflict of interest may arise.

i. Employing a former employee of the Office of Inspector General or the entity to be audited who has information that enables the Contractor to gain an unfair competitive advantage.

ii. Auditing a system that was developed or designed by the Contractor or an employee of the Contractor.

(d) PENALTIES.

If the Contractor fails to comply with the above requirements, it may be considered a material breach of the contract subject to monetary penalty and termination for default or other legal action, such as debarment from future Federal contracts.

(e) CERTIFICATION.
I certify that I have read and fully understand the above information and what is required under the contract concerning organizational conflict of interest.

<DESC>This synopsis is issued for informational and planning purposes only. The United States Transportation Command and the AMC Contracting Flight is conducting market research and desires input from industry to help in requirements planning. The information requested by this Request For Information will be used within the United States Transportation Command to facilitate decision-making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Please note that the United States Transportation Command will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request for information. The United States Transportation Command is researching the feasibility and cost effectiveness of commercial solutions and state of the art technology to meet current and projected information system requirements. In considering new system solutions, the United States Transportation Command must give careful consideration to successful transition and migration from existing legacy systems to preclude a lapse in or degradation of services provided to our many DoD customers. 

INTRODUCTION:  The AMC Contracting Flight is seeking information in support of the United States Transportation Command for innovative research and prototype development that demonstrates utility of automatic identification technology (AIT), with emphasis on radio frequency identification (RFID) to enhance the efficiency of the Defense Transportation System (DTS) in managing Department of Defense (DOD) cargo and supply deployment through ports.  The Defense Transportation System is that portion of the nation's transportation infrastructure, which supports DOD common-user transportation needs across the range of military operations. It consists of those common-user military and commercial assets, services, and systems organic to, contracted for, or controlled by the DOD. USTRANSCOM relies on transportation services and information systems to help ensure that cargo, supplies, and personnel are conveyed to designated locations as quickly as possible during peace and war. Information is needed to improve the performance of functions like deploying troops for wartime, packing and shipping cargo for transport, and drawing plans for ship loading. Because today’s defense strategies use fewer forward deployed troops and equipment, the transportation function and the information systems supporting it have become increasingly important. Yet the source of information regarding the type of characteristics of cargo, it origin and destination, and mode and source of movement remains largely a manual effort.  The capability to capture timely and accurate information concerning unit strategic deployments, sustainment cargo, intra-theater moves, and continental United States (CONUS) non-unit cargo movements is essential to support Defense Transportation System (DTS) mode determination and optimization and visualization capabilities.  This requires visibility at the content  (National Stock number, nomenclature and dimensional) level of detail for all shipments with specific identifiable timeline requirements. Effective and efficient scheduling of deployment requirements depends upon an accurate description of movement requirements. Knowing exactly what has to be loaded onto a lift asset as well as the nature of cargo that must be diverted within the deployment flow is key to ensuring the best use of DTS assets as well as providing the combatant commander with status on deploying equipment and sustainment into his area of responsibility (AOR).  Source data automation is the enabling of operators on the ground to provide information to develop realistic schedules as well as update the plan versus what is actually happening during a deployment. Currently, this planned versus actual data is not effectively updated at key nodes where the revised information may or may not be manually input and even if correctly input, may not be transmitted to and processed by all of the systems that require visibility and use of the data in question. This shortfall creates an information vacuum and directly results in a loss of in-transit visibility (ITV) at the entry point into the DTS.  As this information and notification of changes is poorly managed at the DTS node, exceptions to the plan are not input effectively and therefore, are not flagged. Further, management systems do not receive corrections or updates thereby losing the ability to efficiently and effectively respond to requirements from the customer prior to the customer understanding that he has a requirement due to an existing delta between the plan and reality. Combining the capabilities of common-user transportation assets into an integrated network optimizes the use of airlift, sealift, and land transportation resources, provides greater visibility over operations, and eases the transition from peace to war. In this regard, the aggregate transportation capability exercised through the DTS is a critical enabling instrument that allows the DOD to support National Security Strategy.  Resources are controlled and operated by separate military organizations reporting to USTRANSCOM and by hundreds of commercial companies operating aircraft, trucks, ships, busses, and ports under contract to the DOD.  

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:  The US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is considering an aggressive two-phase demonstration program for RF Identification (RFID) in support of the DTS. USTRANSCOM would investigate RFID and associated technologies to provide asset visibility and supply chain management.  This program is not intended to develop new technologies, but rather to transfer existing active and passive RFID technologies from the commercial sector into the DTS.  Phase I of the program would explore, through an intensive six-month effort, innovative applications of RFID technology in the DTS. Following publication and acceptance of a “Proof of Concept” Demonstration Plan, Phase II, would demonstrate the use of existing technology to identify and track items being shipped via commercial and military assets to Department of Defense activities and locations worldwide. Items include unit equipment, consumables, containers, and 463L pallets. As part of the Proof of Concept phase, a thorough assessment would be made of the operation and supportability costs associated with implementation of RFID technology.  Areas of interest include:  (1) Collective suite of AIT applications in DOD identifying and tracking deployment and sustainment movement requirements at DTS nodes; (2) DOD automated information systems (AIS) supporting use of AIT; (3) DOD Business processes supported by AIS; (4) High data capacity active RFID tags;  (5) Optimum mix of active and passive RFID tags to identify individual items and contents of containers and pallets;  (6) Leveraging Electronic Product Code (EPC) and compatible RFID tags.

INFORMATION REQUESTED: Contractors are requested to submit the following information in the format of a White Paper as outlined below. The white paper should be concise (no more than 20 pages) and address only the information requested below. Again, this information will support market research activities within the United States Transportation Command in support of the USTRANSCOM’s requirements. Any resultant United States Transportation Command requirement for this system will be addressed in a subsequent synopsis announcement. I. Company Information (General): II. Past Performance Information (Specific): Identify system solutions that you have provided to either DoD specific or other commercial customers that are considered to be very similar to the utility of automatic identification technology (AIT), with emphasis on radio frequency identification (RFID) to enhance the efficiency of the Defense Transportation System (DTS) in managing Department of Defense (DOD) cargo and supply deployment through ports requirements outlined in this synopsis. For each project referenced, include the name of the customer, a point of contact (include their phone number and e-mail address), and a brief description of the technology solution delivered. These references must be recent, within the last 3 years. III. Capabilities (General): Generally describe your company’s commercial systems solutions that may fulfill the United States Transportation Commands requirements. The United States Transportation Command is not asking for disclosure of specific or detailed innovative solutions here. The United States Transportation Command is interested in the availability of existing or proposed commercial technology solutions, which could be included in phase one of proposed demonstration program.  Rough Estimate of Cost and Schedule: Provide an estimate (or range) of estimated costs for the phase one as well as phase two systems (to include acquisition, installation and test implementation. A timeline for system delivery and transition is also requested. Timeline should begin with the date of contract award. V. Identify Major Risks: Provide general information as to the major risks anticipated in conversion to your new system given our existing legacy system. (Performance/Cost/Schedule). VI. Any Other Information Deemed Useful to the United States Transportation Command. SUBMISSION INFORMATION: The White Paper should be submitted by 12 Jan 04 via E-mail to Nancy.jurke@scott.af.mil with a copy furnished to Susan.Madison@scott.af.mil. Please refer any questions via e-mail to Nancy.jurke@scott.af.mil, phone 618-256-9963 with a copy furnished to Susan.Madison@scott.af.mil, phone 618-256-9965.

<DESC>The U.S. ARMY TACOM-ARDEC intends to award on a full and open competition basis a Multiple Award Task Order Type Contract for Prototype/Production Fabrication in Support of TACOM-ARDEC Ammunitiion and Weapon System Programs. In order that the government receives quality products in a timely manner,  face-to-face contact between the government design engineer(s) and the contractor’s manufacturing/assembly technicians must be encouraged and maintained.  This can be accomplished in a way which is mutually beneficial to the government and the contractor.   To accomplish this objective, the contractor for this proposed contract must be located within a 35-mile radius of Picatinny Arsenal.The objective of the Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide a means by which the TACOM-ARDEC-Producibility for Production Readiness  Competency Division, Prototype Hardware Fabrication Office can award a Task  Order Contract to obtain manufacturing support ( machining, fabrication,assembly, special processes) to produce hardware in support of research and development for ammunition and weapon systems. Items/prototypes to be produced may be “specialty in nature” such as mechanisms, experimental  designs and unique weapon hardware. (NOTE:   This is not a hazardous  item/hazardous material contract.) The contractor will have full responsibility for the particular Task which may include machining, assembly and special processes (coatings/painting). If in- house capability is not available for particular operations the contractor will identify (sub-contractors) out-source operations to complete the requirement. The out-source operations will be at a minimum compared to in-house  capabilities. The contractor will be the Government’s single point of contact for each Task Order. Typical manufacturing lot sizes may be from (but not limited to) 1 to 200 units. Bench test hardware and unique items may require single unit fabrication. The Contractor shall possess an in-house engineering  and design capability for review/revision of drawings to enhance item  producibility. The contractor shall have an in-house quality control/inspection capability to insure the item meets the dimensional and characteristic requirements. Background:  The US Army TACOM-ARDEC, through “life cycle”  responsibility, encompasses a broad range of munition and weapon commodities  used by the United States Armed Forces. In support of various developmental  programs, a “vehicle”, (Task Order Contract), is required to obtain machine shop services to augment the Prototype Hardware Fabrication Facility at ARDEC. Machine shop services include prototype (single unit) manufacturing and  production manufacturing. POC for this action is Cathy Kallistros,  ckallis@pica.army.mil, 973-724-5016.  NOTE 25

<SUBJECT>F--Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge System, Notice of Availability of Federal Assistance: 2004 Request for Challenge Cost Share and Science Camp Proposals.
<DESC>This special notice seeks proposals only under and specific to  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Region 7 (Alaska) based Challenge Cost Share & Science Camp Program.  This is not an announcement any other Region's challenge cost share and science camp program.  This fulfills the public announcement and synopsis requirement for this program in Region 7 (Alaska) only. The Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), National Wildlife Refuge System, administers the Service's Challenge Cost Share program.  Challenge Cost Share (CCS) funds are congressionally appropriated monies designated for the protection and conservation of wildlife resources.  This is a federal matching funds program which leverages federal dollars with non-federal sources.  In addition to money, these federal dollars can be matched with in-kind valuation assigned to non-federal contributions such as labor, equipment use, material and supplies.  The non-federal matches may be contributed by State and local governments, private individuals, private organizations, business enterprises, and charitable groups.  Service policy dictates that no more than 50 percent of the total cost to implement the project may come from federally funded sources.   Explicit funding for the CCS program has been authorized by Congress since 1988.  The Refuge System Administration Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to administer this program.   The CCS program encompasses awards made through both federal assistance and procurement instruments (contracts).  This "call for proposals" is the single designated annual competition through which multiple awards will be made.  A twin posting of this call for proposals # 701814R005 has been posted on http://www.grants.gov and on   http://www.r7.fws.gov/nwr/visitor/grants.htm Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge System Office manages Alaska's Fish and Wildlife Service CCS program.  The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge System invites the submission of new proposals in support of natural resource management and local science camps, both are components of the 2004 CCS program.  This is the initial announcement for these funding opportunities.

POC Contact Eddie Broyles, phone: (843)-218-4423, e-mail: eddie.broyles.navy.mil.  - The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) Charleston is seeking information on all available commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies in the area of intrusion warning systems and devices, to include sensors and ancillary equipment providing such utilities as sensor integration and information display.  SPAWAR is only interested in systems and devices that are currently available to civilian authorities, or scheduled for introduction prior to January 2004.  Technology of use in static exterior and interior systems and deployable/temporary perimeter security and port security applications is of specific interest.  This information will be included in a compendium for use by local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, civil disaster administrators, military disaster control personnel and area disaster/emergency response personnel.  This new compendium will update and expand the Perimeter Security Sensor Technologies Handbook, published by NISE East in 1997, available for review at http://www.justnet.org/perimetr/start.htm.  Not all information provided will necessarily be included in this compendium.  Determination as to its suitability will be made by SPAWAR based on the objectives of this request. The purpose of this compendium is to provide users a ready reference of available technology with sufficient insight into the capabilities and limitations of the various systems and devices to enable them to select those which best meet their needs.  This compendium will be an unclassified document disseminated to federal, state and local agencies.  All information received will be treated as public knowledge; therefore, vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this Request for Information (RFI.) Specific information sought includes: (1) a description of the system or device -- size, weight, operating principals and parameters to include limitations and number of personnel required to operate the system -- and its designated and potential applications; (2) cost, to include purchase price and expected operation and maintenance costs; (3) the system's or device's compatibility with other intrusion warning technologies; (4) a listing of current users or, in the case of technologies that have not yet been introduced into the market, organizations that have placed orders for the system or technology; (5) installation and support specifications and requirements; and (6) the name and phone number/e-mail address of the individual that the users should contact for more information on the system or device.  Diagrams, drawings and photographs that would assist the user in understanding the system or device are requested.   This announcement is for information gathering purposes. Submittals: Respondents are welcome to provide information in the form of product brochures, press releases, technical specification sheets, independent assessment results, reprints of trade journal articles, etc, although electronic media are preferred (CD, diskette, or internet link).

<DESC>R--Implementing Initial NOAA-wide Economics and Social Science Research Program. U.S. Dept. of Commerce/NOAA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Irving Leveson using simplified acquisition procedures for consulting services to develop the initial NOAA-wide Economics and Social Science Research Program.  

Dr. Leveson's specific past experience consist of working with NOAA on applications of social science concepts and tools to decision-making and management, notably in the areas of business and economic trends and evolving business models in the private and public sector such as the provision of weather and climate forecasts and information, evolutionary technology such as the internet, WEB services, and electronic commerce; research and develop trends and public/private sector interfaces, including climate and satellites, and environmental and natural resource management issues. Dr. Leveson has developed a wide-ranging familiarity with NOAA mandates, programs, organization and directions. He was Principal Investigator of the September 2002 trend analysis that contributed to the development of NOAA's strategic plan and provided focused assistance on special issues such as technology and ocean issues.  Dr. Leveson has directed and executed similar program and research planning contracts in Government and the Private sector.
 
The March 18, 2003 report: Social Science Research Within NOAA: Review and Recommendations, the Social Science Review Panel, reporting to the NOAA Social Science Advisory Board recommended that NOAA improve social science literacy and develop action plans and programs to utilize social science more fully and effectively throughout NOAA.  As identified in Program Guidance memoranda, to immediately implement this program. The effort will be carried out under the Office of the Chief Economist and will include approximately 10-12 workshops with NOAA Assistant Administrators, workshops with the mission goal teams, workshops with program managers in the NOAA line offices, and guidance to the mission goal teams and the offices of Program Planning and Integration (PPI) and Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) on utilizing social science in new NOAA Program Planning and Budgeting Process.

The larger near term effort in NOAA, of which this is an integral part, includes additional components of working with line offices on planning, substantive development, and initiation of small-scale focused projects in FY 04, developing the FY 05 work program on applying social science, and devising and preparing strategic and guidance documents for a 5-year research plan across NOAA for work beginning in FY 06. 

The contractor will be responsible for developing the substance of the workshops for the AA, mission goal team and line office program managers, which will illuminate the uses and benefits of a wide range of social sciences, especially economics, including cost benefit analysis, environmental valuation, risk analysis, and value of information techniques.  Contractor will help identify and work with the speakers on content and presentation, including the mix of theoretical and applied material, participate substantively in the sessions, develop the background and presentation materials, prepare substantive notes on the discussions outlining options for future directions, and assist with developing a social science component in each mission goal team's Program Plan. The discussions will include previous applications of social science in NOAA, planned and potential uses, and uses in similar contexts, along with critical concepts and measures. NOAA social science staff will assist in this effort as required and available. 

The objective of the effort is to help prepare NOAA for the 21st century by developing a broad social science and economics program within the context of major 5-10 year trends facing NOAA such as science, technology and communication; globalization; climate change; demands for services and cooperation; economic and business trends; environmental and resource management trends and policies; and government initiatives.  Contractor will be required to integrate key social science concepts to non-specialist senior management within the context of these broad trends affecting NOAA's programs and policies.  As such it is critical that a though and complete set of analytical skills in the field of economics, as well as mathematics and statistics, and demographics be applied to achieve the required objectives.

Deliverables

The deliverables are:

(4) AA workshops for Assistant Administrators and other senior NOAA personnel, of 1-1/2 to 2 hours each.

(4) workshops for mission goal teams and their staffs of up to ½ day each.

Approximately 4 workshops for selected program managers in line offices of 3-4 hours each.
