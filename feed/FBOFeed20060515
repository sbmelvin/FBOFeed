<DESC>Preparedness for public health threats is a major goal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). An influenza pandemic has a great potential to cause large numbers of deaths and illnesses over a short time period. A pandemic occurs when there is an antigenic shift in influenza A virus and transmission of a new strain to which most or all of the world's population is susceptible. Three pandemics occurred during the 20th century, the most severe of which, in 1918, caused over 500,000 U.S. deaths and more than 20 million deaths worldwide. Within the scientific community, it is generally believed that the occurrence of another influenza pandemic is most likely. Recent outbreaks of human disease caused by avian H5, H9, and H7 influenza strains in Asia, Europe, and North America highlight the potential of new strains to be introduced into the population. Estimates for the next pandemic, extrapolating from those of the 20th century, range from about 100,000 to over 2 million deaths in the U.S. alone.  

	Influenza antiviral drugs and influenza vaccines are considered a primary means to decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with the next pandemic. HHS is pursuing multiple and parallel strategies to close the gap between current antiviral drug and influenza vaccine supply and the HHS goal of stockpiling licensed and new antiviral drugs and pre-pandemic vaccines as part of the strategic plan for pandemic preparedness. 

The Department of Health and Human Services through the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Office of Research and Development Coordination contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to support advanced stage development of new antiviral compounds for the treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic and seasonal influenza leading toward submission of a U.S. licensure application and development of required industrial capacity to support implementation of the influenza antivirals at full production capacity at or before the onset of a pandemic.  HHS is particularly interested in the advanced development of new influenza antiviral agents designed to affect different targets of influenza virus infection or to enhance effects of present classes of influenza antiviral drugs, formulated for long term stability, long bioavailability, and simple dosing regimens. Incremental multi-year funding for cost-reimbursement contracts to biopharmaceutical companies will be provided to support this effort.  Ultimately, these influenza antivirals shall be produced at one or more Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed manufacturing facilities and shall provide sufficient surge capacity to contribute substantially to U.S. and ideally global antivirals needs during an influenza pandemic.  The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of up to five years. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.  RFP-DHHS-ORDC-VB-06-01 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about May 31, 2006 with proposals being due on or about July 18, 2006.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this internet site for the release of this solicitation as well as any amendments.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website.  No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-VB-06-01, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice.   Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award in Fall 2006.

More than one white paper may be submitted during the twelve (12) month period following publication of this announcement. Upon submission, the white paper will be forwarded on for technical review. The Government will respond to the offerors as to whether the white paper will be further considered for submission within 60 days from receipt. If the proposed capability meets program requirements, the Government will officially request a full proposal. When a request for proposal is issued, it will detail the necessary information. Request for a full proposal does not guarantee award. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the white papers received in response to this announcement. FULL PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION – Proposals may address one or more of the areas listed above. Proposals shall be limited to advanced development where concept feasibility has already been demonstrated. The period of performance may range from a level of effort of .5 to 5 work-years depending on acquisition vehicle awarded. Reasonable deviations/exceptions will be considered. More than one proposal may be submitted during the twelve (12) month period following publication of this announcement. Offerors shall complete the on-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) before submission of a proposal. The information pertaining to ORCA can be found on the website http://www.bpn.gov/orca. Offerors shall be current on the Central Contractor registration, the website can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/vendor.asp. Proposals shall not exceed ten pages (10) pages. Offerors are advised to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.7 with proposals. Offerors shall review technical data rights clauses found under FAR 27 and DFARS 227, and technical data restrictions and associated clauses shall be proposed up front. Cost proposals shall include a detailed breakdown of proposed cost/prices, and shall remain valid for a period of 120 days. Offerors shall submit one (1) original and four (2) copies of their proposal to Contracts, Attn: Roberta Nethercutt, Department Of The Navy, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, Aircraft Support Contracts Department (2.5.1.3.2.6), 21983 Bundy Road, Unit 7 Bldg 441, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127. The cost of preparation and response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to the resulting contract or any other contract. PROPOSAL EVALUATION – Proposals will be evaluated as they are received. Merit shall be determined based on: (1) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) the offerors ability to demonstrate feasibility (3) the offerors experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these criteria which are integral for achieving the proposed objectives, and (4) realism of proposed cost. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR PART 35.007 and Subpart 15. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE - NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional contracts using FAR/DFARS and/or non-procurement agreements e.g. Cooperative Agreements under 10 U.S.C. 2358 and Technology Incentive Awards under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or U.S.C. 2358 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Acquisition type (contract/agreement) is ultimately determined by the Government. NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract/agreement modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements, thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract/agreement, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act. AWARDS - Contract award will be based on the proposal s technical merit, cost, and availability of appropriations. The Government intends to award within 120 days from receipt of full proposal. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror prior to award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIS. Offerors are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government. POINTS OF CONTACT - The technical point of contact is Dr. James Sheehy, AIR 4.6T (301) 342-8480, e-mail: mailto:James.Sheehy@navy.mil, while Ms. Roberta Nethercutt (301) 757-8939, email: mailto:roberta.nethercutt@navy.mil is the point of contact for all contractual matters.

<DESC>CMS intends to award a 26-month cost reimbursement contract, with two options periods, to one or more small business(s) to assist CMS in performing data processing and medical reviews for the Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) projects.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Potential offerors are hereby advised that their accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and that FAR Clause 52.219-14 and that Limitations of Subcontracting will be incorporated into the solicitation and resultant contract.  

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541513.  This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  

BACKGROUND: CMS must estimate payment error rates in Medicaid and SCHIP as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002 (Public Law 107-300).  The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the amount of improper payments, and report those estimates to Congress on an annual basis.  The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.

CMS will use a contracting strategy to implement the Medicaid and SCHIP PERM program, which includes reviewing fee-for-service claims and managed care capitation payments.  This strategy will engage multiple contractors including a statistical contractor (being procured in a separate procurement), and

(A) A Medicaid documentation/database contractor (DDC), and 
(B) A SCHIP DDC, 
(C) A Medicaid review contractor (RC), and
(D) A SCHIP RC

The solicitation may allow Offeror(s) to bid on this work in the following four areas (1) Medicaid DDC; (2) SCHIP DDC; (3) Medicaid RC or (4) SCHIP RC or any combination of the four.

The statistical contractor will perform all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions for the Medicaid and SCHIP Programs.  The DDC will gather and maintain medical policies and corresponding quarterly updates from states, and will collect and maintain medical records from providers.  The RC will gather and maintain the data processing manuals, will use the collected policies and medical records to perform medical and data processing reviews; put into place a difference resolution process for the state to dispute the contractor’s findings; provide its findings to the statistical contractor; jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor; and submit the report to CMS.  

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS: The successful documentation/database contract offeror(s) shall coordinate, collect, and maintain all state Medicaid and/or SCHIP policies and/or manuals necessary to conduct medical reviews.  This process will also include the collection, on a quarterly basis, and maintenance of all state policy updates related to medical or payment policy.  The policies and corresponding updates will appear in a variety of formats (e.g., via website, electronic PDF format, and hardcopy).  The offeror shall have the knowledge and means to manipulate the policy formats for uniformity and relative ease of use by the reviewers.  The offeror(s) shall maintain all state Medicaid and/or SCHIP policies in a central housing unit that will be accessed by the reviewers when conducting medical reviews and data processing reviews.  

The successful documentation/database contract offeror(s) shall also coordinate, request, obtain, scan and upload medical records for the sampled claims.  This process will include contacting the providers, and requesting and receiving the medical records associated with the sampled claims.  The offeror shall maintain all medical records in a central housing unit that will be accessed by the reviewers when conducting medical reviews.  

The offeror shall be advised that the size and length of each policy will vary.  The offeror shall be prepared to coordinate efforts to obtain policies and quarterly updates of the policies for 17 Medicaid states and/or 17 SCHIP states.  The offeror shall also be prepared to handle approximately 800 – 1200 sampled fee-for-service claims and medical records, or an average of 1000 sampled claims and medical records, for each state. The sampling unit is defined as an individually priced service (e.g., a physician office visit or a hospital stay).  The sampling unit may be a claim or line item. 

The successful review contract offeror(s) shall make a payment determination for each sampling unit by performing data processing reviews and medical reviews.  The offeror shall review each sampling unit to determine if it was processed through the claims payment system correctly, medically necessary, coded correctly and properly paid or denied.  The offeror shall validate whether each sampling unit was paid correctly based on: information found on the claim, the information in the medical record, the information in the claims processing system, and state policies.  

For the managed care initiative, the review contract offeror shall conduct a data processing review of approximately 500 managed care capitation payments for each of the 17 states. The offeror will provide its review findings to the states and the statistical contractor; maintain a difference resolution process; jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor; and submit the report to CMS.  

The offeror(s) shall perform this work for one complete production cycle, which is a 26-month period. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal in late May 2006/early June 2006 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Hence, we request you to add our name to your bidder's list and do inform us about upcoming Projects, Tenders. Will there be a published list of interested or approved vendors? A: As the Governmentwide point of entry is Fedbizopps, we no longer have insight as to all parties interested in obtaining RFPs.

Parties interested in other NAWCWD procurements can sign up for notification of procurement information within Fedbizopps at the web link http://www1.fbo.gov/EPSVendorRegistration.html. Q: Before the RFP is released, are there any key individuals that I could contact to arrange a capability briefing?  Will there be an Industry Day? A: No, at this stage of this procurement process neither pre-solicitation briefings or an industry day will be held.   Q: Is there a technical or program point of contact?  I would really appreciate a name and telephone number or e-mail address.

Q: Are you aware of any other companies or teams that have expressed interest in this procurement action?

Do you desire your contractor's facility to be at or near China Lake?  A: It is not anticipated that there will be a full-time on-site presence required, however the Contractor may require access to intelligence data, including the SIPRNET at the government activity.

A: At this time the known minimum quantity is $50,000 and the anticipated maximum quantity is 75,700 hours, however the estimated number of task orders to be awarded per year is not known.

THE CAPABILITY STATEMENTS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 3 PAGES AND PROVIDE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE VENDOR'S ORGANIZATION (BIO); TEAMING AGREEMENTS; RESOURCE AND TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND RISK; AND SUGGESTIONS.  CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM POTENTIAL 8(a) MENTOR-PROTÉGÉ JOINT VENTURES AND TEAMING PARTNERSHIPS ARE ENCOURAGED.  The Office of Acquisition (AQM) in the Department of State seeks to issue an 8(a) competitive procurement on behalf of the Bureau of Resource Management, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Financial Services (RM/GFS) to assist the Department in its effort to provide financial services in support of overseas and domestic operations at the Global Financial Services (GFS) in Charleston, SC.  These services include Disbursing, Accounting, Payroll, Payments, and operations in support of these activities, including services related to the operation and maintenance of local area networks, maintenance of installed systems supporting automated financial systems and systems analysis, user support and training related to installed automated financial systems, and other related services.  These activities currently employ approximately 300 full time personnel.  Labor categories will include program management, financial, information technology, and administrative services.  The Department desires to award a single contract for this support to GFS Charleston.  The contract will primarily focus on the GFS Charleston, but support services will be needed by other RM Bureau organizations.  Therefore, the Washington DC metropolitan area will be a secondary place of performance, with a projected 5% of the total contract requirement designated for Washington area RM Bureau usage.  Therefore the vendor must have or establish a facility in the Charleston Metro area.  There will be a need for contractor personnel to travel between Charleston, SC and the Washington DC metro area (DC, MD, VA), as well as some overseas travel.  The Department seeks from 8(a) vendors capability statements outlining how they are able to meet the Department's need for this support services requirement.   This Request for Information (Sources Sought) offers the opportunity for 8(a) vendors to present a capability statement and teaming agreement to shows their qualification on meeting RM's needs for support services.  Currently the Department intends to offer this opportunity to all 8(a) vendors capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.  Vendors should indicate their General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract number, if applicable. Indicate size (e.g. number of client sites, related contract(s) or project(s), dollar value of each contract or project, scope), and teaming agreements. (3 pages) Capability statements from potential 8(a) Mentor-Protégé joint ventures and teaming partnerships are encouraged.  Review of vendor responses and information exchange meeting(s): The Government will review submissions to ascertain the relevance to the RM environment and goals.  Subsequent to review of vendor responses to the RFI, the Department may at its discretion hold technical information exchange meeting(s) with respondents. The meeting(s) will focus on industry experiences related to development, technical solutions, best practices and lessons learned, risks and programmatic benefits.  Also, potential bidders may be asked to travel to Charleston for a capability briefing.  Disclaimer: This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and can not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

5. MARKET VALUE:		The position is the equivalent of a 
				GS-14, with salary ranging from 	
				$77,793 to $101,130 per annum. Final

				history, experience and educational 
				background.
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years from effective date of contract.
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	Tirana, Albania 
8. SUPERVISION:		USAID/Mission Director. 
9. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 	As below

Background:

USAID/Albania manages development and transition programs in Albania, financed through Support for East European Democracy (SEED) funds.  Total SEED assistance for Albania is about $25 million annually, of which USAID/Albania manages roughly $19 million.  In addition to the Director, the Mission is staffed with five US Direct Hires (USDHs), four US Personal Services Contractors (USPSCs) (plus three intermittent USPSC advisors), and 25 Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs).  The USAID/Albania Strategic Plan is organized around a Results Framework containing five strategic objectives (SOs), which link with USAID E&E Bureau goals for: economic restructuring (SO 1.3); civil society development and local government and decentralization (SO 2.1); rule of law (SO 2.2); primary health care reform (SO 3.2); and special initiatives, including energy and combatting trafficking in persons (SO 4.1).

The US Government has a strong interest in reducing corruption in Albania.  Expanded emphasis is being given to rule of law, democracy and governance, and the fight against trafficking in persons.  Largely because of perceptions of corruption in the country, Albania did not qualify as a candidate country for the U.S. Government’s Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), which is administered by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).  However, Albania did qualify as a candidate for the Threshold Program, which is intended to assist governments in addressing shortfalls in their qualification for the MCA.  The Government of Albania (GoA) submitted a Threshold Program proposal that was subsequently accepted and funded.  The USPSC incumbent of this position will manage the MCA Threshold Program in Albania.

Basic Function of the Position: 

The Development Assistance Specialist (MCA) will be responsible for oversight of ongoing and planned activities related to USAID/Albania management of the MCA Threshold Program, in accordance with an interagency agreement with the MCC.  Mangement of Albania’s Threshold Country Plan will consist of program direction, management, implementation support, monitoring, coordination, and reporting associated with all activities funded by the Millennium Challenge Account.  The primary emphasis will be on three two-year activities totalling $13.85 million, aimed at reducing corruption and increasing efficiency in the Government’s tax administration, public procurement, and business registration sectors.
USAID/Albania has recently added a Millennium Challenge Support Objective to its current strategy, in order to cover the Threshold Program.  The Development Assistance Specialist (MCA) serves as an active member of the Mission Millennium Challenge Support Objective Team that includes Mission staff, grantees, contractors, host-government officials, and other partners, to ensure maximum program impact with available resources.

Major Duties and Responsibilities:

Specifically, the responsibilities of the Development Assistance Specialist (MCA) shall include, but not be limited to: program conceptualization and activity design; basic oversight and management of assigned current and planned activities that support the MCA Threshold Program; providing recommendations to the Mission and others concerning design and implementation of strategies, plans, and budgets for ongoing and planned activities; serving as a key Mission resource for information and knowledge about the MCA Threshold Program; management and preparation of input on the MCA Threshold Program portfolio for the annual Congressional Budget Justification process and the SEED report; coordination of all MCA Threshold Program activities, including grantee and contractor work plans, with other members of the Strategic Objective Team; preparation and dissemination of reports on the impact and results of MCA Threshold Program activities; ensuring that all administrative and accountability requirements related to USAID/Albania’s MCA Threshold Program are handled in accordance with established policies and procedures; drafting, or supervising the drafting of, resources transfer documentation (e.g., Modified Acquisition and Assistance Request Documents [MAARDs]), and obtaining necessary approvals; and, ensuring performance-monitoring systems are in place, including the Performance Monitoring Plan (PMP), that reliable indicators of portfolio impact are established for assigned area of responsibility, periodically reviewing progress in achieving outputs and results, and recommending corrective steps in identified problem areas.  Because of the precedent-setting nature of the MCA Threshold Program, the Development Assistance Specialist (MCA) will have unusual responsibilities for developing policies, strategies, plans, and procedures for MCA programs and implementing partners.

The Development Assistance Specialist (MCA) will liaise with other donors, and develop procedures to assure cooperation and complementarity in MCA Threshold Program-related activities; maintain day-to-day contact with resident grantees and contractors in related fields, and with short-term advisors and specialists regarding their activities; conduct site visits and inspections; maintain up-to-date information on developments in all areas of the MCA Threshold Program sector; keep the Mission and other relevant offices and organizations informed of problems that could impede results achievement; and, ensure that partners receive needed information on USAID regulations and policies, including audit regulations, and are informed of country-level and regional issues.  The Development Assistance Specialist (MCA) will assure close coordination of MCA-funded activities with other USAID-managed programs, as well as those of the US Embassy, other donors, and, to the extent required, within the Albanian Government.

The Development Assistance Specialist (MCA) will carry out or manage program evaluations and assessments, as needed, with follow-up to recommended actions; and will manage closeout actions for completed activities in the MCA Threshold Program portfolio.

The Development Assistance Specialist (MCA) will supervise a small FSN staff, assigned to assist with oversight and implementation of the USAID/Albania MCA Threshold Country Plan.

Performs other duties as assigned or required.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY (SOURCES SOUGHT) AND NOT A SOLICITATION. THE RFI IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM 8(a) VENDORS OUTLINING HOW THEY CAN SATISFY THE GOVERNMENTS NEEDS FOR AN 8(a) COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION.  THE CAPABILITY STATEMENTS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 3 PAGES AND PROVIDE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE VENDOR'S ORGANIZATION (BIO); TEAMING AGREEMENTS; RESOURCE AND TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND RISK; AND SUGGESTIONS.  CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM POTENTIAL 8(a) MENTOR-PROTÉGÉ JOINT VENTURES AND TEAMING PARTNERSHIPS ARE ENCOURAGED.  The Office of Acquisition (AQM) in the Department of State seeks to issue an 8(a) competitive procurement on behalf of the Bureau of Resource Management, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Financial Services (RM/GFS) to assist the Department in its effort to provide financial services in support of overseas and domestic operations at the Global Financial Services (GFS) in Charleston, SC.  These services include Disbursing, Accounting, Payroll, Payments, and operations in support of these activities, including services related to the operation and maintenance of local area networks, maintenance of installed systems supporting automated financial systems and systems analysis, user support and training related to installed automated financial systems, and other related services.  These activities currently employ approximately 300 full time personnel.  Labor categories will include program management, financial, information technology, and administrative services.  The Department desires to award a single contract for this support to GFS Charleston.  The contract will primarily focus on the GFS Charleston, but support services will be needed by other RM Bureau organizations.  Therefore, the Washington DC metropolitan area will be a secondary place of performance, with a projected 5% of the total contract requirement designated for Washington area RM Bureau usage.  Therefore the vendor must have or establish a facility in the Charleston Metro area.  There will be a need for contractor personnel to travel between Charleston, SC and the Washington DC metro area (DC, MD, VA), as well as some overseas travel.  The Department seeks from 8(a) vendors capability statements outlining how they are able to meet the Department's need for this support services requirement.   This Request for Information (Sources Sought) offers the opportunity for 8(a) vendors to present a capability statement and teaming agreement to shows their qualification on meeting RM's needs for support services.  Currently the Department intends to offer this opportunity to all 8(a) vendors capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.  Vendors should indicate their General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract number, if applicable. Indicate size (e.g. number of client sites, related contract(s) or project(s), dollar value of each contract or project, scope), and teaming agreements. (3 pages) Capability statements from potential 8(a) Mentor-Protégé joint ventures and teaming partnerships are encouraged.  Review of vendor responses and information exchange meeting(s): The Government will review submissions to ascertain the relevance to the RM environment and goals.  Subsequent to review of vendor responses to the RFI, the Department may at its discretion hold technical information exchange meeting(s) with respondents. The meeting(s) will focus on industry experiences related to development, technical solutions, best practices and lessons learned, risks and programmatic benefits.  Also, potential bidders may be asked to travel to Charleston for a capability briefing.  Disclaimer: This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and can not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Department makes no implied or in fact contract by issuing and publishing this market survey. Vendor submission of responses and contact information: Electronic responses to this Request for Information are required. Please submit responses via email in Microsoft Word or Adobe pdf format no later than 4:00 pm EST on Thursday, September 12, 2005, to: BaraneEJ@state.gov.

<SUBJECT>10 -- Wide Area Search Synthetic Aperture Radar (WASSAR) - PART 1 OF 2
<DESC>(PART 1 OF 2)
A -- INTRODUCTION: 
The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Advanced Guidance Division (AFRL/MNGS) is interested in receiving white papers for development and demonstration of the Wide-Area Search Synthetic Aperture Radar (WASSAR) seeker 6.3 program, under this Special Amendment to the Armament Technology Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) MNK-BAA-06-0001.  The objective of the program is to perform trade studies, design, develop, test and demonstrate a tactical brassboard seeker capable of autonomously searching, acquiring, tracking, classifying, and engaging ground mobile (moving and stationary) targets in adverse weather that may have a large location uncertainty.

White paper submittals should reference “MNK-BAA-06-0001C”.  Where the instructions in MNK-BAA-06-0001 differ from the instructions in this Special Amendment, this document prevails.  White papers should not exceed 30 letter-size pages, using either Arial or Times New Roman font, with not less than 12-point type size, and should be submitted no later than 1:30 PM Central Time to AFRL/MNK on 20 June  2006.  White papers should include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost for the WASSAR 6.3 Program, broken down by Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) (see Section B(2) below).  It is anticipated that up to one of the white papers may be selected for further consideration, and its originator may subsequently be requested to submit formal written technical and cost proposals, with the intent of negotiating one contract for the WASSAR Program.  Should award to an offeror selected to submit a proposal prove to not be in the government’s best interest (e.g., technical or cost issues), the government reserves the right to request a proposal from another white paper submitter.  Seven hard copies and one electronic copy (on a CD or DVD) of the white paper should be submitted to the AFRL/MNK Contracting Office to the parties shown in Section F – Points of Contact, paragraph (1).  Email submissions will not be accepted.  A confirmation of receipt will be emailed as white papers are received, assuming an email address is provided with the white paper.  All submittals received will be reviewed and evaluated using the Evaluation Criteria found in Section E - Basis for Award.  Offerors should be alert to any amendments that may be published.  The Government reserves the right to amend due dates or other data as necessary, and to make awards without discussions.  The Government will not assume that an offeror possesses any capability unless specifically addressed in the white paper.  Alternate white papers will not be accepted for this acquisition.    

B-- REQUIREMENTS:  

(1)  Program Background:  Present-day Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors are capable of producing high-resolution imagery in adverse weather conditions, and are used heavily in surveillance and reconnaissance.   Current radar hardware and supporting electronics can be compactly packaged making them attractive for use in munitions seeker applications.  These sensors can be configured to operate in a SAR and a Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) mode, which enables the same sensor to be used for detecting ground mobile (moving and stationary) targets.  While SAR can be developed for classifying non-moving mobile targets, other techniques such as High Range Resolution (HRR) have demonstrated capability for moving target classification.  

The future evolution of multimode radar seekers is for weapons that require seekers six inches or less in diameter, and capable of engaging mobile targets with large location uncertainty in adverse weather (e.g.:  rain, fog, airborne sand, snow).  These new capabilities require high resolution as well as innovative signal processing techniques, to complete wide area search, acquire, track, classify and engagement roles.  Future seekers are anticipated to use commercially available components and mature algorithms which will reduce cost and improve performance relative to current munition seeker systems.  

This program intends to concentrate on wide area search, direct attack missions, characteristic of long-range, high subsonic-speed, high altitude munitions.  Under this effort, the proposed solutions will have to meet minimum system requirements and applicable parameters.  These system requirements and applicable parameters are available to all qualified contractors.  See Section C(5) below.

<SUBJECT>Z -- IDAS MAINTENANCE
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Procurement and Grants Office intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Johnson Controls, Inc. for services and materials to maintain the IDAS system at the CDC’s Roybal, Chamblee, and Lawrenceville Campuses and at the CDC’s Executive Park, Century Center, Koger, Decatur, and Chamblee Warehouse leased facilities. The Intrusion Detection and Assessment System (IDAS) is a CDC mission critical integrated system comprised of an existing closed circuit television system (CCTV), digital video recorder system (DVRS) with integral video motion detection (VMD) systems, and an existing Johnson Controls Pegasys 2000 access control system (CARDKEY).  The IDAS functions to organize and present video, text, and event information to security operators in an effort to assist them in assessing and dispositioning potential threats to CDC facilities and personnel.  JCI’s Pegasys 2000 (P2000) Access Control System is a proprietary access control system utilized to control and record access to sensitive areas.  It provides alarm functions for access abnormalities.  It serves as the primary logic engine and operator interface for the IDAS.  JCI is the only qualified company that can provide these services and materials to maintain the IDAS system. However because this is dealing with proprietary security systems and equipment it is in the best interest of the government to award to Johnson Controls Inc. This is not a request for competitive proposals, however interested parties may submit in writing within 14 days of this publication if interested. The authority for this non-competitive award is FAR 6.302-6- National Security, Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(6) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(6) and FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) Responses may be emailed to Contract Specialist, Teresa Harris at tuh2@cdc.gov. The value of this acquisition is below the simplified acquisition threshold.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The following clause applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text:

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
Number Note 1 applies.

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  Line Item 0001: The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, High Resolution Neutron Imaging Detector.

The High Resolution Neutron Imaging Detector shall meet or exceed the following specifications:

1. Detector technology must have neutron imaging spatial resolution of at least 0.020 mm.  This resolution must have been publicly demonstrated by measuring the edge spread of a neutron absorber such as Cadmium or Gadolinium using a thermal neutron beam.  Spatial resolution is defined as the variance determined from an error function fit to the measured edge spread.  Public demonstration includes either publication in a peer reviewed journal, or image data and experimental details that can be shared with and evaluated by the NIST technical contact.
2. The detector will have a global count rate that is at least 3 MHz.
3. The detector's field of view will be at least 25 mm in diameter, with the capability of scaling up to a field of view of 30mm x 30mm or higher.  
4. The detector pixel pitch will be less than 0.010 mm.
5. The neutron sensitive portion of the detector will be able to be separated from the readout electronics (such as ancillary signal processing equipment such as NIM modules and/or a computer) with cables up to 10 meters in length.  This separation is required to keep the electronics out of a high radiation area. 
6. The detector should be able to handle neutron exposure for up to 1000 hours with only a gradual reduction in performance that can be software corrected.  The vendor must be technically capable and willing to refurbish the detector to bring back its performance to the original (or nearly original) condition after 1000 hours of operation, if desired by NIST.  The vendor may want to specify the possible standard refurbishment fee (if exists) as a separate item (independent of the procurement cost) in the quotation.   
7. The closest approach to the front face of the neutron sensitive element of the detector will be no more than 1 cm (see figure - attached as a supporting document).  The detector housing will be less than 20.5 cm (8 inches) in diameter, and less than 5 cm (2 inches) in width.  The detector housing will have threaded holes for 1/4-20 bolts along the circumference for mounting.
8. Image acquisition must be computer controlled.  Control includes setting an arbitrary image acquisition time, setting the pixel pitch and initiating image acquisition through either ActiveX controls, macro scripts, or other appropriate means.  The image acquisition software will be able to save images in either the FITS or TIF file formats as 16-bit integers.  The image acquisition software will run natively in Windows XP.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible contractors may submit a quotation.

All interested quoters shall provide a quotation for a high-end autocollimator.

LINE ITEM 0001:  Quantity of (1) each Autocollimator which shall meet or exceed the following required specifications:

a) two measurement axes – horizontal and vertical (x and y)

b) angular resolution:  0.05 arc second or better in both axes

c) angular measurement range:  0.5 degrees or more

d) PC interface:  RS 232 or IEEE-488 (GPIB)

e) data export:  text or ASCII format

The Surface and Microform Metrology Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a need for accurately monitoring the microscope head tilting angle of an interference microscope in respect to the sample position.  Knowing this angle accurately will enable an accurate evaluation of the parameters of the microscope, and that will lead to better performance of the microscope.  Similarly, the performance of a scanning stage in a calibrated atomic force microscope (C-AFM) must be checked during its scanning.  One of the performance criteria is to monitor its motion during scanning.  A perfect motion is the stage moving without any pitch, yaw, or roll motion.  A good quality autocollimator can measure these angles accurately to 0.0001 degree.

The Contractor shall state the warranty coverage provided for the instrument.

Delivery shall be completed not later than 60 days after receipt of an order and shall be FOB Destination.  FOB Destination means:  The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD  20899-0001

Award will be made to the quoter whose quotation offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria:  1) technical capability factor meeting or exceeding the requirement; 2) past performance; and, 3) price.

Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are equal in importance to price.  If technical capability and past performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.

Past performance and price will not be evaluated on quotations that are determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the technical capability evaluation factor.

Evaluation of technical capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quoters shall include product literature which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated herein.

Past performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided and the Contractor’s history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables.  Evaluation of past performance will be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or the offeror’s recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates.  Offerors shall provide at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum:  the name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer, if applicable; and, the date of delivery or the date services were completed.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO) is to conduct a subsurface investigation at Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 542 and has tasked Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture (SNJV) to execute the work for the project.  SNJV is soliciting to procure drilling services at the Nevada Test Site, Area 3.  The scope of this investigation requires drilling and backfilling a minimum of five boreholes to depths ranging from approximately 100 feet (ft) up to 420 ft below ground surface (bgs) to collect subsurface soil samples.  Some of the deeper borings may require the installation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) casing to control borehole sloughing.  The planned total footage is approximately 964 ft and the expected period of performance is 65 days.  Depending on field conditions, revisions to the scope of work as defined in this document (i.e., advancement of additional boreholes or deeper boreholes for a potential total of 1,434 ft) may occur.  The actual footage and period of performance are dependent on conditions in the field and the analytical results from soil samples.  

The SNJV anticipates a Time and Materials Construction contract with a performance period of April 12, 2006 ending August 18, 2006.  The solicitation/RFP will be issued electronically. The solicitation number is SN06R0088.  Solicitation package may be downloaded from the SNJV web site at http://www.Stoller-Navarro.com.

The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/KSC Business Opportunities home page is    http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76	 Questions and Answers (11 questions) 1.  In the solicitation (Form 1339 Item 3 is Camera Station Controller and it refers us to Paragraph 3.6 of the SOW.  No where on this form is there a line item for the the Camera Control Interface (CCI) - section 3.5 of the SOW.  Are these to be included in Item 3? Answer: The number of CCI’s is what ever is necessary to meet the overall requirement of the system.  That is why it is not mentioned like the Camera Station Controller. 2.  Will KSC provide / recommend / require approval of the network switched that are used for the interconnection of the Ethernet based equipment? Answer: No. 3.  Section 3.20 - It is unclear if NASA will be providing the pressure transducer or if it is to be vendor supplied. Answer: The optional pressure sensor should be vendor supplied. 4.  Section 2.6 (b) - Will the Vicon cameras be connected to the Sony router or will control of the GVG router still be requried? Answer: Control of the Grass Valley Analog router is not a requirement. 5.  Section 3.2.11  What will the maximum interval between sampling pressure for each camera be? Answer: The interval for sampling of the pressure sensor should be no more than 1 second. 6.  Section 2.8.1.2  Dose NASA want 4 RCP's in each position or 1 RCP with the ability to quickly switch between 4 cameras? Answer: The intention of this requirement is that the form factor should be as small as reasonably practical.  That is why it is a “should” and not a “Shall” type requirement.  If possible we could have 4 RCPs in one console.  Again this is not a Shall and should not be a limiting factor in your design, nor should it increase the cost or decrease the practicallity. (RCP - Remote Control Panel). 7.  Section 3.2.5  Does NASA want these functions, including physical actuators, built into the Maintenance WOrkstation or can they exist in a co-located RCP? Answer: This requirement gives functionality of the Maintenance Work Station.  Implementation of this requirement is up to your design.  Therefore you could utilize a co-located RCP. 8.  Section 3.2.8  Is a simple terminal driven command line interface acceptable for the remote maintenance interface or does NASA wish to use an RCP? Answer: The intent of this requirement is to have a way of communicating and commanding directly to the CCI for troubleshooting of the system. ie. bypassing the head end of the system. 9.  Will NASA provide the vendor with all protocol documents for all hardware to be controlled? Answer: No.  It is the responsibility of the vendor to acquire all non-NASA protocol from the manufacturer directly. 10.  Will NASA provide a vibration table that can be used to test that the board will meet the outlined vibration specifications? Answer: No. It is the responsibility of the vendor to locate and contract vibration test capabilities. 11.  Is there a way to download the following documents: a. 8015-5812-02-00  Vicon Protocol b. 79K31864  Copper Cable specification c. Grass Valley Routing Protocols (no doc #) GVG Protocols  d. 79K31822  Specification for Light Duty Pan Tilt  e. 79K31821 Specification for Heavy Duty Pan Tilt  f.

<DESC>Request for Proposal
Wireless Internet System 
Office of Personnel Management
Federal Executive Institute

Purpose and Scope of Project

This is a new competitive procurement that will result in the award of a single firm, fixed-price contract for installing wireless internet service on the campus of the Federal Executive Institute. The Federal Executive Institute, (FEI), is a federal government facility that provides residential training to federal executives. FEI has elements of government, hospitality industry, and educational institutions in its operations. The installation requires establishing wireless service to cover the entire campus which includes three buildings with eighty two guest bedrooms, 12 classrooms, dining and fitness facilities, and offices for a staff of forty government and contract workers.

REQUIREMENTS

Coverage
Wireless service must provide 100% coverage within all three buildings with the exception of the kitchen food prep and basement storage area of the main building and the maintenance area of Pendleton Hall. Coverage must include all bedrooms, classrooms, lounge areas, office areas an outdoor classroom area located between buildings and an outdoor patio area adjacent to the main building. 
FEI currently subscribes to a high speed DSL service connection in each building through Sprint/EarthLink. It is our intention to have wireless access points extended from these services using a central control and monitoring point in each building to provide coverage and access by technical personnel.
FEI will offer only internet service to it’s customers via wireless and will not be connecting this service to its wired network in any way. 

Security
FEI facilities are located on a fourteen acre campus and wishes to take advantage of its   physical isolation and of signal encryption to protect the security of it’s users as much as is practicable. Wireless access point antennae position and power levels must be adjusted to avoid any signal radiating beyond the perimeter of the property if possible. Access points must support the latest encryption standards to include, but not limited to, WEP, WPA2, and WPA.  Configuration of the access points must be approved by FEI.   Access points must be accessible from a centrally located controller within in each building and be accessible individually via wireless connection using manufacturer supplied utility/configuration software for reprogramming encryption keys and running diagnostic programs. 

System Maintenance
The offeror must include comprehensive maintenance support for one year and a maintenance plan option for out years two, three, and four. The minimum requirement for maintenance support must include two hour business day response by phone, 24 hour response 24X7 by phone, and forty eight hour business day onsite response to perform necessary service to the system. Offerors must demonstrate that they are doing business in, and have qualified service technicians under their direct employ whose duty station is within 50 miles of the FEI campus. No exceptions will be considered for this requirement.  The offeror will also provide 4 health checks and site assessments per calendar year, one each quarter.  This will include, but is not limited to, configuration checks, equipment checks and systems security assessments.


Installation
Offeror must provide all access points, wiring, routers, hubs, power supplies, antennae, smart jacks, and any other hardware or software necessary for a complete turnkey installation. All wiring must be hidden in walls or ceilings. Exceptions for short runs in inconspicuous areas may be approved to reduce cost and complexity of installation. All exposed wiring must be pre approved by the FEI technical representative to meet the requirements of this procurement.
 The successful offeror must be responsible for communication with and coordination of service requirements involving the service provider.  FEI runs classes on a continuous basis and is at full occupancy over ninety percent of the time. Classes often include evenings and weekends.  Offeror must be flexible in scheduling installation which may include some nights and weekends. Classes can not be moved, changed, or rescheduled to accommodate installation.  A schedule of classes and facility availability will be made available to the selected offeror. An FEI representative will be available when installation personnel are on campus.
Offeror must provide relocation of existing LAN wiring in bedrooms and some common areas from the OPM network to the new system to provide both wireless and wired connection to DSL service. Hidden wiring not terminated is not required to be reconnected.  The number of connections to be relocated will not exceed 80 connections in the main building and 20 connections in each of the other two buildings. A separate equipment housing is required in the main building.  Existing connections will be removed from the OPM network. Separate patch panels and other hardware are required as necessary to physically isolate the OPM network from the wireless network.

Hardware and software
Access points must be configured for automatic 802.11 a, b, g trimode support and be capable of a minimum 40mbs pass-through for all clients. Access point hardware must have rogue access point detection fully software upgradeable to AES and 802.11i, have client isolation  capability to prevent client-to-client snooping. Hardware must be designed for configuration with external ceiling mount antennae.  Proxim AP4000 access points are preferred but access points with equivalent or higher capabilities can be used. Consumer units designed for home and small office use are not acceptable.

<DESC>This amendment answers questions submitted to NIST.  Three (3) questions were submitted.  The questions are posted with associated answers after each question.

Question:  #1)		Is the controller required to run both pumps?
Answer:		Yes.  
The controller(s) shall be able to operate both pumps simultaneously. We can have either one controller with two HV outputs or two controllers to control two pumps separately.

Question:  #2)		Are the specifications for the controller correct?  Should it run both pumps....1000 watts power (500 watts each channel)?
Answer:			
The controller(s) (either one or two controllers) should have enough power to operate both pumps simultaneously.
