<DESC>This is the re-posting of FA9401-11-R-0005.
<p>This effort is for a five year contract to include a one year base period and four, one year options.</p>
<p>The Engineering and Technical Support Branch of the Headquarters Air Force Safety Center (HQ AFSC) supports the Integrated Safety Information System (ISIS), which includes Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) and Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) capabilities. MFOQA routinely collects flight data recorder downloads; the data is processed through specialized computer software to uncover mishap precursors, i.e., trends and deviations from standard procedures and parameters, and identify mitigation measures. Analysis of recorded data identifies and quantifies both normal and hazardous flight environments and, where applicable, enables monitoring of control measure effectiveness. The analysis products are available as guidance for operations, training, maintenance, safety, Research &amp; Development, and design decisions.</p>
<p>DoD direction necessitates the sustainment of current MFOQA analysis capabilities, and deployment of MFOQA analyses into other aircraft fleets.</p>
<p>ISIS is a web-based service, currently enabled by a Government Off-the-Shelf open-source software called "Integrated Risk Management System" (IRMS). The government's expectation is that the analysis and reporting capabilities offered through this contract shall, as a minimum, continue to provide the capabilities currently available in ISIS. The proposal may utilize the existing IRMS software, other GOTS or Commercial-Off-the-Shelf software, or a combination. It is the government intent that ISIS remain a web-based service.</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;This announcement is to notify all interested parties that the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (ALC), Robins AFB, GA, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) FA8520-09-R-23939 to procure the TER-9A Triple Ejector Rack, NSN 1095-01-528-5082, P/N 93104917-801A, applicable to the F-16 aircraft. Anticipated solicitation issue date will be 27 June 2010 and anticipated response date will be 27 July 2011. The anticipated contract type is an Indefinite Delivery, modified Requirements instrument with provisions for Firm Fixed Price delivery orders. This is an Insurance Policy buy and will be conducted IAW AFMC Mandatory Procedures.MP 5317.7590-1. Insurance policy procedures provide the means of competing the maximum practical quantity of a requirement while acquiring a Mission Essential Quantity (MEQ) from a proven source to ensure continued mission support during the production capability validation from an unproven source. During the basic 12 month ordering period, if an unproven source is determined to be the best value offeror, a first article requirement of 2 each will be awarded to the unproven source. At the same time, to support the immediate requirement, the proven source will be awarded a contract which during the basic ordering period will include the MEQ with a Best Estimated Quantity (BEQ) of 150 each. There is a basic 12 month MEQ with a BEQ of 150 each plus an MEQ Option I period which may be exercised all at once or in one 6 month and two 3 month periods as follows: (1) a six month MEQ option period I with a BEQ of 75 each, (2) a three month MEQ option period II with a BEQ of 38 each and (3) a three month Production option period with a BEQ of 37 each. The estimate total for these three periods is a BEQ of 150 each. The basic ordering period of one year and six month option period of MEQ Option I should allow adequate time for the successful completion of a qualifying first article from an unproven source. The Basic Ordering Period for the MEQ, the first Outyear Option Period for MEQ options I &amp; II and Production Option quantities, and the Second, Third and Fourth Outyear Option Periods constitute the contract at 150 each per year and will equate to five year program with a total of 750 assets produced. Specifications and drawings will be provided by the Government. Transportation will be F.O.B. destination, and inspection/acceptance will be F.O.B. origin. Shipping destinations will be provided in each individual order. <br />Proposals received in response to the solicitation will be evaluated utilizing a Performance-Price <br />Tradeoff, as described in the RFP.</span></p>

<DESC>NASA/Ames Research Center (ARC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for thelong-lead development of carbon phenolic (CP) Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) for futurerobotic scientific missions.  Mission studies underway at NASA include near term missionsto Venus within this decade to deploy landed experiments, balloons and probes.	Insupport of the decadal survey to assess missions in the next decade, NASA has beenlooking at probes to the Outer Planets including Saturn and Neptune as well as high speedsample return missions from Enceladus.	A Mars Sample Return mission is currently beingconsidered for a mission in the next decade.  All of these missions require a robust heatshield TPS with the size of the entry system ranging from 1 to 3.5 meters in diameter. The TPS community believes that the primary candidate for these missions is theDoD-developed FM 5055 G carbon phenolic that was used for both the Pioneer-Venus (PV) andGalileo entry probes.  The launch time frame for the near term missions (2016 launch) tolong-term missions (2025 launch) also requires that the TPS solutions for both the nearand longer term missions be maintainable.  The intent of this RFP will be to obtain data from industry in order to plan a five yearCP manufacturing and maturation plan that will have opportunities to meet near termmissions and also support the longer term missions with heritage CP (HCP). In addition to exploring heat shields made of HCP using Avtex rayon, there is alsointerest in alternate carbon phenolic composites (alternate sources of carbon cloth) thatwould have performance capability and robustness to meet NASAs future missionrequirements.	 NASAs current goal is to have industry establish a standing capability to provide heatshields for its multiple exploration missions across the next several decades. It is anticipated that NASA/ARC will issue multiple awards from this RFP.A Preliminary Heat Shield Implementation Plan (PHIP) is anticipated to be required fromall offerors as part of their proposal submission.  This information will help NASA tounderstand the current capabilities of each respective offeror to provide all elements ofentry grade carbon phenolic including raw materials, manufacture of test articles,material testing capabilities and full scale manufacturing demonstration units (MDUs).	A Detailed Heat Shield Implementation Plan (DHIP) (a finalized version of the PHIP) willbe a contract deliverable.  It is also anticipated that the resulting contract will include the delivery of testarticles of chop molded carbon phenolic (CMCP) made from a common prepreg that will bemade in accordance to the FM 5055 G specifications using a suitable alternate to Avtexfor the carbonized rayon, phenolic resin and carbon powder filler.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See note26.The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 336419 and 1,000, respectively.The anticipated release date of RFP NNA11392004-AMR is on or about June 27, 2011 with ananticipated quote due date of on or about July 28, 2011.All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B".The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over theInternet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may beaccessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>THIS CONTRACTING ACTION IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.
OBJECTIVE: Removal of soil in the area of a former cattle dip tank at Cokeville Meadows National Wildlife Refuge.   Soil is contaminated with organochlorine pesticides, which are considered hazardous wastes at the concentrations detected in the soil.  
PROJECT LOCATION:
Cokeville Meadows National Wildlife RefugeP.O. Box 189Cokeville, WY  83114
The actual site is approximately 11 miles south of Cokeville, directly off Highway 30.
CURRENT CONDITION:
Cokeville National Wildlife Refuge personnel identified an area where a former cattle dip tank existed.  Personnel from the Environmental Contaminants program with the Ecological Services Office in Cheyenne, Wyoming, collected soil and water samples at the site.  Samples were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides (OCs), organophosphate (OPs) pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  Analytical results of a groundwater sample and three soil samples did not indicate any OPs or PCBs present.  Small levels of two OCs (benzene hexachloride and chlordane) were detected in the groundwater sample but very large concentrations of four OCs (chlordane, lindane, heptachlor epoxide, and toxaphene) were detected in the soil samples.  Such high levels of OCs in the soil are considered as hazardous waste by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.
PROJECT DATA:
The contractor will be required to remove the contaminated soil and dirt from a Government delineated site. The area of the site will be 75 feet by 75 feet, to a depth of 6 feet (approximate level of the ground water). The contaminated soil will be removed to an approved hazardous material disposal site. 
Once the contaminants have been removed, the site is to be restored. Fill materials are available on the refuge and will be available to the contractor. The contractor will be required to re-seed the area with an approved, weed free seed mix (contact the Refuge for the desired seed mix).
GENERAL INFORMATION
The estimated magnitude of construction is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00.  The total performance is 90 days from the Notice to Proceed.  This acquisition is a 100% Small Business Set-aside.  The NAICS code is 562910, Remediation Services, and the size standard is $14 Million.  The solicitation package is anticipated to be available electronically on/or about June 9, 2011 with an anticipated closing date of July 1, 2011.  Copies of the Request for Proposal, specifications and drawings can be obtained at http://www.fedbizopps.gov, or at http://ideasec.nbc.gov, once available for issuance.

<DESC>The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), a program of the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is a national network of 59 affiliated manufacturing extension centers and field offices located throughout all fifty states and Puerto Rico. Created in 1988, the MEP network provides services to small and medium sized manufacturers to increase their global competitiveness. MEP Centers are funded by a combination of Federal, State, local and private resources, and work directly with manufacturing firms in their State or sub-State region. Centers provide expertise, services and assistance directed toward improving top-line growth, supply chain positioning, technology development and deployment, process improvements, workforce development, and the application and implementation of information technology in client companies.
<p>MEP products and services are delivered to small and medium-sized manufacturers by a professional staff of approximately 1,500 MEP Center practitioners who are employed by the independent MEP centers at nearly 400 locations throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Their goal is to help their customers improve by delivering hands-on technical and business assistance. For the purpose of this solicitation, a small and medium sized manufacturing business is defined as having 250 or less employees.</p>
<p>Included in MEP's next generation strategies are continuous improvement, supplier scouting, sustainability, technology acceleration and workforce development. Each of these has a consistent set of current or planned product and service offerings across the system of 59 centers with the exception of workforce development.</p>
<p>NIST MEP is building a strategic talent management tool targeted for small and medium sized manufacturers as this size of manufacturer typically does not have a human resource department or related infrastructure to support a strategic approach to talent. <br /><br />MEP's approach to developing a strategic management tool for small and medium sized manufacturers is to use a life cycle of talent within a firm. This life cycle includes planning and strategic alignment, recruitment, development and management, and retention and succession planning. MEP has titled this manufacturing talent system SMARTalent (strategic management, acquisition, and retention of talent).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall design, develop, test, deploy and provide documentation, training, and technical assistance for the recruitment module of the SMartTalent tool.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541511 with a small business size standard of $25.0 million. Contracting by Negotiation shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 15. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business. A firm fixed price contract is anticipated.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-11-RP-0057.</p>

<p>SUBJECT: Titanium Bobs</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB610020-11-02188</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: June 24, 2011</p>
<p>CONTACT POINTS: Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, 301-975-6205<br />Patrick Staines -, Contracting Officer, 301-975-6335</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Anton Paar USA, Inc of Ashland, VA for the purchase of a titanium bobs under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106 -1(b)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>A sole source determination is based on the following: Only Anton Paar can meet our technical requirements.</p>
<p>Specifically no other vendor can meet the NIST requirements for:</p>
<p>The NCNR has a requirement to obtain titanium bobs to minimize loss of time between each sample change during SANS experiments. SANS (small angle neutron scattering) is one type of neutron scattering instruments that measure the material structure from about 1 nm to about 500 nm. NCNR currently has two SANS instrument and one ultra-SANS (USANS) instrument.</p>
<p>Rheometer is an instrument that measure both stress and deformation history on a material from which useful information such as viscosity can be derived.</p>
<p>SANS experiments are short by nature and by necessity. At the NCNR, the demand for SANS instruments is often twice what is available and the average SANS experiment is only two days long. Any loss of time in any experiment severely affects the user community. For our rheometer users, a major source of lost beam time is in waiting for the sample cell to deactivate. The cells are made from grade 5 titanium and the radiological activation from neutrons requires a user to wait 45 minutes before cleaning the titanium pieces. Over the average two day experiment, a user group can study three or four samples, and would be required to wait that amount of time between each sample change, resulting in two to three hours of time lost. To minimize this loss, purchasing a second titanium bob of each size (48 mm and 49 mm diameter) is required.<br />The bobs are manufactured and sold by the same company that manufactured the SANS rheometer, Anton Paar. The replacement titanium bobs (item #91457 and #91463) must be purchased through Anton Paar because two parts of the bob are either proprietary in nature or patented. The shaft coupling that allows the bob to mount to the rheometer is of a proprietary design. The ToolMasterTM chip, an identifier chip built within the bob, is a patented device.</p>
<p>Anton Paar's titanium bobs meets these requirements and enables NIST to meet its mission requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed by July 15, 2011.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on June 24, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Christopher.ganey@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>The Intelligent System Division (ISD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducts research activities on the IEEE 1451 Smart Transducer Interface Standards for Sensors and Actuators in support of the Engineering Laboratory (EL)'s Science-based Manufacturing program.
<p>The IEEE 1451, a family of smart transducer interface standards, defines a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for connecting transducers (sensors or actuators) to microprocessors, instrumentation systems, and control/field networks. In the IEEE 1451 family, the IEEE 1451.0 standard defines a common set of commands for accessing sensors and actuators connected in various physical configurations, such as point-to-point, distributed multi-drop, and wireless, to fulfill various application needs.</p>
<p>One of the primary goals of the IEEE 1451.0 standard is to achieve data-level interoperability when multiple wired and wireless sensor networks are connected. The IEEE 1451.4 standard defines a mixed-mode interface and transducer electronic data sheet (TEDS) formats for analog transducers, which works in analog and digital operating modes. It also defines a set of templates for popular analog sensors.</p>
<p>Work under this acquisition will research and develop a wireless data acquisition (DAQ) system for the shop floor using a commercial wireless data acquisition device. This will allow ISD to gain better insights into the implementation of standard-based wireless DAQ using commercial wireless sensor nodes and sensors (IEEE 1451.4-based), apply wireless sensor networks for manufacturing shop floor applications, and show the benefits of standard-based approach for sensor data interoperability.<br /><br />The NAICS code for this requirement is 541511 with a small business size standard of $23.0 million. Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 13. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated.</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), intends to procure the Progenesis LC-MS software from Nonlinear Dynamics. The Institute intends to purchase this software by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.
<p><br />The software needed for the proposed requirement is: Progenesis Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) label-free software - single stand alone user perpetual license. This software shall combine multi fraction experiments to report protein changes across the whole experiment and shall have the ability of co-detecting peaks on aggregate runs to give a complete data set with no missing values. (Quantity 1)</p>
<p>The Laboratory at the NIH uses liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) extensively in investigating the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g. DHA) and ethanol in neuronal development and function. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, NIH is pursuing differential proteomics studies to look at the effect of DHA or ethanol on protein expression level and regulatory network in neural stem cells or brain tissues. The studies require large scale quantitative analysis of the proteins with various biological conditions. To obtain sufficient protein identification coverage, proteins extracted from each biological sample are typically fractionated into more than ten groups by SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel digestion, and MS identification and quantitation. In order to pursue the research, it is necessary for NIH to purchase a label-free protein quantitation software that can combine multi fraction experiments to report protein changes across the whole experiment.</p>
<p>Currently, Progenesis LC-MS is the only label-free protein quantitation software that satisfies these requirements and Nonlinear Dynamics is the only vendor that supplies the software and necessary technical support.</p>

SOLICITATION NUMBER:  P11PS00310PROPOSED ISSUE DATE:  On or about June 24, 2011TITLE OF PROJECT:  Visitor Education and Museum/Research Facility, Florissant Fossil Beds National MonumentDESCRIPTION:  The project consists of a new 4,422-squarefoot visitor education & museum/research facility.  Spaces inside will consist of a reception area, public toilets, exhibit area, paleontology lab, collections storage room, offices and storage. The scope includes demolition of an existing wood frame structure, minor excavation and overlot grading for the new project. Because fossil resources exist across the site, excavation will be limited and the building will feature a slab on grade with frost-protected shallow foundations, which is an unusual system in the United States. The building will be constructed of structural insulated panels (SIPS) with a wood frame roof supporting SIPS roof sheathing.   The finished floor will consists of architecturally colored concrete with multiple colors.  Two-story stone veneer piers will be constructed as accents around the main entrances.
The project has been designed to achieve LEED Gold certification.  The certification will be achieved by starting with a well insulated and tightly sealed building shell.  The project will utilize passive and active alternative energy systems include daylighting, a radiant floor heating system using evacuated tube solar panels on the roof, a passive solar ventilation system, solar exchange air preheater, and a 10 kW photovoltaic array.  
In order to achieve the LEED Gold certification, a number of unusual products and procedures must be utilized during construction.  The building shell will have to be tight enough to pass the blower door testing.  Enhanced commissioning of mechanical systems will be required.   Construction will need to utilize the latest sustainable materials and practices. This project includes, to the maximum extent practicable, use of recycled content materials, recovered materials and regional materials, low-emitting adhesives, sealants, paints, coatings, and composite wood products, and construction waste management.  Demonstrated expertise with mechanical control systems and sensitivity to the interrelationship of all building components and systems is essential to ensure that the systems function compatibly and collectively to achieve the maximum energy benefits the building is designed to provide.
Site work will include site excavation, grading, bringing utilities to the building site, coordination with local utility companies, on-site wastewater system, concrete walls, walkways, native landscaping, miscellaneous site amenities, and parking/roadway construction.  
The project will have a defined construction time frame.  The contractor must be able to coordinate with other contractors under separate contracts, including working with an exhibit fabricator to properly configure the exhibit area, and facilitate installation of exhibits.  Water and sewer contractors may be working in the area at times.  
This project will run for approximately 12 months, from November 2011 - November 2012, however, actual construction period will be variable depending on the contract award date and other possible associated factors.  Final contract period of performance will be determined after contract award and Notice-to-Proceed is given.
TYPE OF PROCUREMENT: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately EQUAL in importance to price.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.300, the government will select the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the BEST VALUE to the government, price and technical and other factors considered.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; and permits discussions if necessary.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to EDO Corporation, 430 West 5th Street, Suite 600, Panama City, Florida 32401-6357.  This IDIQ contract includes a variety of engineering services for the repair and conversion of the MK 105 and the Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS 53).  The use of task orders will provide the flexibility necessary for the different types of work required.  Under this IDIQ, EDO will provide for repair, modification and overhaul of the MK 105 and AMNS 53 systems.  This includes all depot repairs and incorporation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), including the generation of all Integrated Logistics Support documentation to support the conversions.
  This effort is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.   a)  EDO is the manufacturer and the only source for the two systems listed above.  As such, only EDO has the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel to successfully complete the system overhauls and supporting documentation as well as the other tasking specified above.  EDO is the Depot facility for the above Airborne Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) systems.  EDO is the Software Support Activity and the Drawing Configuration Manager for the MK 105 and AMNS 53 systems.  The Government views all software and drawing changes, but the software and drawings reside at EDO under Contractor control.
   b)  Given the complexity of the MK-105 and AMNS systems and the level of system knowledge required overhauling and repairing this complex equipment and systems, EDO is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking.  c)  This is a follow-on to contract N61331-09-D-0005 for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
 In summary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.     NAICS Code:  541330, Size Std: $27.0M FSC Code: R425

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><br />The proposed acquisition listed herein is unrestricted. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Program Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the Office of Child Care (OCC) within the Administration for Children and Families for the National Center on Tribal Child Care Implementation and Innovation.
<p>The RFP number is: 11-233-SOL-00271. NAICS code is 611710.</p>
<p>One of the OCC's priority goals is assisting States, Tribes, and Territories to design child care subsidy programs that are child focused, family friendly, and fair to providers. These child care subsidy programs reach all sectors of the early childhood and school age field, thus serving children birth through age twelve. The aim is to integrate child development goals and family self-sufficiency goals in order to promote increased stability and higher quality services that lead to improved child and family outcomes. <br /><br />Efficient, well run programs enhance access to services for eligible families and children and create a key link in the education of young children and the self sufficiency of families. The National Center on Tribal Child Care Implementation and Innovation will support the work of Tribal grantees related to CCDF administration by: helping Tribes create continuous quality improvement efforts as they set quality goals; developing and coordinating peer-learning opportunities and leadership development; and supporting a biennial National Conference and other trainings for Tribal grantees.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Child Care (OCC) falls within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ACF has responsibility for many programs that support the economic success of families and the well-being of children, including: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Head Start, Child Welfare, Child Support Enforcement, the Social Services Block Grant, and the new Home Visiting Program, authorized by the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>The OCC supports low-income working families through child care financial assistance and promotes children's learning by improving the quality of early care and education and after-school programs. The OCC is responsible for administering the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) - a program that helps low-income families access child care for children while parents work or participate in education or training. A portion of CCDF also is used to improve the quality of child care. In FY 2010, the OCC awarded approximately $5 billion in CCDF funds to States, Territories, and Indian Tribes through block grants.</p>
<p>Each State, Territory or Tribe appoints a Lead Agency to administer the CCDF funds. These Lead Agencies make decisions about CCDF priorities, policies, and expenditures, including: determining eligibility requirements, setting family co-payment levels, establishing provider payment rates, setting target populations, and prioritizing quality investments. States, Territories and Tribes are required to complete a comprehensive planning process every two years, and to provide information on child care policies to ACF in biennial CCDF Plans.</p>
<p>The majority of CCDF monies are used to subsidize the cost of care for low-income families, typically through certificates or vouchers that families can use to pay the provider of their choice. In addition, States and larger tribal grantees are required to commit at least 4 percent of their total CCDF to quality enhancement activities such as consumer education, resource and referral services, provider training, and caregiver recruitment and retention. Additional targeted funds (designated for quality improvement activities, infant and toddler care, school-age child care, child care resource and referral, and research) further support State efforts to improve child care access and quality.</p>
<p>The CCDF Planning Process:</p>
<p>OCC recently revamped the Tribal Child Care and Development Fund Plan Preprint for 2012-2013, which will serve as the application and blueprint for Tribe's work in CCDF in the coming biennium. In this revision, to better understand Tribal practices, OCC made changes to ask Tribes to describe: efforts to help subsidized families access quality care (including setting quality improvement goals for the biennium); program integrity activities and strategies; provide additional information on payment rates. The Tribal CCDF Plans will be an important resource for the work of this Center.</p>
<p>Tribal Child Care:</p>
<p>Public Law 104-193 amended the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (CCDBG) to reserve "not less than one percent and no more than two percent" of the aggregate Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) funds for Indian Tribes. HHS elected to reserve the full two percent set-aside. In FY 2011, 260 Tribal grantees were awarded $100 million in CCDF funds. Over 535 federally recognized Indian Tribes, Alaska Native Villages, and a Native Hawaiian organization received CCDF funds directly or through consortium arrangements. Thirty-three (33) Tribes elect to add their CCDF Funds into a consolidated Employment, Training and Related Services Plan, authorized by Public Law 102-477. These 33 Tribes received nearly one-third of the FY 2011 CCDF funds. The CCDF regulations provide significant flexibility for Tribes to design and administer their programs in accordance with the unique needs and challenges in their communities. With some exceptions, Tribal CCDF grantees are located in rural, economically challenged areas.</p>
<p>Office of Child Care Technical Assistance:</p>
<p>OCC has established a Child Care Technical Assistance Network (CCTAN) to support the work of States, Territories, and Tribes that administer the CCDF. In the years 2007-2011 CCTAN Projects included: After-school Investments; the Center on the Social and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning; Child Care Aware; Child Care and Early Education Research Connections; the Child Care Information System Technical Assistance Project; the Communications Management Center; Healthy Child Care America; the National Child Care Information and Technical Assistance Center; the National Infant and Toddler Child Care Initiative; the Tribal Child Care Technical Assistance Center, and the Child Care Improper Payments Initiative.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, OCC will re-compete its CCTAN to specialize in core areas, including the following new projects:</p>
<p>- The National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement will support CCDF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;grantees as they build quality improvement systems that create pathways to <br />&nbsp; excellence for child care providers.<br /><br />- The National Center on Child Care Professional Development Systems and&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Workforce Initiatives will build State capacity to produce qualified child care&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; professionals. (Jointly funded with Office of Head Start)<br /><br />- The National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability will&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;support CCDF Administrators as they develop child care subsidy systems that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;are child-focused, family-friendly, fair to child care providers and operate with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;strong program integrity.</p>
<p>- The State Child Care Systems Specialist Network will work with Regional staff<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;and other OCC TA Centers to customize TA and coordinate a team to help<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;States reach the goals outlined in their CCDF Plans.<br /><br />The National Center on Tribal Child Care Implementation and Innovation will play a key role in the new CCTAN, coordinating with other CCTAN projects to support tribal CCDF grantees as they implement their new FY 2012-2013 Tribal CCDF plans. The Center will also share with the CCTAN Tribal-State best practices, and other program administration strategies and innovations that have replication potential for all CCDF grantees.</p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about, but no sooner than 15 days after the issuance of this notice. All responsible sources may submit proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The closing date will be approximately 60 days after issuance of the RFP.</p>

<DESC><br />The proposed acquisition listed herein is unrestricted. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Program Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the Office of Child Care (OCC) within the Administration for Children and Families for the National Center on Child Care Professional Development Systems and Workforce Initiatives.
<p><br />The RFP number is: 11-233-SOL-00258. NAICS code is 611710.</p>
<p>The Office of Child Care (OCC) falls within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ACF has responsibility for many programs that support the economic success of families and the well-being of children, including: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Head Start, Child Welfare, Child Support Enforcement, and the Social Services Block Grant.</p>
<p>The OCC supports low-income working families through child care financial assistance and promotes children's learning by improving the quality of early care and education and after-school programs. The OCC is responsible for administering the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) - a program that helps low-income families access child care for children while parents work or participate in education or training. A portion of CCDF also is used to improve the quality of child care. In FY 2010, the OCC awarded over $5 billion in CCDF funds to States, Territories, and Indian Tribes through block grants. States and Territories invest $1 billion each year in quality improvements, much of which supports professional development and workforce initiatives.</p>
<p>Each State, Territory or Tribe appoints a Lead Agency to administer the CCDF funds. These Lead Agencies make decisions about CCDF priorities, policies, and expenditures, including: determining eligibility requirements, setting family co-payment levels, establishing provider payment rates, setting target populations, and prioritizing quality investments. States, Territories and Tribes are required to complete a comprehensive planning process every two years, and to provide information on child care policies to ACF in biennial CCDF Plans.</p>
<p>The majority of CCDF monies are used to subsidize the cost of care for low-income families. States have options including contracting with community providers, blending funds with Head Start and public preschool programs to purchase spaces for eligible children but typically CCDF grantees provide certificates or vouchers that families can use to pay the provider of their choice. In addition, States are required to commit at least 4 percent of their total CCDF to quality enhancement activities such as consumer education, resource and referral services, provider training, and caregiver recruitment and retention. Additional targeted funds (designated for quality improvement activities, infant and toddler care, school-age child care, child care resource and referral, and research) further support State efforts to improve child care access and quality. States elect to spend more than the required amount of CCDF for quality improvement - averaging 11% - or almost $1 billion per year. Training and professional development for the child care workforce is a major focus of these expenditures.<br /><br />The OCC recognizes that workforce and professional development initiatives are at the heart of quality improvement efforts and strongly support systemic quality approaches recognizing that every State and Territory is at a different stage of the process.</p>
<p>OCC's revision of the Child Care and Development Fund Plan application (known as the Preprint) has a revamped section focusing specifically on State and Territory professional development and workforce activities. In summer 2011, States will report on their current workforce activities and set goals for the FY 2012-2013 Biennium. In 2013, States and Territories will begin reporting on the progress towards child care quality improvement through an annual progress report known as the Quality Performance Report that will include key data on workforce activities and outcomes. The revised CCDF Plan and reporting will yield important information to help this Center target technical assistance efforts.</p>
<p>In spring 2011, OCC will implement quality benchmarks to track State quality improvement efforts across the States and Territories in a consistent manner. The indicators will include a handful that focus on professional development and workforce supports, aligned with many of the new items in the CCDF Plans. These indicators, along with the CCDF Plan information, will be another resource to the Center as it designs technical assistance for the States and Territories. The Center's development of informational products and technical assistance should take place within the context of each State's licensing, quality rating and improvement systems (QRIS) or other quality improvement system.</p>
<p>OCC has established a Child Care Technical Assistance Network (CCTAN) to support the work of States, Territories, and Tribes that administer the CCDF. In the years 2007-2011 OCC funded the following individual Projects: After-school Investments; the Center on the Social and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning; Child Care Aware; Child Care and Early Education Research Connections; the Child Care Information System Technical Assistance Project; the Communications Management Center; Healthy Child Care America; the National Child Care Information and Technical Assistance Center; the National Infant and Toddler Child Care Initiative; the Tribal Child Care Technical Assistance Center, and the Child Care Improper Payments Initiative.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, OCC will recompete its Child Care Technical Assistance Network to specialize in core areas, including the following new projects:</p>
<p>~ The National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement will support CCDF grantees as they build quality improvement systems that create pathways to excellence for child care providers. <br /><br />~ The National Center on Child Care Professional Development Systems and Workforce Initiatives will build State capacity to produce qualified child care professionals. (Jointly funded with Office of Head Start)</p>
<p>~ The National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability will support CCDF Administrators as they develop child care subsidy systems that are child-focused, family-friendly, fair to child care providers and operate with strong program integrity.</p>
<p>~ The State Child Care Systems Specialist Network will assist CCDF Administrators as they develop an integrated plan for moving forward on their CCDF Plan goals by providing expert consultation and assembling a team of experts from the Centers as needed.</p>
<p>OCC will focus on raising the bar on quality in child care across the country through these Centers. Research shows that child care quality matters even more for low-income children. The most recent findings from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development found that the quality of child care that children received in their preschool years had small but detectable effects on their academic success and behavior all the way into adolescence. Despite the importance of quality, the research and data available indicate that the quality of our Nation's child care, on average, is inadequate to support children's learning and development to help them succeed in school and in life.</p>
<p>The National Center on Child Care Professional Development Systems and Workforce Initiatives and the National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement will provide technical assistance to States and Territories as they build and strengthen quality improvement systems. The two centers will share information and coordinate efforts, as appropriate and directed by OCC.</p>
<p>Research has demonstrated the impact of the child care workforce on a child's success in school and life. Warm and responsive interactions between caregivers and young children influence a child's developing brain architecture, social competence, thinking and reasoning skills. When caregivers provide young children with cognitively stimulating activities and consistent, secure relationships children will grow happy, healthy and ready to learn.</p>
<p>Professional development and workforce supports are needed to increase the continuity of care needed to build these secure relationships with a child care workforce that experiences turnover rates of approximately 30% per year, a national median wage of $9.25 and a decline in the number of teachers with college degrees.</p>
<p>In May 2009, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data estimated there were 595,650 child care workers in the US. These numbers, however, only include professionals in licensed facilities. There are an estimated 2.3 million paid child care providers working in varied settings including public and private, profit and nonprofit, faith-based, community-based, school-based, home-based, and employer-sponsored providers. Approximately 35 percent of child care workers are self-employed, with the majority of these workers serving as family child care providers. Of these 2.3 million paid child care providers, nearly half care for toddlers aged 19 through 36 months. There is little data available about the informal sector of child care, although it makes up a large number of child care providers in the United States.</p>
<p>All sectors of the ECE field require a well-qualified workforce with opportunities for growth from entry level through master teacher, including the many additional roles in the child care system (e.g. consultants, technical assistance providers, trainers, and higher education faculty). Lack of access to professional development that leads to progressively higher levels of competency is a barrier to providing access to high-quality early childhood education for all children. CCDF dollars provide access to child care for children from low-income families however the credentials or training offered in one state may not be recognized by Departments of Education preschool programs, Early Head Start, Head Start or neighboring state or territory systems.</p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about, but no sooner than 15 days after the issuance of this notice. All responsible sources may submit proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The closing date will be approximately 60 days after issuance of the RFP.</p>

<DESC>US Government Seeks Expression of Interest in Cheyenne WY<br />1WY2002
<p><br />Requirement:<br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 4,335 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3,300 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (ABOA). The lease term requirement is for five (5) years. The space must be available for occupancy by September 30, 2013.</p>
<p>The Government will require 3 surface parking spaces.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Please send expressions of interest to:</p>
<p>Rachel Shanahan<br />UGL Services-Equis Operations <br />8350 E. Crescent Parkway, Suite 300<br />Greenwood Village, CO 80111<br />Rachel.Shanahan@na.ugllimited.com<br />Direct: 303-729-2342</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest must be submitted to the above address by 4:00 p.m. MST on June 27, 2011, and must include the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.<br />&bull; Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet to be offered and expected rental rate per ABOA, fully serviced. Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount of tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.<br />&bull; Date of space availability.<br />&bull; Method of rentable space measurement.<br />&bull; Building ownership information.<br />&bull; Amount of parking available on-site and its costs. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the Government required parking (if any).<br />&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.<br />&bull; List of building services provided.<br />The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<DESC>The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) is the Department of Defense (DoD) demonstration and validation program for environmental technologies.  The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for innovative environmental and energy technology demonstrations that address DoD requirements as candidates for funding.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCP's intent to competitively fund demonstration projects as described in the Program Announcement on the DoD ESTCP web site.<BR><BR>The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found at www.estcp.org/opportunities.  No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Awards will take the form of contracts.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan. <BR><BR>To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the Instructions on the web site, no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on Thursday, March 4, 2010.  No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.  <BR>Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a two-stage review process.  The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to get initial Government feedback on their technologies without incurring the expense of a full proposal.  Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by the Government, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal.  Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification.  <BR>A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work.  There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made for a demonstration.  Multiple awards may be made to address a particular topic area.  It is expected that awards totaling approximately $20.0 million will result depending on availability of funds.  <BR><BR>For awards to be made as contracts, evaluation shall include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, HUD Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business concerns, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 500 employees.  In addition, contract proposals that exceed $550,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.

For the purchase of Brain Vision's: BP-02683, BP-02221, BP-02054, & BP-02111, & the accessories needed to acquire physiologic data with this equipment
June 3, 2011
From: Ron Goodman, PhD., Human Motor Performance Lab

Process and procedures of work to be accomplished with this procurement:

Our lab is involved with research and development for optimizing motor-learning-based exercise (task-oriented) and robotics interventions aimed at increasing recovery from stroke in Veterans. In order to better understand the neurophysiologic components associated with successful rehabilitation strategies we employ electrophysiological data acquisition. Currently we collect electroencephalographic (EEG) data, a measure of brain electrical activity to track the changes in the neurophysiologic parameters that are associated with successful motor learning and functional gains in walking and balance for stroke victims. This affords a higher resolution of the factors involved with recovery from stroke and increases our ability to design more efficacious interventions. The proposed procurement is a complementary amplifier (made by the manufacturer of our current/existing EEG system) and data acquisition system that allows for the collection of autonomic and muscle activity data, simultaneous with the EEG.  The simultaneous collection of brain and body signals gives us the ability to time-lock the various data streams and more fully understand the complex interactions of human brain and body systems. Once again to emphasize: the combination of brain and body measures provides a deeper look into the physiological factors involved with both, the impairment and successful recovery from stroke. The proposed procurement in combination with our existing equipment greatly enhances our capabilities for designing more efficacious interventions to increase recovery from stroke for our Veterans.

<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</strong><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />DoD is developing a Terminal &amp; Networking Roadmap (TNR) that engages with the DoD Laboratories to identify future technology insertion opportunities, that solicits gaps and issues from the Operational Community to determine communications needs as captured in DoD Roadmaps/Visions (i.e. Air Force 2020 Vision), and that discovers emerging technologies within Industry developed through research and development (R&amp;D) or from leveraging existing commercial IT advancements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TNR will <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>provide decision makers with an enterprise level "strategic view" that lays out a timeline for making key decisions about terminal and networking technologies and defines the data required to make those decisions.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;MILSATCOM is a vital piece of the DoD communications architecture as it provides the space-based network connectivity needed to deliver global communications to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>tactical national security operations in areas that lack terrestrial infrastructure, as well as to mobile platforms. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The TNR will help decision makers within the DoD to examine all current, evolving, and futuristic ground networking infrastructure, and terminal architecture technologies that will be available in the 2020 to 2030 timeframe. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This examination will allow the DoD to take advantage of these capabilities and move forward on a path towards developing mitigation strategies for existing capability/requirement gaps and threats. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>With the current cancellation of the TSAT program, the role of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) constellations is anticipated to expand to fill MILSATCOM capability and functionality gaps. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>DoD also turns to commercial SATCOM (COMSATCOM) assets to fill in essential bandwidth gaps, and appears willing to continue exploring SATCOM options such as leased capability and hosted payloads in the future.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><br />The operational requirements of the MILSATCOM terminal architecture are moving towards full functionality across multiple frequency bands and communication protocols. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>As such, future MILSATCOM architecture components (terminals, systems, ground infrastructure, etc.) should be designed with both the flexibility and adaptability to operate across different MILSATCOM satellite systems and communications layers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Commonality at the component level would increase terminal affordability and interoperability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order for DoD to maximize the use of its existing SATCOM resources while leveraging new technologies, joint service collaboration and planning must be a part of a forward-moving strategy that focuses on; increased terminal capabilities, affordability, a unified approach to network management and connectivity, and decreased IA vulnerabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><br />The path to develop enhanced satellite terminals is challenging because many of the legacy satellite terminals and associated satellite systems were designed to function as independent systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Integrating these legacy systems with new technologies to meet DoD demands for a more interoperable, integrated SATCOM architecture is a huge challenge. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>An integral piece of this new architecture is the interoperability of the space, aerial, and terrestrial communications layers. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Changes in SATCOM demand (increased AISR and Communications On The Move (COTM), for example) within this integrated architecture require us to leverage legacy assets while exploring new technologies, incorporating a mix of SATCOM options to successfully meet the warfighter's operational requirements.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is an effort to conduct market research for use in formulating an acquisition plan/strategy to obtain essential contractor services to provide the National Museum of the  Marine Corps with contractor support for the storage, safe handling and transport of their fine art. The Regional Contracting Office, National Capital Region (RCO-NCR) is requesting responses from qualified businesses concerns.  The qualifying NAICS code for this effort is 493120.  

The National Museum for the Marine has a collection of Marine Corps Art that represents over two (2) centuries of eye-witness accounts of the Marines in battle, enduring the anguish, routine, boredom and peril that are the Marines.
  This 8,000-piece collection is worth approximately $12 Million and includes works by nationally and internationally recognized artists.  The majority of the collection includes works on paper and stretched canvas.  Some works are painted on wood, metal, masonite and other substrates.  There are several works of sculpture made of bronze, wood, plaster and stone.  The dimensions of the works range from 1.5 tall  x 2 wide to over 56 tall x 106 wide.  The paintings in the collection range in age from the early 18th century to the present day.  The Art Collections collection rationale has, as its primary focus, fine art that documents the creation and history of the Continental Marines and Unites States Marine Corps.
  The National Museum of  the Marine Corps will acquire works dating back to 1775 if the opportunity presents itself.  

In 2006, due to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission, the National Museum of the Marine Corps had to safely relocate its art collection from building 58 in the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D. C. to the vicinity of the National Museum for the Marine Corps, Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia.  In searching for suitable storage facility aboard the base, a 20-month, comprehensive search was conducted without success resulting in seeking a location locally.  This climate-controlled storage space must be located within a five-mile radius of the National Museum of the Marine Corps to minimize risk to artwork and artifacts during transit to and from the National Museum of the Marine Corps for exhibit development and implementation.
  

CORE OBJECTIVES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED 

1.  The Government requires up to 8,000 square feet of climate controlled storage space, to include a dust-free environment at a consistent temperature of 68-72 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 50 percent with a sealed concrete floor, or equivalent, with measures to prevent leaching of humidity, mold etc. for the storage of the art collection.  The Government shall have secure access on a 24/7 basis of the facility for designated Museum staff curators. 

2. The Contractor shall provide curator access to and control of the climatic conditions (e.g. the HVAC system) 24/7; standard, 110 volt electrical power, a curator-controlled double-level security system, lighting and smoke detectors.
 The Government must be able to control lighting in zones, with the ability to set, maintain and revise lighting as artifacts and exhibits are changed out, with the intent of minimizing light exposure in the critical art storage areas.  

3.  The Government must be able to access, move, reposition, load, unload large artwork and artifacts within the climate controlled area without damage or dismantling of the artifacts.  The climate-controlled area must be accessible to the Government by loading dock and of sufficient magnitude to allow the Government to operate government- or contractor-owned forklifts to load and unload large artwork and artifacts within the climate controlled area using a high-density mobile storage system on rails.

4.
 The Contractor shall provide the Government with barrier-free access to artwork and artifacts in compliance with the American with Disabilities Act (ADA).  The Contractor shall provide access to parking for up to six government personnel and vehicles at any one time.  

5.  Storage Space is required within a five mile radius of the National Museum of the Marine Corps, Marine Corps Base (MCB), Quantico VA with restroom facilities available to the curatorial staff.  Minimally, the Contractor must have the capability to clean restrooms once per week.

<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Contracting Officer, Email christopher.glista@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will host an online Proposers' Day webinar to provide background information and Government expectations associated with the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Component, Context, and Manufacturing Model Library 1 (C2M2L-1), which was posted as DARPA-BAA-11-47 &lt;https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/DARPA-BAA-11-47/listing.html&gt; on June 6, 2011. The webinar will occur as an open-invite, web-based video telecast and simultaneous internet chat session starting at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, June 23, 2011. All interested parties are welcome.<br /><br />
<p>DARPA's Adaptive Vehicle Make (AVM) portfolio of programs is aimed at compressing at least five-fold the development timelines for new, complex cyber-electro-mechanical systems such as military vehicles. Under AVM, DARPA is pursuing the development of several elements of enabling infrastructure aimed at radically transforming the systems engineering/design/verification (META), manufacturing (iFAB), and innovation (vehicleforge.mil) elements of the overall "make" process for delivering new defense systems or variants. Each of these infrastructure capabilities is largely generic (i.e., applicable to any cyber-electro-mechanical system). In order to exercise these capabilities in the context of a relevant military system, DARPA intends to build FANG-the Fast, Adaptable, Next-Generation Ground Vehicle-a new heavy infantry fighting vehicle. The C2M2L-1 solicitation will be for the first round of domain-specific models needed to enable the design, verification, and fabrication of the drivetrain and mobility subsystems of the FANG vehicle using the META, iFAB, and vehicleforge.mil infrastructure. Subsequent C2M2L solicitations are expected to address the chassis and survivability subsystems and eventually all of the subsystem domains needed to construct and verify a complete infantry fighting vehicle.</p>
<p>This Special Notice is issued solely for information and program planning purposes. Attendance at the Proposers' Day is voluntary and is not required to propose to the solicitation. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this event.</p>
<p>Participation Instructions:<br />To facilitate participation by the broadest possible cross-section of the community in the formulation of the final C2M2L-1 solicitation, DARPA is hosting the C2M2L-1 Proposers' Day Webcast using Adobe Connect.</p>
<p>By registering using the website described below, you will be provided with your Adobe Connect username and password as well as the URL for the Proposers' Day webcast.</p>
<p>To join the meeting, click on the URL provided and enter your username and password.</p>
<p>As a participant, you will have the ability to send in comments and questions via the chat feature. Chat messages will be responded to intermittently during the session.</p>
<p>Interested parties must register to participate in the interactive webcast, join the online discussion forum/message board, or be placed on the contact info list. DARPA reserves the right to limit the number of participants per organization, but does not presently anticipate doing so.</p>
<p>The registration website is: &lt;https://www.schafertmd.com/conference/c2m2l/&gt;</p>
<p>The registration deadline is 1 p.m. EDT, Monday, June 20, 2011.</p>

The Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has an ongoing need for a wide variety of very complex targets for Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) and related High Energy Density Physics (HEDP) experiments.  The NNSA program in ICF is an important component of the agency?s Stockpile Stewardship Program.  Stockpile Stewardship allows the United States Government to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear arsenal without nuclear testing.  ICF/HEDP targets are complex, multi-component, systems often employing specialized materials.  Planar (flat) targets for the ICF/HEDP Program will be provided through the planned solicitation described here and more fully in the Draft RFP.

<RESPDATE>062711
<ARCHDATE>01312012
<CONTACT>John M Inman, Phone 907-228-6231, Email jinman@fs.fed.us
<DESC><p>On Wednesday, June 8, 2011, the Forest Service amended its previous posting of February 2, 2011, to release the draft plans for the Forest Highway 43 Road Improvements project, and to provide some additional information for the benefit of prospective offerors. The Federal Acquisition Regulation encourages exchanges of information among interested parties (such as prospective offerors and Government acquisition personnel) from the earliest identification of a requirement through receipt of offers, consistent with procurement integrity requirements. The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing prospective offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality construction services at reasonable prices.<br /><br />The purpose of this posting is to announce to industry that the Forest Service contemplates holding a presolicitation conference for the benefit of prospective offerors by telephone on Thursday, June 30, 2011, at 9:15 am, using phone number (907) 586-9398. Any prospective offeror choosing to participate should have already reviewed the draft plans mentioned in the paragraph above, and are invited to submit questions regarding the plans by fax to (907) 228-6254 (Subj: FH-43 Presolicitation Conference) so that Forest Service acquisition personnel can address these questions at the conference. Please submit questions before close of business on Monday, June 27, 2011.<br /><br />The Forest Service contemplates sharing information regarding the acquisition approach at the presolicitation conference, as such information may be available at that time. At this moment in time, the solicitation issuance date is uncertain but sometime after the presolicitation conference date, but it is likely that whenever the solicitation invitation for bids is released it will be for a period of only thirty days. Accordingly, prospective offerors are urged to review the draft plans which were released on June 8, 2011, so that they will have the maximum advantage in responding to the solicitation in a timely manner. At this moment in time, the Forest Service does not anticipate any changes between the draft and the final plans.<br /><br />Participation in the presolicitation conference is elective at the prospective offeror's discretion. Because this will be a telephone conference, an attendance roll will not be taken. Amenable to federal laws, recording of phone calls is not allowed. The Forest Service will prepare minutes of the conference for later posting on FedBizOpps. Prospective offerors who want to attend in person may do so by coming to the Forest Service's conference room on the first floor of the Ketchikan federal building (the pink building) at the time of the conference on a first-come, first-seated basis. No documents will be released at the meeting; rather, it is contemplated that all documents related to this acquisition will be made available on the FedBizOpps website or according to instructions which may be included in the solicitation.<br /><br />At this moment in time, the Forest Service does not contemplate hosting a site visit at the project site. However, the site is public property and prospective offerors are urged to visit the site at their convenience. The clauses at FAR 52.236-2, Differing Site Conditions, and 52.236-3, Site Investigations and Conditions Affecting the Work, are intended for inclusion in the planned contract; accordingly, prospective offerors are urged and expected to inspect the site where the work will be performed.<br /><br />The primary specifications for this project will be the Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges on Federal Highway Projects, FP-03. FP-03 U. S. Customary Units is a separately published book available electronically at http://www.flh.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/pse/specs/, or in paper from the Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration. A Forest Service supplemental specifications package will be released with the solicitation.<br /><br />The number AG-0116-SS-11-0043 is used within FedBizOpps solely for administrative convenience. When the solicitation is issued, it will likely be numbered with only one "S": AG-0116-S-11-0043.</p>

<p>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), National Soil Survey Center (NSSC), located in Lincoln, NE, intends to award a sole source fixed price purchase order to Perkin Elmer (PE) Health Sciences Inc., located at 710 Bridge Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, CT 06484-4794.</p>
<p>This award is being procured under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A), Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>The NSSC conducts various laboratory and field analyses and studies associated with soils disciplines, method development and national initiatives. Currently, NSSC uses PE's AAnalyst (AA) 300 Atomic Absorption Spectrometer, which was purchased several years ago. This instrument needs to be upgraded with the AA400 model, which will allow a systematic upgrade to transition with the AA300. The AA400 software is compatible with the AA300 model and uses the same software platform that would allow the copying of existing methods. Both models interface with each other and are interchangeable with existing accessories, hardware, and supplies that are stocked by NSSC (lamps, nebulizers, etc). To compete this award would create substantial duplication of costs in which the Government is not expected to recover.</p>

Based on NRC's market research, it is imperative that ATI provide the continued maintenance of the proprietary software of the Avaya system in order to provide continuity through the completion of the installation and follow up service. However, any responsible sources that can demonstrate that they, too, can provide the required maintenance may respond to this notice to so indicate. Any such response to this notice must be in writing and must include clear and convincing evidence of that capability to provide the required renewal, including any written authorization from ATI. Written responses must be submitted to wanda.brown@nrc.gov so that it is received at that email address no later than June 27, 2011. A determination whether to compete this requirement will be based on whether other responsible, authorized sources are identified as a result of this notice. Questions may be submitted to Ms. Brown via email at wanda.brown@nrc.gov. No solicitation document is currently available</p>

<DESC>CCAT on behalf of DHS TechSolutions is soliciting proposals for development,integration, test, and validation of technologies that provide technologysolutions that address mission capability gaps identified by the FirstResponder community and to facilitate transition of technologies to FirstResponder agencies that provide a minimum 80% near-term (12  15 monthtimeframe) solution for an operational requirement.  Technologies that helpfirefighters, law enforcement personnel, and emergency management techniciansto perform their respective jobs more effectively while enhancing public safetyare of particular interest.  The goal of this Announcement is to awardapplicants that offer a project plan that will advance the technologysreadiness to a pre-production prototype for insertion into real-worldoperational demonstrations conducted by TechSolutions and teams of FirstResponders.  Upon successful completion of the tests and demonstrations, it isexpected that the organization will be able to complete final systemdevelopment and commercialization to achieve ultimate transition to FirstResponder markets.

<DESC>Special Notice
<p>Classification Code: S - Utilities and Housekeeping Services<br />NAICS Code: 561720</p>
<p>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE to communicate TSA's intent to award a firm fixed price contract to Ka Lima O Maui, 95 Mahalani Street, Wailuku, HI 96793 on a sole source basis, for the purchase of janitorial services at checkpoint and baggage space at the Kahului International Airport (OGG). The period of performance will be a total of one (1) year.</p>
<p>This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice. This contract is being awarded to a Nonprofit Agency serving people with other severe disabilities (AbilityOne).</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration was created in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act signed into law by President George W. Bush on November 19, 2001. The Office of Field Real Estate Services (OFRES) is responsible for all TSA real estate space occupied by the TSA on and off airport. TSA currently occupies 11,603 square feet of checkpoint and baggage space at OGG. TSA space must be located on airport property for TSA to effectively carry out its mission. Airport space must be cleaned on a daily basis due to heavy passenger traffic.</p>
<p>An effort was made in 2010 to solicit potential sources for this requirement; however, sources on Maui were limited and there was little interest in the requirement. The TSA sought out other avenues to obtain services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration intends to negotiate with only one source; no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement. Therefore, proposals will not be accepted directly on this requirement.</p>
<p>This contract will be negotiated with Ka Lima O Maui and ultimately awarded without further notice.</p>

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice and is not a request for proposals. This is for information purposes only.<br><br>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, intends to issue a sole source contract to Colorado State University for Over-wash Testing Services. The services to be provided by the contractor include the transportation of Florida soils to contractor's work site, the construction of trays needed for testing, filling of the trays with specified materials, and monitoring trays during one full growing season. These trays will then be used to test protected slope levee armoring materials, subjected to hurricane overtopping waves with a maximum height of 8.0 feet and a maximum wave period of 7.7 seconds. Testing facilities use large U-shaped sloped concrete flumes since this is the only known way to simulate ocean waves overtopping full scale levees. The tests are performed by flowing large quantities of water intermittently (to model wave overtopping) over grass and Turf Reinforcement Mats (TRM), for six hours (per test) within 2 side by side 6' x 50' steel trays in a 13' wide concrete chute (flume) that is over 50 feet long on a 1 on 3 slope. By testing these levee armoring materials to failure, it can determine their adequacy to protect the levees. The testing results will be used for Corps' decision making as to which armoring alternatives will be used for the various overtopping flow rates for the levees around Herbert Hoover Dike, C-43 Reservoir, and Everglades Agricultural Area, and C-44 Reservoir, all within the state of Florida.<br><br>In order to receive notification of any changes to this notification, interested vendors must REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

                  Practices that eliminate competition, such as collusive bidding, may warrant criminal, civil, or

                    in accordance with 41 CFR 101-45.317.1.

<DESC>AFRL/RZP seeks to develop and demonstrate a subscale power and thermal management system to assess the integration issues and transient behavior when implemented with a directed energy weapon (DEW) or high peak power aircraft loads. This program seeks to utilize existing state-of-the-art hardware with minimal development to implement a flexible power and thermal management capability at AFRL/RZP facilities at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. It is the intent of this effort to issue awards to one or more contractors which will work with AFRL researchers and existing on-site support contractors as part of a government / industry / academia collaborative team to design, build, and test the subscale power and thermal management system test bed. This facility will eventually be located in AFRL's INVENT Simulation Integration Facility (ISIF) and be capable of operationally evaluating different power and thermal management strategies for advanced DEW and energy optimized aircraft (EOA) concepts. Cost sharing is encouraged for this effort.

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.12 requires prospective contractors to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov, in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

Additionally, prospective contractors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete.  This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. The main changes to the solicitation are the implementation of the Goldstar Initiative.

FSS Contractors that have agreed to standard contract clauses without taking exception will receive a 'Goldstar' next to their name in GSA eLibrary. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous, and will contain contracts with periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusive of any options) from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to any option to extend the term of the contract, or cancelled sooner. This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2,500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. Any paper offer received will be rejected as non-responsive. Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror. Schedule 736 is a mandatory eOffer schedule.

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to several months before your offer is evaluated. 

Description:

Proposal Assistance: 

Read Me First: An overview of the MAS Program, this document attempts to help the vendor decide if a schedule contract is right for them and provides general information about contracting with the U.S. Government. Do not submit with your proposal.

Solicitation: This document includes all contract clauses and should be downloaded for future reference. It also includes Supplemental Instructions for preparing a proposal. (Note that various choices exist due to the variety of products addressed by this schedule, notably FOB terms. Please disregard clauses which do not reflect your commercial practices.) Do not submit with your proposal.


SF 1449: This Standard Form will serve as the first page of any contract which may be awarded. Due to the nature of schedules, not all blocks apply, so please complete blocks 12, 17 and 30 only. See the Solicitation document, Supplemental Instructions, for further information about this form. REQUIRED.

Regulations Incorporated by Reference: Here, you will find the full text of those clauses which are incorporated by reference in the Solicitation document. (Of particular interest to many MAS 58I contractors is clause 52.225-5, Trade Agreements. Be sure to consult this clause before offering a product which is not manufactured in the United States.) Do not submit with your proposal.

Past Performance Evaluation (PPE): Because a PPE, or Open Ratings Report, must be submitted with the proposal, here you will find instructions on how to order such a report. Do not submit instructions with your proposal.

Small Business Subcontracting Plan: This document addresses the work the vendor intends to subcontract to small businesses. REQUIRED when applicable.

Proposal Price List Preparation: There are no specific requirements for pricelists under this schedule. This form reminds you that clauses I-FSS-594 and I-FSS-600 will apply after a contract has been awarded.

Letter of Supply: Here, you will find a template of the form required for non-manufacturers. REQUIRED when applicable.

Proposed Discounts: Though this information may be addressed throughout a proposal, this spreadsheet serves as a summary and focal point. REQUIRED when applicable.

<DESC>To be the Governments leader in acquisition services, GSA sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs. With the recent award of 15 BPAs of Office Supplies in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) and to best allocate government resources, GSA temporarily postponed Schedule 75 to new Multiple Awards Schedules (MAS) offers for 24 months, effective October 1, 2010. At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program. 

*This solicitation continues to be postponed to new offers.

GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program. Since holding a schedule contract is a very expensive proposition for the schedule holder and GSA, we are reallocating our resources to better serve our customer base. Current Schedule 75 contract holders with available options that are successfully performing will continue to be exercised. Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored.

<DESC><br />The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order for the supplies listed below. The requirement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.106.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 11-223-SOL-00116. This is a 100% small business set-aside.<br /><br />This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50, May 16, 2011.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Introduction<br />The following scope outlines the need for the purchase of an ELISpot reader capable of high sensitivity and accuracy to determine T-cell proliferation as a surrogate marker for the immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins. Generally the signals expected from the foreign peptides in the bioassays are relatively small. Thus the technology requires a machine with both high sensitivity and accuracy to avoid getting either false positive or false negative signals.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has initiated a new project on the pharmacogenetics of immunogenicity. Our hypothesis is that identical therapeutic proteins may elicit different immunogenic responses in individual patients. Sequence mismatch between the endogenous (albeit nonfunctional) protein and the infused protein and the HLA Class II repertoire of the patient may contribute to these differences in response. The purpose of the ELISpot reader is to determine if the mismatched peptides can stimulate T-cells from the patients own blood (i.e. with the same HLA Class II repertoire). To accurately test this hypothesis which is central to the project CBER requires a reader that is both sensitive and accurate.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
 Only the source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Naval Inventory Control Point Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
 Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.  The NAVICP Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx"

<DESC>The following is merely an overview of the requirement.  See all attachments for the complete solicitation package. <br /><br />__________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) requires facilities management, maintenance &amp; logistics support services for the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) training facility/campus in Roswell, New Mexico.  <br /><br /><strong>Overview of Scope</strong> <br /><br /><br />
<p>PROGRAM SUMMARY: The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) advises the President, Secretary of State, other bureaus in the Department of State, and other departments and agencies within the U.S. Government on the development of policies and programs to combat international narcotics and crime.</p>
<p>One of INL's major goals is the enhancement of the professionalism of foreign criminal justice officials to enable them to efficiently combat crime in their respective countries and, at the same time, prevent the movement of transnational criminal elements into the United States and throughout the world. An effective and efficient way to accomplish this goal was the creation of an ILEA providing training to a global student body. In furtherance of this effort the Department of State established an International Law Enforcement Academy located in Roswell, New Mexico. The ILEA in Roswell became operational in 2001. The Academy has a dedicated campus facility with two training rooms, a series of small break-out rooms, administrative offices, a computer lab, and office space for instructors.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide facility management and maintenance for the ILEA Roswell facility in Roswell, NM. The contractor shall also provide delegation logistical support for international students attending the ILEA Roswell training program in Roswell, NM. INL plans to host approximately 400 - 500 foreign government officials per year, multiple weeks at a time, as participants in various Department of State foreign policy and technical outreach training programs.</p>
<p>The contractor will coordinate all activities - facility and international delegations logistics - with the ILEA training facilitator to support the overall ILEA training program.</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Government is conducting a single source selection under this solicitation and intends to award one (1) contract by conducting a 100% HUBZone set-aside competition in accordance with FAR Part 15. We anticipate a one year contract with four one-year options which the Government reserves the right to unilaterally exercise any or all one-year options (IAW FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract).</p>
<p><strong>Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.</strong></p>
<p>QUESTIONS: Prospective offeror(s) should submit any questions regarding this solicitation in writing by e-mail Contract Specialist, Terry Lord. First round questions must be received by 2PM EST; Tuesday, June 21, 2011 to ensure a timely response. Questions received after that date will not be answered prior to the date established for the receipt of proposals. Second round questions, if necessary, will be conducted after the site visit planned for June 28, 2011. Second round questions are, for the time being, due by 2PM EST; Friday, July 1, 2011.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br><br>(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and<br><br>(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br><br>(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br>(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br><br>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br><br>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br><br>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br><br>(ii) Examples. <br><br>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br><br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br><br>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)<br><br>(1) Listed End Product<br>	Listed End Product	 	Listed Countries of Origin:<br> 		 	<br> 		 	<br> 		 	<br><br>(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)  (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)<br><br>(  ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror (  ) does (  ) does not certify that--<br><br>(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br><br>(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br><br>(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br><br>(  ) (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

     (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
 
   (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
 
   (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
 
   (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
 
   (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 
     (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
 
     (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
 
         (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
 
         (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
 
         (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
 
       (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
 
     (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
 
     (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
 
     (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
 
   (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
 
   (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. The evaluation process will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106 using the following process. The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate approximately 2-3 of the lowest priced quotes for technical acceptability, if applicable, and price reasonableness starting with the lowest priced offer. If none of the three lowest priced offers are found to be acceptable, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated, and the process will continue until 2 or more offers are found to be technically acceptable. If after reviewing all offers, only one is found to be technically acceptable, the Contracting Officer&nbsp;may be required to ask the offeror to supply more information to make a price fair and reasonable determination. Offers will receive a technical rating of either acceptable or non-acceptable. <br />Step 3. Assess performance confidence for 2-3 of the lowest priced technically acceptable offerors utilizing performance information provided by the contractor, performance questionnaires, PPRIRS, or any other reasonable basis. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances contracts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. <br /><br />d. A technical review will be accomplished on all offer: a) to ensure offered product meets all product specifications and requirements of the solicitation b) to ensure products will meet the compatibility needs of the governments, and c) to assess quality of offered products. Offers will receive a technical rating of either ACCEPTABLE or NON-ACCEPTABLE.</p>
<p>e. The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>f. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>k. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest of the government. <br />(End of Addendum)</p>

<p>***********************<br /><br />The purpose of this amendment is to respond to a question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTION AND ANSWER</p>
<p><br />Q1) In amendment #2 it states that the minimum for the Solid State Drive is to be 40GB. Typically the Auto grade/mobile grade Standard Hard Drives come in 40/80/100GB increments while the Industrial Grade Solid State Drives are available in 32/64/128GB increments. How should I address this?</p>
<p><br />A1) The RFQ called for a removable solid state hard drive with a minimum of 40 GB and therefore the auto grade/mobile grade solid state standard would meet the requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Vendor shall acknowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted</p>

<p><br />********************<br />The purpose of this amendment is to correct the answer to the Amendment #3 question and to clarify a technical specification based on the response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QUESTION AND ANSWER</p>

Typically the Auto grade/mobile grade Standard Hard Drives come in 40/80/100GB increments while the Industrial Grade Solid State Drives are available in 32/64/128GB increments. How should I address this?</p>
<p><br />A1R) The RFQ called for a removable solid state hard drive; therefore, the industrial grade solid state drive would be required, not the auto grade/mobile grade standard drive. The government is revising the specification to require a removable solid state hard drive with a minimum of 32 GB.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLARIFICATION TO SPECIFICATION</p>

<DESC>HOTEL, DINING, AND AUDIO/VISUAL EVENT PRODUCTION<br />SBA 2011 Field Management Conference<br />PROPOSED DATES ARE FIRM FOR THE PERIOD SUNDAY, JULY 17, 2011 THROUGH FRIDAY, JULY 22, 2011
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The NAICS is 721110 and the Small Business Size Standard is $30.0 million.</p>
<p>A. IDENTIFICATION<br />The Small Business Administration, Field Operations Headquarters intends to block single occupancy sleeping rooms, meeting space, meals, and audio/visual (A/V) event production services for general session presentations for SBA's District Directors, Regional Administrators and supervisors and senior leaders from headquarters.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVES<br />The long-term strength of our agency is critically linked to our ability to align our program or individual office goals with the strategic goals of the SBA. For an organization of our size, our managers and frontline leaders must work in concert and not cross-purposes. We've already begun this process by having our frontline leaders work collaboratively with their program department counterparts to identify critical skills and develop training materials that are relevant for both sides. We'd like to build on that momentum by utilizing our time in Tampa/St. Petersburg, Florida to gain a shared understanding of SBA's strategic plan and how our 2012 district office and program department goals will be informed by the plan.</p>
<p>The goals of the conference are:</p>
<p>1. To identify, share and begin to implement customer service best practices across the agency.<br />2. To examine and identify the customer and partner experience with the agency's programs and services.<br />3. Identify ways to strengthen our customer service while managing performance across all of our field management units.</p>
<p>C. BACKGROUND<br />The SBA Field Management Conference is aimed at SBA's District Directors, Regional Administrators and supervisors and senior leaders from headquarters. The conference will consist of a series of lectures, presentations, training sessions, interactive breakout sessions, and sharing of ideas, best practices and lessons learned.</p>
<p>A small preparatory group will arrive on Sunday, July 17th. They will need to have a pre-conference meeting with the facility staff and a tour of the facility on the morning of Monday, July 18th. The remaining large contingent of the conference attendees will arrive throughout the day of Monday, July 18th. Attendees will be arriving from the entire United States.</p>
<p>Hotel staff will have conference rooms and all hotel provided equipment setup no later than 7:00 am each morning of the training event as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. This includes any hotel provided audio-visual equipment.</p>
<p>On the first day of the training event, the hotel's audio-visual technician will be available from 7:00 am to 9:00 am to assist SBA's presenters with their personal audio-visual equipment setup. Actual start time may change based on final training schedule. SBA's on-site representative will confirm actual day and time audio-visual technician is needed. On-site technical support expertise in audio-visual equipment setup and trouble-shooting necessary to resolve routine audio-visual malfunctions is required. Daily, during the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, hotel's audio-visual staff must be available to provide technical support within 30 minutes of the hotel being notified by SBA's presenters or on-site representative.</p>
<p>SBA's lead contact and on-site representative for all training events is Ms. Susan Nassaux, Field Operations Specialist. Ms. Nassaux may provide additional SBA on-site representatives who may be serving as alternate Agency on-site representatives for specific training events during the performance period.</p>
<p>D. HOTEL LOCATION, QUALITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS<br />The conference space will be used as a training classroom. This will require one large banquet room with unobstructed interior views large enough for various training room configurations/setups (classroom, U-shape, circles, etc) to comfortably accommodate approximately 150 participants. Likewise, SBA may need four smaller work rooms to comfortably accommodate approximately 15-20 participants. At a minimum, all rooms must be Internet accessible and may require standard audio-visual presentation equipment (LCD projectors, microphones/lavalieres, projector screen (or 60" or larger LED/LCD/HD TV screen), connection cables, power cords) technical support and setup available for training presenters. Conference rooms and audio-visual equipment must be reserved solely for SBA for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>In order to meet SBA requirements, all conference and meeting spaces must be contiguous or in very close proximity (line of sight preferred) to each other. The banquet room space, where the General Sessions will be held will be the main focus of the conference; therefore, the space shall be visually appealing. The banquet rooms space shall comfortably accommodate up to 150 adults. The four meeting rooms shall be required to comfortably accommodate 20 adults for smaller work-related meetings. All program space must be blocked for the sole use of SBA for the duration of the conference. Spaces shall be clean, well ventilated, well lit, adequately soundproofed and handicapped accessible.</p>
<p>Guest rooms will be individually occupied. All must have flat screen TVs, included Internet access, and be contemporary, handicapped accessible, and able to offer refrigerators upon request. Guest rooms must be provided at a rate at or below the Government approved rate of $92/night. A list of attendees will be provided at the time of contract award to create the reservations. The entire event including guest rooms will be contracted and invoiced against as a single contract. Attendees will furnish a credit card at check-in for incidentals and personal expenses only. One upgraded guest room is requested to be provided at the Government approved rate of $92/night and must be large enough to accommodate small informal meetings of 10-12 people. The total estimated number of guest rooms needed per night is:</p>
<p><br />DATE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # OF ROOMS<br />17-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25<br />18-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150<br />19-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150<br />20-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150<br />21-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150<br />22-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Departure</p>
<p>The hotel shall guarantee SBA participants' guest room reservations and rates for five business days prior to scheduled event.</p>
<p>Due to the Agency's mission to be able to provide immediate support to America's small business community on a moment's notice, SBA requires flexibility in its ability to change the number of participants' guest rooms reserved. SBA will guarantee 85% occupancy rate of its participants' guest room without penalty.</p>
<p>Hotel on-site parking available to accommodate 20 participants' vehicles at no additional charge.</p>
<p>A hotel airport shuttle service is preferred; however if no shuttle service is provided, the hotel will provide information on other airport transportation options.</p>
<p>Food and beverage service must meet Federal Government's per diem rates. Presentation of food should be visually appealing, colorful, and offer a good variety of nutritional value and selection at each meal and snack. Government meals for breakfast, lunch and breaks are directed and provided to all SBA employees during the training events. Employees' meal per diem allowance will be reduced for all government provided meals. All meals/food/beverage costs are not to exceed the federal governments'&nbsp;Tampa/St Petersburg&nbsp;per diem rates ($8-$10 - breakfast, $12-$15 - lunch) per day excluding service charges. Meals will be served (either buffet style or plated) at predetermined times as during normal meal hours as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. SBA's training schedule will indicate planned meal hours. SBA's on-site representative will confirm meal plan hour with hotel's representative at least one week prior to training start date. However, due to the nature of training, the parties anticipate the need to have some reasonable flexibility in actual meal schedules as not to disrupt the training.</p>
<p>Fast and easy check-in and check-out capabilities are required. With 150 conference attendees arriving at the property at one time, hotel must have a plan/staff to have check-in/check-out move quickly and efficiently. Luggage storage is required if guestrooms are not available for early check-in (11:00 am arrival). The hotel shall allow confirmed guest reservations to arrive up until 11:00 pm of the first day. SBA may require the front desk to hand out an informational welcome flyer to the attendees upon check-in. Express check-out via guestroom TV or under guestroom door invoicing is desired.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, hotel will provide SBA's on-site representatives a telephone directory of "key" hotel personnel assigned to supporting SBA during the conference. The telephone directory must include "key" personnel's business hours and telephone numbers (note a telephone answering service is not acceptable). At a minimum, the key personnel must be identified for check-in/out, guest room accommodations, audio-visual support, meal services, and conference room setup.</p>
<p>The front desk shall be prepared to provide basic information on the proximity of outside dining establishments as the group will likely be released nightly to enjoy dinner outside of the event facility.</p>

<p>If needed, the Government intends to exercise the option or options under FAR 52.217-8 without further competition or need for justification for other than full or open competition [or limited source justification or sole source justification]. For purposes of evaluation, the potential need to exercise the option under FAR 52.217-8 to extend the period of contract performance for the maximum period of six (6) months beyond the last option period will be considered the same for all offerors. In considering the price of the base period and any option periods, the Government will consider that if the extension of service clause (FAR 52.217-8) is exercised, it will be on the exact same rates and terms, other than length of performance, as the base or option period being extended. The Government will determine whether the price, inclusive of all options (including the options available under FAR 52.217-8), is fair and reasonable, and whether the price of the base period and all option periods (including the option(s) represented by FAR 52.217-8), in combination with the other evaluation factors specified in the solicitation, represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number; <br />(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; <br />(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; <br />(4) Terms of any express warranty; <br />(5) Price and any discount terms; <br />(6) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address; <br />(7) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); <br />(08) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; <br />(09) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. <br />(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. <br />(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. <br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. <br />(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. <br />(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- <br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or <br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or <br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. <br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. <br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. <br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. <br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation. <br />(1)(i) The GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR Part 101-29, and copies of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained for a fee by submitting a request to- <br />GSA Federal Supply Service Specifications Section<br />Suite 8100<br />470 East L'Enfant Plaza, SW<br />Washington, DC 20407 <br />Telephone (202) 619-8925<br />Facsimile (202) 619-8978. <br />(ii) If the General Services Administration, Department of Agriculture, or Department of Veterans Affairs issued this solicitation, a single copy of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained free of charge by submitting a request to the addressee in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this provision.

(Applies to all offers exceeding $3,000, and offers of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS+4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS+4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address. The DUNS+4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the offeror to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform.

The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. <br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: <br />(1) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. <br />(2) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. <br />(3) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. <br />(4) A summary of the rationale for award; <br />(5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. <br />(6) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. <br />(End of provision) <br />52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>A. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors' initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>B. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1: Technical Approach - Offeror will be evaluated based upon the demonstrated ability to effectively and efficiently perform the work specified in the statement of work. The approach must demonstrate how each task in the statement of work will be accomplished. This includes information on how the work will be organized and the capability of the offeror. The approach should reflect a clear understanding of the work under this requirement.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2: Personnel- Demonstrated experience, capability and availability of all proposed key personnel, including any consultants or subcontractors.</p>
<p>FACTOR 3: Past Performance: The offeror's demonstrated record, as confirmed by references, of successful past performance of the same or substantially similar contract efforts including quality of services or supplies, timeliness of performance and delivery, cost control and the offeror's business relations.</p>
<p>If an offeror does not have any relevant past performance, the past performance rating will be neutral.</p>
<p>Sources (i.e. Government databases or other individuals) other than those identified in the offeror's proposal may be contacted/accessed by the Government. The Government may use the additional information received in its evaluation of the offeror's past performance and responsibility determination.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than the cost or price. Although the proposed cost or price is not listed as an evaluation factor, it shall be considered a significant criterion in the overall evaluation of proposals. The factors listed above are in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>C. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>If needed, the Government intends to exercise the option or options under FAR 52.217-8 without further competition or need for justification for other than full or open competition [or limited source justification or sole source justification]. For purposes of evaluation, the potential need to exercise the option under FAR 52.217-8 to extend the period of contract performance for the maximum period of six (6) months beyond the last option period will be considered the same for all offerors. In considering the price of the base period and any option periods, the Government will consider that if the extension of service clause (FAR 52.217-8) is exercised, it will be on the exact same rates and terms, other than length of performance, as the base or option period being extended. The Government will determine whether the price, inclusive of all options (including the options available under FAR 52.217-8), is fair and reasonable, and whether the price of the base period and all option periods (including the option(s) represented by FAR 52.217-8), in combination with the other evaluation factors specified in the solicitation, represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>D. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the requirement for the EMD phase of the GMLRS AW program. This requirement is for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) of a Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) rocket. This EMD effort will focus on design refinement, component testing and system level flight testing and qualifications. The period of performance is for 36 months (FY 12-FY15) after contract award.  This requirement is restricted to Lockheed Martin Corporation, Missiles and Fire Control-Dallas (LMMFC-D), P.O. Box 65003, Dallas, Texas 75265, because LMMFC-D is the only contractor with the knowledge, experience, capability, technical expertise, and facilities to produce GMLRS rockets. LMMFC-D will integrate the warhead into the existing GMLRS rocket. LMMFC-D will award a subcontract to a competitively selected, Government directed subcontractor for the further development of the alterative warhead for EMD phase of the program. <br><br>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by this agency.<br><br>

The award for Portion #1 will be made before the award for Portion #2 and award for Portion #2 will be made before the award for Portion #3.

Orders will be issued under each separate contract in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract and without notice to, or consideration of, any other contractor, or consideration of the terms and conditions of any other contract.</p>

Vendor Questions and Government Responses

Q1.  I am having difficulty accessing the SOW, Number D11PS19031,  as referenced in the above eBuy RFQ at the URL http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/Business/solic_details.aspx?solid=429. The IE error states the file is either unavailable or cannot be found.  Would it be possible to forward a copy to me?
A1.  Please insert an underscore between "solic and details" in the web address: http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/Business/solic_details.aspx?solid=429

Q2.  I came across your RFI in FBO and am interested in participating in the process. The December 17, 2010 SOW mentioned below seem to be missing in the FBO website. Is there another way for me to receive a copy of it for review?
A2.  The SOW can be accessed through GSA Advantage / eBuy or via the AQD website address: http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/Business/solic_details.aspx?solid=429.

Q3. In reference to  Solicitation Number D11PS19031, Program Management Office Assistance, the solicitation references an attached draft Statement of Work dated December 17, 2010 but the attachment was apparently not included.  Could you provide the attachment via e-mail?
A3.  Amended RFI with correct web address for SOW posted on 05/12/2011.

Q4.  I was wondering whether this SOW can be responded by any organization? Or is this only applicable to current support vendors?  Please advise.
A4.  The RFI announcement is intended for market research purposes only, see FAR Part 10, Market Research, in order to see what capable sources are available within the marketplace, open market or established sources, i.e. GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS).  Please read the RFI in its entirety, click on the inserted link for access to the Statement of Work, and respond accordingly.

Q5.  [Our company] would like to respond to this solicitation; we have a few questions for our preparations. I was only able to find the SOW on the AQD website; is there an RFQ/RFP?
A5.  Please read the entire RFI.  The RFI announcement is intended for market research purposes only, (see FAR Part 10, Market Research).  Specifically, paragraph 2 of the RFI which states:
"This RFI is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein."
The results of the RFI will help the Government make a determination regarding the most appropriate acquisition strategy for this effort.  Therefore, at this phase of the process there is not an RFQ or RFP since, as stated in the RFI, the Government is not soliciting quotes or proposals.

Q6.  The capability statement requested in the RFI is limited to no more than 10 pages.  The SOW document talks about resumes to substantiate the offerors ability to fulfill tasks.  Please clarify whether resumes ARE or ARE NOT required as a part of the capability statement response.
A6.  Resumes are NOT required with the capability statement submission.

Q7.  What is the purpose of you using eBuy to inquire about sources?  Are you planning to do a set aside?  If not, I don't understand why you are using eBuy for such inquiries?  Please advise.  I am interested in a set-aside, otherwise, what is the purpose of this?
A7.  The RFI announcement is intended for market research purposes only (see FAR Part 10, Market Research) in order to see what capable sources are available within the marketplace, open market or established sources, i.e. GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS).  Therefore, the RFI was issued on both the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) site and the GSA FSS site, eBuy.  The results of the RFI will help the Government make a determination regarding the most appropriate acquisition strategy for this effort.  This would include any determination regarding acquisition strategy such as commercial open market, GSA FSS, set-aside, etc.  Please refer to the RFI for additional information and instructions regarding submission of capability statements.

Q8.  The paragraph below listed in your request states that there is an " attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) dated December 17, 2010. "   We're unable to locate the attachment to the request and wondered how we could secure this information?
A8.  Please visit: http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/Business/solic_details.aspx?solid=429.

Q18.  Small Business set-aside - is there the "potential" if enough skilled & experienced SB's respond to the RFI to have this an SB set-aside? 
A18.  The RFI announcement is intended for market research purposes only in order to see what capable sources are available within the marketplace, open market or established sources, i.e. GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS).  The results of the RFI will help the Government make a determination regarding the most appropriate acquisition strategy for this effort.  This would include any determination regarding acquisition strategy such as commercial open market, GSA FSS, set-aside, etc.  
If the determination is made that the best strategy would be open market and there is reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery, the Government may consider conducting this acquisition as a set-aside.  However, if the determination is made to conduct this acquisition in accordance with FAR 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules, the FAR Part 19 does not apply (see FAR 8.404).

A20.  Potential offerors are instructed to contact only the contracting point of contact identified for any information.  Prospective offerors are cautioned against contacting government technical personnel in regard to this RFI or any request for quote/solicitation prior to potential award for this acquisition.  If such a contact occurs and is found to be prejudicial to potential competing offerors, the offeror making such a contact may be excluded from any further consideration.  Accordingly, all communications must be directed to the contracting point of contact.

Q21.  I am hoping you can confirm if this is a new requirement or if an incumbent already exists. If an incumbent is performing the work I am trying to obtain the incumbent awardee, contract number, incumbent award date and value.
A21.  This information is provided above.  See Answers A10, A11, A12, and A17.

Q22.  Is there an incumbent contractor performing the work outlined in the SOW of dated December 17, 2010 and titled "Statement of Work (SOW) for "Program Management Office Assistance"?  If so, what company has this contract?
A22.  This information is provided above.  See Answer A10. 

Q23.  What is the period of performance and dollar value for this contract?
A23.  This information is provided above.  See Answer A13 and Answer A17.

Q24.  Is the FBMS systems integrator conflicted out of bidding on US Department of Interior's Pre- Solicitation Notice number D11PS19031 - Program Management Office Assistance.
A24.  The Government does not see any conflict or potential for a conflict of interest regarding this acquisition and the current FBMS systems integrator at this time.

Is the current FBMS Independent Verification and Validation contractor conflicted out of bidding on this opportunity?

Range of Magnitude: between $25,000.000 and $100,000,000. 

Period of Performance: 2 years after date of award. 

Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:
a.) The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.
b.) The complexity of the project.
c.) Shortage of skilled labor in the region.
d.) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.
e.) The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.
f.) The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.
g.) The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.
h.) Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.
PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C.
 158(f).
Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy:
a.) Project Labor Agreement,(PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.
b.) An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:
1.) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health.
 Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...
2.) Be consistent with law.
Reference Provision: 52.222-23 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreements.
In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:
a.) Should PLA's be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, Florida area? What other factors should NAVFAC-SE consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a NAVFAC-SE contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?
b.) Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?
c.) Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?
d.) Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?
e.) Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades.
 Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade? 
f.) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.
g.) Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?
h.) Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the NAS Pensacola, FL area?
i.) Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential offerors and/or subcontractors to meet the Small Business utilization goals?

<p>SUBJECT LINE: NOTICE IF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER FOR PBX MAINTENANCE</p>
<p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b) (1) with Advanced Telecommunications Inc, (ATI) for PBX maintenance. The period of performance for this proposed acquisition is 12 months from&nbsp;August 15, 2011 through August 14, 2012, with four one-year options to extend the term the contract; beginning&nbsp;August 15, 2012. Based on NRC's market research, it is imperative that ATI provide the continued maintenance of the proprietary software of the Avaya system in order to provide continuity through the completion of the installation and follow up service. However, any responsible sources that can demonstrate that they, too, can provide the required maintenance may respond to this notice to so indicate. Any such response to this notice must be in writing and must include clear and convincing evidence of that capability to provide the required renewal, including any written authorization from ATI. Written responses must be submitted to wanda.brown@nrc.gov so that it is received at that email address no later than June 27, 2011. A determination whether to compete this requirement will be based on whether other responsible, authorized sources are identified as a result of this notice. Questions may be submitted to Ms. Brown via email at wanda.brown@nrc.gov. No solicitation document is currently available</p>

The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is approximately 241,100 hours. The Contractor shall be required to provide services that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel; dependents; property; destruction of assets; prevent unauthorized access; and, deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. The Government plans to post the solicitation on this site mid-June 2011. No paper copies will be mailed. The Government will solicit this requirement for full and open competition, using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis has been posted for far longer than the minimum&nbsp;15 days required.

<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</strong><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />DoD is developing a Terminal &amp; Networking Roadmap (TNR) that engages with the DoD Laboratories to identify future technology insertion opportunities, that solicits gaps and issues from the Operational Community to determine communications needs as captured in DoD Roadmaps/Visions (i.e. Air Force 2020 Vision), and that discovers emerging technologies within Industry developed through research and development (R&amp;D) or from leveraging existing commercial IT advancements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TNR will <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>provide decision makers with an enterprise level "strategic view" that lays out a timeline for making key decisions about terminal and networking technologies and defines the data required to make those decisions.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;MILSATCOM is a vital piece of the DoD communications architecture as it provides the space-based network connectivity needed to deliver global communications to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>tactical national security operations in areas that lack terrestrial infrastructure, as well as to mobile platforms. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The TNR will help decision makers within the DoD to examine all current, evolving, and futuristic ground networking infrastructure, and terminal architecture technologies that will be available in the 2020 to 2030 timeframe. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This examination will allow the DoD to take advantage of these capabilities and move forward on a path towards developing mitigation strategies for existing capability/requirement gaps and threats. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>With the current cancellation of the TSAT program, the role of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) constellations is anticipated to expand to fill MILSATCOM capability and functionality gaps. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>DoD also turns to commercial SATCOM (COMSATCOM) assets to fill in essential bandwidth gaps, and appears willing to continue exploring SATCOM options such as leased capability and hosted payloads in the future.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><br />The operational requirements of the MILSATCOM terminal architecture are moving towards full functionality across multiple frequency bands and communication protocols. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>As such, future MILSATCOM architecture components (terminals, systems, ground infrastructure, etc.) should be designed with both the flexibility and adaptability to operate across different MILSATCOM satellite systems and communications layers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Commonality at the component level would increase terminal affordability and interoperability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order for DoD to maximize the use of its existing SATCOM resources while leveraging new technologies, joint service collaboration and planning must be a part of a forward-moving strategy that focuses on; increased terminal capabilities, affordability, a unified approach to network management and connectivity, and decreased IA vulnerabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><br />The path to develop enhanced satellite terminals is challenging because many of the legacy satellite terminals and associated satellite systems were designed to function as independent systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Integrating these legacy systems with new technologies to meet DoD demands for a more interoperable, integrated SATCOM architecture is a huge challenge. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>An integral piece of this new architecture is the interoperability of the space, aerial, and terrestrial communications layers. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Changes in SATCOM demand (increased AISR and Communications On The Move (COTM), for example) within this integrated architecture require us to leverage legacy assets while exploring new technologies, incorporating a mix of SATCOM options to successfully meet the warfighter's operational requirements.</p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</strong><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />DoD is developing a Terminal &amp; Networking Roadmap (TNR) that engages with the DoD Laboratories to identify future technology insertion opportunities, that solicits gaps and issues from the Operational Community to determine communications needs as captured in DoD Roadmaps/Visions (i.e. Air Force 2020 Vision), and that discovers emerging technologies within Industry developed through research and development (R&amp;D) or from leveraging existing commercial IT advancements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TNR will <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>provide decision makers with an enterprise level "strategic view" that lays out a timeline for making key decisions about terminal and networking technologies and defines the data required to make those decisions.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;MILSATCOM is a vital piece of the DoD communications architecture as it provides the space-based network connectivity needed to deliver global communications to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>tactical national security operations in areas that lack terrestrial infrastructure, as well as to mobile platforms. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The TNR will help decision makers within the DoD to examine all current, evolving, and futuristic ground networking infrastructure, and terminal architecture technologies that will be available in the 2020 to 2030 timeframe. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This examination will allow the DoD to take advantage of these capabilities and move forward on a path towards developing mitigation strategies for existing capability/requirement gaps and threats. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>With the current cancellation of the TSAT program, the role of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) constellations is anticipated to expand to fill MILSATCOM capability and functionality gaps. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>DoD also turns to commercial SATCOM (COMSATCOM) assets to fill in essential bandwidth gaps, and appears willing to continue exploring SATCOM options such as leased capability and hosted payloads in the future.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><br />The operational requirements of the MILSATCOM terminal architecture are moving towards full functionality across multiple frequency bands and communication protocols. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>As such, future MILSATCOM architecture components (terminals, systems, ground infrastructure, etc.) should be designed with both the flexibility and adaptability to operate across different MILSATCOM satellite systems and communications layers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Commonality at the component level would increase terminal affordability and interoperability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order for DoD to maximize the use of its existing SATCOM resources while leveraging new technologies, joint service collaboration and planning must be a part of a forward-moving strategy that focuses on; increased terminal capabilities, affordability, a unified approach to network management and connectivity, and decreased IA vulnerabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><br />The path to develop enhanced satellite terminals is challenging because many of the legacy satellite terminals and associated satellite systems were designed to function as independent systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Integrating these legacy systems with new technologies to meet DoD demands for a more interoperable, integrated SATCOM architecture is a huge challenge. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>An integral piece of this new architecture is the interoperability of the space, aerial, and terrestrial communications layers. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Changes in SATCOM demand (increased AISR and Communications On The Move (COTM), for example) within this integrated architecture require us to leverage legacy assets while exploring new technologies, incorporating a mix of SATCOM options to successfully meet the warfighter's operational requirements.</p>

<a href="mailto:Freddie.Beaulieux@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>1.  The solicitation's for both the Standard and Compact Model requires  "Vehicle Securement Points (to stabilize device in vehicle)".  This infers that the device will not be occupied by the user while being transported and that the securement points are intended to only secure the device while in transit.  Yet the standard referenced in the description (April 2000 Supplement to ANSI/RESNA WC/Vol. 1 - 1998) is a test standard that only tests the device while occupied by a user.  The requirement and the referenced standard seem to be contradictory.  So, is the requirement intended to be:
   A.  Provide securement points to stablize the device in a vehicle without an occupant seated in the device (which is inferred by the requirement)? or
   B.  Provide transit tie-down brackets that are intended to secure both the device and the occupant while being transported in a vehicle (which is inferred by the standard used)?
2.  If the answer above is A, then which standard shall be the referenced test standard?  We are not aware of a standard that tests unoccupied devices while being transported.  Or, if the answer above is B, we are concerned that this may limit the pool of prospective products since, as is listed on the RERC on Transit web-site(http://www.rercwts.org/RERC_WTS2_KT/RERC_WTS2_KT_Stand/RERC_WTS2_19_Chart.html), there are, to the best of our knowledge, no power wheelchairs with Captains style seats that meet the specified test standard.
3.  In the Required Options portion of the solicitation, a requirement for "Back Support" is listed with the description of "Back Cane pair adjustable over 3" span".  It is unclear as to what the purpose of the back canes are.  Are the back canes intended to provide a mounting location for a custom backrest other than the Captains style backrest specified as the required option backsupport, or are the back canes intended to provide an attendent with push handles that operate in conjuction with the Captains style backrest specified as a required option?  Secondly, the "adjustable over 3" span" is unclear.  Is the 3" of adjustment intended to be a height adjustment of the back canes or a lateral adjustment?  Finally, if the adjustment is a lateral one, does each cane need to adjust a total of 3", or  does the combined width between the two canes need to be adjustable by a total of 3"?

Proposals that are considered substantively incomplete after initial screening shall be rejected and offerors will be notified they are no longer eligible for further consideration.

Additionally, a proposal that is unreasonable or incomplete in terms of price will not be considered for award.<br><br>3. The Government intends to award without discussions. Offerors shall ensure their initial proposal contains its best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary.

Under Mission Capability the following elements will be evaluated: Expert knowledge of JEFTS/ECS2 systems and the timeline for completion of tasks 1-7. These elements will be evaluated together for acceptability in the Mission Capability area. The Mission Capability factor will receive one of the following adjectival ratings:<br><br>ACCEPTABLE - Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation (See Note below).<br><br>UNACCEPTABLE - Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br><br>NOTE: Expert knowledge of JFETS/ECS2 systems will be a key factor in the selection consideration process. A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in this area will NOT be eligible for award.<br><br>2. Past Performance. Under Past Performance the following elements will be evaluated: Experience working in JFETS/ECS2 environment. The Past Performance Factor will receive one of the adjectival ratings:<br><br>ACCEPTABLE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown (See Note below). <br><br>UNACCEPTABLE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br><br>NOTE: No record of past performance will result in an acceptable rating. Offerors shall submit only past performance relevant to the requirements set forth in this solicitation. A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in this area will NOT be eligible for award. <br><br>3. Price. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness IAW FAR 15.403-1(c)(1).

<p>The contractor shall provide technical assistance in evaluating License Amendment Requests (LARs) related to transition to the new risk-informed fire protection licensing basis (NFPA 805 Rule) or Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 50.48(c), NFPA 805, "Performance-Based Standard for Fire Protection for Light Water Reactor Electric Generating Plants," 2001 Edition. The objective of this contract is to obtain fire protection, fire probabilistic risk assessment and regulatory expertise from the contractor, on a task ordering basis, to assist the staff in determining the safety adequacy of the NFPA 805 LARs consistent with the Standard Review Plan (NUREG-0800, Section 9.5.1.2) and in accordance with the rule language in Section 10 CFR 50.48(c)(3)(i).</p>
<br />This procurement was a non-competitive action under FAR Part 6.302-3.&nbsp; A cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract was suitable in this instance due to uncertainties involved in contract perfomance that do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.<br /><br />
