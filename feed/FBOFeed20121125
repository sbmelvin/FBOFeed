Technical acceptability is met when the offeror submits proof of technical descriptions/information as stated above and compliance with the delivery requirement.</p>
<p>(iii) If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical capability as defined in above paragraph (a)2, this will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptable capability, the Government will then go to the next low offeror in the same manner if they meet the technical capability. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical acceptable capability in ascending order of the low price.</p>

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
