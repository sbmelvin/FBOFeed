<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The solicitation will consist of a base and four option periods, with the base period covering October 1, 2013 thru September 30, 2014.  Each option period should increase in price by no more than 2.5% due to inflation.  For this effort, the government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price contract for the required services.

The functionality of the Radio Communications System at the Natchez Trace Parkway is critical in the performance of the mission and the operation of the Parkway.  The system is primarily used by Ranger Law Enforcement Officers spread out over 444-miles of Parkway, and also serves as the main command and control tool for senior Park managers in directing resources where life safety issues may be at stake.
This notice is not the solicitation, the solicitation will be posted on or about June 22, 2013, with Request for Proposals due on July 22, 2013.
