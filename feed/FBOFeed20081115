<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  This is not a solicitation request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this notice.  There will not be a solicitation, specifications or drawings available at this time.
Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC MIDLANT) is seeking  Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUBZone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel and capability to perform the proposed contracts.  
NAVFAC MIDLANT anticipates awarding a Multiple Award Contract(s) for Remedial Action Construction (RAC), Remedial Action Operations (RAO), and Long Term Management (LTM) for projects within the Hampton Roads Integrated Product Team (HRIPT) Area of Responsibility (AOR), located in the State of VA.  The AOR for this requirement include the cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg, and Yorktown.    The contract will be awarded to a maximum of five (5) contractors.  The contract will be for a five year duration:  base year plus four option years, with an estimated contract value of $50,000,000.
General Work Requirements:  
The Contractor shall provide the personnel, tools, equipment, materials, transportation, and management to perform Remedial Action Construction, Remedial Action Operations, and/or Long Term Management services as required and negotiated in each individual task order.  
Remedial Action Construction (RAC) is the phase of the CERCLA process where the site remedy is constructed either as an interim or final action.  This phase may include the construction of various soil, sediment and/or groundwater remediation systems that function as containment (e.g. soil cover, RCRA cap, slurry wall, pump & treat systems); in-situ treatment (e.g.natural attenuation, soil vapor extraction, enhanced bio-remediation, air sparging) or ex-situ treatment (air stripping, constructed wetlands, off site disposal, stabilization, solidification).
Remedial Action Operations (RAO) is the phase of the CERCLA process when the remediation system (possibly constructed under the RAC phase noted above) is in place and is operating, or the chemical or biological processes are occurring leading to the cleanup objective. RAO may include active remediation, monitoring, operation, and optimization for extended periods of time to reduce contaminants to site cleanup standards; along with implementation & management/maintenance of Land Use Controls (LUCs).  
Long Term Management (LTM) occurs when the selected remedy has achieved the cleanup goals (possibly done under the RAC or RAO phase noted above), and hazardous substances remain at the site above levels that would allow unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. LTM  may include long term monitoring, implementation and/or management of land use controls (LUCs), maintenance of the final remedy, and preparation of five year reviews. 
In addition to performance of the specific services listed above, the contractor will generally be responsible for maintaining records and preparation of written documents such as Operations and Maintenance (O&M) plan modifications, work plans, health & safety plans, sampling and analysis plans (SAP), and waste management plans connected with such services.  The contractor may also be required to provide proposed solutions to technical problems and optimization.  The work also includes performing indefinite quantity work such as maintenance, repair, and /or construction directed by the Contracting Officer via issued Task Orders.

Proposed Contract Task Order (CTO) ordering procedures:  
Each CTO will be initially awarded on a "fair opportunity" basis as outlined in FAR 16.505.  Because the initial contracts will be awarded through a rigorous Best Value Source Selection (BVSS) process, we intend to make maximum use of the latitude allowed by the FAR to streamline CTO awards.  Typically, only price and past performance will be considered.  When required, we will maintain the ability to employ more rigorous evaluation criteria for CTO awards.
Follow-on CTO's will be ordered as an "exception to the fair opportunity process" as outlined in FAR 16.505.  Because O&M/Long Term Monitoring (LTM) requires consistent management, it would be impractical to re-compete each CTO at its completion.  Each awardee will have a fair opportunity to be considered for the original orders, but, we will attempt to negotiate subsequent follow-on CTO's on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency.  If we are unable to negotiate a fair and reasonable price, we will reserve the right to compete the follow-on work on a "fair opportunity" basis to all contract awardees.
The range for individual task orders $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.
All Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUBZone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to respond.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether an 8(a), HUBZone Small Business or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement.   If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals.
