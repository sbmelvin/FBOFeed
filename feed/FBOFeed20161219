Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice<br />RFP-200-1350-CS
<p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons is seeking concerns having the ability for providing Residential Reentry center (RRC) services (in-house RRC beds) and Home Confinement services (home confinement placements within a 100 mile radius of the RRC) for male Federal offenders held under the authority of United States Statutes located within Farmington, Missouri area, within St. Francois County or Ste. Genevieve County</p>
<p>Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work (SOW) entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, October 2016 (Corrected)" (see attached).

Additional requirements for these services are referenced throughout the SOW as well. This will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract for services with a one-year base period, and four one-year options periods.</p>
<p>The Bureau requires 65 RRC beds and 29 spaces for home confinement. The Bureau will entertain any and all offers proposing a minimum of 65 RRC beds. All proposals must provide for home confinement placements in the amount of 50% of the proposed residential beds. Offers proposing less than 65 RRC beds and/or less than the corresponding home confinement placements will not be considered.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home confinement placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<p>This contract shall acquire the services of a contractor to perform home-based medical evaluations for HANDLS participants who are unable to visit the Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs) for their follow-up medical evaluations. Initially, the Government estimates that <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>it will require 55 home visits per year conducted primarily in the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area, but also in other areas to which participants may have moved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Home visit medical evaluations shall be performed according to the HANDLS timeline specified for participants' scheduled follow-up MRV visits. The first year will also include home visits that are out of sequence (behind the usual scheduled appointment date) because the Government was unable to evaluate the participant on the MRV when initially scheduled.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the contract are to: (1) perform follow-up study evaluations on all home-visit participants identified by the Government; (2) increase the value of the study by reducing the biasing effect of non-random missing data, and (3) expand the collection of biological samples in participants who have developed substantial comorbidity and disability.</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 40.5pt">(a) the plan for recruiting HANDLS participants into the home visit program that maximizes participation, and the plan for training examiners and interviewers;</p>

<DESC>The Professional and Technical (ProTech) services solution is a suite of multiple-award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts consisting of five Domains: Satellite, Ocean, Fisheries, Weather, and Enterprise Operations. These Domains provide resources in support of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to include its Line and Staff Offices. Where applicable, the contracts may also be used by other Bureaus within the Department of Commerce (DOC). The ceiling dollar amount for all orders under all ProTech Domains is $3,000,000,000.
<p>There is one solicitation for each Domain and each solicitation will result in the award of multiple IDIQ contracts for the specific Domain. Here, the resultant IDIQ contracts will provide professional and technical services to the Fisheries Domain (hereafter "ProTech-Fisheries") under NAICS code 541990.</p>
<p>U.S. Fisheries play an important role in the nation's economy providing opportunities for commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing, and sustainable seafood for the nation. Sustainably managed fisheries also contribute to a healthy and resilient ecosystem. NOAA Fisheries is responsible for the stewardship of the nation's ocean resources and their habitat. NOAA Fisheries provides vital services for the nation: productive and sustainable fisheries, safe sources of seafood, the recovery and conservation of protected resources, and healthy ecosystems.</p>
<p>The primary clients of this Domain will be the offices of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries or NMFS).</p>
<p>The Acquisition Strategy: Full and Open Competition with reserves for small business in accordance with section 1331 of the U.S. Jobs Act. The assigned NAICS code for determining status as a small business is 541990 with a size standard of $15M. <br />Presolicitation:</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">The goal of Electronic Warfare (EW) is to control the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) by exploiting, deceiving, or denying enemy use of the spectrum while ensuring its use by friendly forces. To that end, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) EW Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) program invests in Science and Technology (S&amp;T) initiatives that will provide naval forces (including Navy and Marine Corps) with improved threat warning systems; Electronic warfare Support (ES); decoys and countermeasures against weapon tracking and guidance systems; Electronic Attack (EA) against adversary Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Electronic Protection (EP) of our own weapons and C4ISR from intentional and unintentional interference. <br /><br />ONR Code 312 Electronic Warfare (312EW) seeks proposals to develop and demonstrate technologies for the next generation systems in electronic warfare. White papers and subsequent proposals should address technology developments in one or more of the following Research Opportunity Areas 1-5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span></span><br />Area 1 - Subsystem Demonstrator for EO/IR Beam Steering at Multiple Wavelengths</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">The objective is to leverage prior investments by ONR, other Government organizations, industry, and academia in electronic and photonic technologies, techniques, components, devices and subsystems to create subsystem demonstrators (SSDs) of advanced EW capabilities in the RF, mmW and EO/IR portions of the EMS. For the purposes of this BAA, an SSD is defined as an integrated collection of components, devices and subsystems that, in conjunction with other established or developmental technologies and techniques, will demonstrate an end-to-end EW capability in Research Areas 1 &amp; 2. Each SSD will demonstrate both the functional configuration and capability of a final EW subsystem, though not necessarily the physical configuration, packaging, or form factor. White papers and subsequent proposals will encompass not only the development of these SSDs but also a final government-witnessed demonstration in a tactically relevant real or simulated environment. In order to speed the transition of these capabilities to military (Navy, Marine Corps and Joint service) systems, Offerors are encouraged to make use of existing standards for open and modular systems that are either non-proprietary (e.g. VITA, open VPX, etc.) or to which the government has full and open rights. While each SSD description below highlights the need for reducing Size, Weight and Power (SWAP) by design, actual SWAP savings may be demonstrated through analysis rather than physical measurement.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">The objective is to leverage prior investments by ONR, other Government organizations, industry, and academia in electronic and photonic technologies, techniques, components, devices and subsystems to create subsystem demonstrators (SSDs) of advanced EW capabilities in the RF, mmW and EO/IR portions of the EMS. For the purposes of this BAA, an SSD is defined as an integrated collection of components, devices and subsystems that, in conjunction with other established or developmental technologies and techniques, will demonstrate an end-to-end EW capability in Research Areas 1 &amp; 2. Each SSD will demonstrate both the functional configuration and capability of a final EW subsystem, though not necessarily the physical configuration, packaging, or form factor. White papers and subsequent proposals will encompass not only the development of these SSDs but also a final government-witnessed demonstration in a tactically relevant real or simulated environment. In order to speed the transition of these capabilities to military (Navy, Marine Corps and Joint service) systems, Offerors are encouraged to make use of existing standards for open and modular systems that are either non-proprietary (e.g. VITA, open VPX, etc.) or to which the government has full and open rights. While each SSD description below highlights the need for reducing Size, Weight and Power (SWAP) by design, actual SWAP savings may be demonstrated through analysis rather than physical measurement. The SSD shall use technologies that are conducive to minimizing SWAP requirements for future tactical implementation on SWAP-constrained vehicles or platforms.</span></p>

Innovation is expected in which specific capabilities of networked EW substantially exceed that of the individual assets acting alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Proposals for general EW networking "frameworks" in which the benefits are ambiguous or left to future work are not acceptable.</span></p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified business sources. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.

<p>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE</p>
<p>NIST conducts a program aimed at developing standards for quantitative nuclear medicine imaging. One of the cornerstones of this program is a Philips Gemini TF 16-slice PET-CT scanner that was purchased with funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in 2009. The scanner and its associated components are used in the development of National standards and have been thoroughly studied and characterized for this purpose. The system requires an exceptionally high degree of reliability to continue in this capacity.<br />The system suffered a catastrophic failure of the x-ray tube and heat exchanger system in September 2016 and requires replacement of both components. <br />The system was under a comprehensive preventative maintenance and repair plan from the time of installation until April 2015 by the manufacturer. The Government wishes to once again place the system under a maintenance and repair plan following the repairs to the components identified above. <br />The purpose of the first item in this procurement is to repair the PET-CT scanner and return it to previous, normal operating status. The purpose of the second part is to provide a service and repair agreement for the PET-CT scanner installed at NIST to ensure its continued operation. <br />CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS<br />&bull; The repair work must be completed prior to the start of the maintenance program and will consist of diagnosing, replacing, and testing the x-ray tube, heat exchanger, and associated components on the PET-CT scanner.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms); veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses.  This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this sources sought. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC), the Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC) is seeking to identify any sources with capabilities or prior experience that can develop an IT business process management tool to automate Clinical Center administrative workflow processes, in accordance with the following DRAFT Statement of Work.  This is a potential Purchase Order, firm-fixed price award.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:  NIH/CC/OPC wishes to learn about available IT products for a business process management tool to automate administrate workflows that are currently manually intensive.  The objective is to improve processing time and consistency, as well as communication between the users for greater operational efficiencies. This tool will be managed and maintained by the offices within the NIH.</p>
<p>The initial roll-out of the business process management tool will involve using it to automate 1-2 existing processes.  The processes themselves will not require business transformation in advance; instead, they will be automated as-is using the selected tool.  The tool will provide one central IT application that will give access and permissions based on user roles. The application will capture, save, and, track data. It will also provide commenting, reporting, versioning, and searching. Its attributes will include reminder notifications, item/group flagging, and field/form validation.  Subsequent phases will involve implementing the tool for additional processes that can benefit from automation.</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC), the Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC) is seeking to identify any sources with capabilities or prior experience that can develop an IT business process management tool to automate Clinical Center administrative workflow processes, in accordance with the following DRAFT Statement of Work. This is a potential Purchase Order, firm-fixed price award.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: NIH/CC/OPC wishes to learn about available IT products for a business process management tool to automate administrate workflows that are currently manually intensive. The objective is to improve processing time and consistency, as well as communication between the users for greater operational efficiencies. This tool will be managed and maintained by the offices within the NIH.</p>
<p>The initial roll-out of the business process management tool will involve using it to automate 1-2 existing processes. The processes themselves will not require business transformation in advance; instead, they will be automated as-is using the selected tool. The tool will provide one central IT application that will give access and permissions based on user roles. The application will capture, save, and, track data. It will also provide commenting, reporting, versioning, and searching. Its attributes will include reminder notifications, item/group flagging, and field/form validation. Subsequent phases will involve implementing the tool for additional processes that can benefit from automation.</p>

<SUBJECT>Daily Activity Measured with Accelerometry in a clinical trial:  Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Unload the Left ventricle in patients with Advanced heart failure (TAVR UNLOAD) 
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-16-024

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.<br />&nbsp;
<p>BACKGROUND <br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Laboratory of Epidemiology and Populations Studies (LEPS) has a need for a project entitled "Daily Activity Measured with Accelerometry in a clinical trial: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Unload the Left Ventricle Comparing Optimal Heart Failure Therapy to Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Unload the left ventricle in patients with Advanced heart failure" (TAVR UNLOAD). This is a new requirement, nested in a clinical trial in which patients have advanced heart failure and moderate aortic valve disease, and will allow for the comparison of patients with optimal medical therapy versus patients with optimal medical therapy and transcatheter replacement of the aortic valve. TAVR UNLOAD is a new clinical trial funded through the Cardiovascular Research Foundation. The goal of this study is to examine whether replacement of aortic valve in patients with moderate valvular damage aids in the treatment of congestive heart failure when both conditions occur. While the trial is planned with sites in both Europe and the United States, the follow-up for accelerometry determined endpoints will take place in the United States. This is new work that is currently not part of the grant-funded study. <br /><br />The overall goal of this ancillary study is to estimate the change in daily activity over time, comparing patients with aortic valvular disease and congestive heart failure who are randomized, to either optimal therapy for congestive heart disease or to transcatheter replacement of their aortic valve combined with optimal therapy for congestive heart disease. Currently, there are few trials using accelerometry that longitudinally characterize change in daily activity over the course of the trial. The goals of adding an ancillary study with accelerometry are several-fold. First, the ancillary study would provide data regarding the central question of the trial-over the course of the trial, with ascertainment periods at one (1) month, six (6) months, one (1) year, and two (2) years, will daily activity be greater in subjects who have had their valve replaced via a transcatheter approach? Will sleep quality and indicators of circadian rhythm be better preserved in subjects with congestive heart failure who undergo treatment with aortic valve replacement? The repeated objective monitoring data in the trial will provide specific information on change in activity volume, duration, intensity and distribution that also will allow study of hypotheses regarding the natural history of congestive failure and change in function over time as well as change in function and recovery related to TAVR. Lastly, the ancillary study accelerometry data will allow assessment of whether there is utility in inclusion of objective monitoring within clinical trials, given the many other measurements of functional status included in the trial.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The objectives of this requirement are: 1) compare objectively measured daily activity in subjects with optimally treated advanced congestive heart failure who have been randomized TAVR or no TAVR; 2) to quantify the natural history of decline and recovery in objectively measured activity following TAVR in subjects with moderate aortic stenosis with advanced congestive heart failure; 3) to quantify the natural history of the relationship between objectively measured daily activity and congestive heart failure in patients undergoing TAVR; and 4) to quantify natural history of the relationship between objectively measured daily activity and moderate aortic stenosis with advanced congestive heart failure.<br /><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS / SCOPE OF WORK<br />This study calls for performing the following activities for two (2) years:<br />&bull; Defining the study population<br />o As directed by the Government, the resultant Contractor shall share a list of all clinical centers for the trial. Identify high volume centers for recruitment. These high volume centers will be targeted for accelerometry with numbers extending from this base if necessary. <br />&bull; Finalize protocols<br />o A study coordinator for this ancillary study will be identified at each of the study centers. A trainer from LEPS will review the preliminary protocol with these coordinators and will finalize the study protocol based on feedback from the coordinators. As part of that protocol, serial numbers for each accelerometer deployed will be recorded and battery level will be noted.<br />o Actigraph accelerometers will be used over the entire course of the study to assess activity measures including intensity, duration, and distribution. Accelerometers objectively assess activity with minimal burden and good compliance. The monitors will be worn on the wrist during the data collection to enhance acceptability of the protocol.<br />o Participants will be required to complete a log indicating their sleeping and waking times during each period of accelerometry. <br />&bull; Protocol for mailing of accelerometers by participants to the study coordinator<br />o Jointly with LEPS investigators, define a protocol by which accelerometers would be returned to the clinic center by mail, including plans for following up with nonrespondents. <br />&bull; Data management<br />o Provide data collection forms for monitor tracking, refusal tracking, complaint tracking, and relevant medical events. All data from these sources shall be entered into a single database. The resultant Contractor shall institute measures to minimize data entry errors and time spent correcting the data. <br />o Upload the data into the files at the Coordinating Center for the TAVR UNLOAD trial. The Coordinating Center will be responsible for uploading data to the Interdisciplinary Studies of Aging Section of the Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences for analysis. <br />o Raw data from the accelerometers will be uploaded at the clinical sites and sent to the Study Coordinating Center and then to LEPS for processing, transformation, and calculation of standardized variables. The calculated variables will be transmitted back to the TAVR UNLOAD Coordinating Center where they will be joined to the master dataset. <br />o The data management task at the Coordinating Center will consist of downloading data from the accelerometers and securely transferring the data to the NIA LEPS. The data management task will also respond to quality control queries from NIA LEPS and will provide requested clinical data to NIA LEPS. The resultant Contractor shall be responsible for protection of any personally identifiable information (PII) that is obtained from participants. No PII is required in the transfer of accelerometer data to NIA LEPS. De-identified raw data files will reside at the NIA as well as at TAVR UNLOAD Coordinating Center.<br />&bull; Data analysis<br />o The resultant Contractor shall guarantee that data needed for analytic papers to complement the accelerometer files will be available to the NIA LEPS analysis center and colleagues for papers to be written from the data. TAVR UNLOAD investigators and NIA investigators will be included in papers published from this work. All work under this task will follow TAVR UNLOAD and NIA publication principles for submission of written work. <br />o Once data collection is complete, the NIA LEPS will coordinate sharing of the calculated standardized variables from the accelerometry data created at LEPS with the TAVR UNLOAD data center. The resultant Contractor will provide expertise and collaborate in the preparation of all reports and manuscripts.<br />o The resultant Contractor, with LEPS, will conduct hypotheses testing and draft reports or manuscripts with sharing of appropriate data as requested by LEPS. The resultant Contractor will combine accelerometer data with clinical data from the TAVR UNLOAD Study. For this purpose, standard, statistical, and epidemiologic methods will be used.</p>
<p>Reports and deliverables<br />Quarterly Progress Reports to include the description of the work performed during the reporting period&#894; tables for assessment of sample for participants in the study two (2) weeks after study award&#894; finalized questionnaire for administration over the telephone four (4) weeks after study award&#894; monthly transmission of data from de-identified acclerometers with personally identifiable information removed&#894; transmission of de-identified data set for analysis of data to address hypotheses eleven months after study award&#894; and a Final Progress Report to include a summary report on the completion of the study at the end of the contract period will be required.</p>

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) Acquisitions Office intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Becton Dickinson (BD) and Co., Inc., Home Health Division, 220 Lake Drive, Newark, NJ, 19702 for the procurement of cDIFF test kits for use in the UD Medical Center s BD Max Analyzer.

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i) (only 1 responsible source) because the Government believes that Becton Dickinson is the only provider of these test kits that will properly work in the onsite BD Max System Analyzer.  It is believed that without significant recalibration and costly and time-consuming re-benchmarking of patient cDIFF testing parameters, only the BD cDIFF test kits will perform properly and in a clinically acceptable manner.  Additionally, the vendor chosen for this contract will provide Field Service to the BD Max System analyzer and resolve all issues within 24 hours, Mon-Sun.  The contract to be effected is for a base and 4 years beginning 1/01/17.

This notice of intent is not for competitive quotes. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number is 334516, small business size standard of 1000 employees. This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document is available.  However, parties may express their interest accompanied by supporting literature by email to Jeff Greis, Contracting Officer, no later than December 21, 2016, @ 15:01 ET.  Responses should be sent to jeffrey.greis@va.gov.   No telephone responses will be accepted.

HHS/OMHA intends to require brandname equipment and systems installed to interface with the Department and Agency's security system. As such, an approved Justification will be provided for those brandname products and services. There may be other brandname products and services included in the approved justification due to other systems installed within the building (Building automation system, HVAC, Fire/Life/Safety, etc.). Please note that construction and demolition work will require the appropriately licensed and experienced trades to perform the work in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
<p>A draft Project Development Study has been provided for review for those firms interested in participating in the forthcoming solicitation. Interested parties are required to comply with GSA Order 3490.2 regarding safeguard Sensitive but Unclassified building information that will be provided and are required to complete and return an agreement stating the same before access to some of the information is provided.</p>
<p>This project will deliver a fully functional space solution for the TSA at the Seattle International Airport. The design-build contractor will be responsible for design, demolition, construction, with possible moving services. The work will be required to be phased as spaces become available at different dates and times. As such, close coordination will be required with building tenants.&nbsp;Also, there is high probability that there will be no onsite laydown areas other than in the spaces that the work is being performed. The same applies for onsite waste/debris containers as the containers will not be allowed in or around the building due to security reasons. Disposal will need to occur on an as needed basis.</p>

As such, it is requested that you carefully consider the security processing capabilities of your firm&nbsp;and associated subcontractors.

Contractor personnel must be prepared to complete online security questionnaires and obtain fingerprinting at one of the local facilities within the greater Seattle region,</p>
<p>The Contractor will need to closely plan and coordinate with the Government to meet GSA HHS OMHA, requirements for design reviews, material deliveries, and access to high security areas (U.S Marshall's Service, and Federal Courts), utility outages, and other special project related requests. The Contractor will need to closely cooperate and collaborate with the GSA, and HHS OMHA and Construction Management/Commissioning contractor to move the project forward. The expectation is that the Contractor will take the necessary actions to resolve all issues in an expeditious and friendly manner. The Contractor will need to closely manage and coordinate with subcontractors. The contractor's detailed design documents will need to be reviewed by the HHS OMHA and the GSA. The design team must be well versed in all applicable codes and processes, especially local codes and GSA Region 10 requirements.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in order to obtain responses from members of the recycling hauling and processing community, sustainability experts, and other interested parties regarding the expansion of recyclable materials collection and processing in federal facilities located within the National Capital Region (NCR). NCR is defined as the District of Columbia, Montgomery and Prince George's counties in Maryland, and Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William counties in Virginia.  For the purpose of this contract it will cover approximately 126 facilities to be detailed within the scope of work. Materials eventually collected for recycling must be in compliance with all federal, state, and local recycling laws within the NCR.<br />The primary objective of this RFI is to obtain information regarding options for recycling certain items, the cost of hauling and recycling them, and the financial and environmental impact of expanding the recycling program at government-owned and operated facilities in the NCR.   GSA is interested in ideas and options for keeping the maximum amount of our total waste stream out of landfills, reducing waste disposal and recycling costs, and increasing recycling revenues. <br />NOTICE:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued for the purpose of market research only and does not constitute a solicitation. The General Services Administration (GSA) may use the information received to develop a future solicitation but the decision to do so is within its sole discretion. Any information received under this RFI shall become the property of GSA. No response to this RFI shall be construed as a quotation or proposal and respondents are solely responsible for all costs associated with the preparation of any submission.&nbsp;

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in December.   <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br />The Open Period for January is January 1, 2017 to January 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2017 or until it is replaced.
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 17-Reg10 and must be located within Region 10.</p>
<p><br />To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>

The work also includes removing the existing excitation systems for these units and modifying the existing control panels. The new excitation cubicles and power potential transformers shall be designed to occupy the same location as the existing ones. The location of all external connections from the excitation system shall remain the same with limited variations. The contract drawings will note the exceptions. New conductors shall be installed for all the external connections.</p>
<p><strong>Main Unit Exciter Replacement:</strong></p>
<p>NEW ARRANGEMENT, UNIT 1 &amp; 2</p>
<p>The new excitation cubicles and power potential transformers (PPT's) shall be installed in their present locations. The existing Unit 1 &amp; 2 excitation cubicles have single bridges to handle the current. (772A nominal, 915A Max) The "footprint" of the excitation cubicle and PPT is given on the contract drawings. New conductors shall be pulled for all the external excitation system connections through the existing cable tray and conduit system. The new excitation cubicle and PPT shall be mounted per applicable seismic requirements. There may be a need for minor adaptations to cable tray risers and conduit entries to accommodate the new excitation system.</p>
<p>PPT PRIMARY FEED</p>
<p>The existing raceway shall be reused for the PPT primary feed. New conductors and current limiting fuses in the primary terminal chamber of the Unit 1 &amp; 2 PPTs, sized appropriately, will be installed. The location of the taps and connections will remain the same.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Industry Day is to engage industry in an interactive way to gather additional information to support ongoing market research efforts.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, management, facilities, materials, parts, supplies, transportation, and equipment, except as provided herein as Government furnished, to perform all functions for aircraft refuel/defuel for the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE), Fort Rucker, Alabama, its tenant activities, and authorized transient aircraft.

<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for interested potential Offerors to attend an Industry Day hosted by MICC - Fort Eustis to discuss the future DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>MICC - Fort Eustis is conducting additional market research to identify reasonable alternatives that enhance the overall level of competition, expand prime or subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, generate significant cost savings for the Army and/or enhance the Army's ability to plan, manage and execute the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) Fort Rucker aircraft Refuel/Defuel Services contract. The conceptual business arrangement is:</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a single award Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. At this time the Government anticipates the period of Performance to include a one month phase-in period plus an eleven month base year and up to six (6) one year option periods. The total estimated value of the contract award is currently estimated to be between $75 and $95 million.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 488190 with a size standard of $32.5 million. Small businesses are encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>a. The Army's goal is to identify any reasonable alternatives for organizing, competing and administering the following on Refuel/Defuel contract that would allow more prime contractors to participate in the competition.</p>
<p>b. Please review and provide comments/suggestions on the DRAFT PWS to identify any inconsistencies or areas that need additional information in order to allow maximum participation by industry.</p>
<p>c. The Government seeks new and innovative suggestions regarding the approaches to accomplishing the PWS, both in terms of the end result of the services, and in terms of saving money.</p>
<p>d. Possible scenarios the government is considering: <br />1. The use of the Defense Logistics Agency to provide large holding tanks at outlying airfields;<br />2. Alternative work schedules for the services labor to reduce down-time;<br />3. Conducting a cost benefit analysis to determine cost savings by leasing tanker vehicles through the General Services Administration (GSA) Fleet leasing services.<br />4. Assessing the benefits of using fixed refuel resources at the various training Stagefields to reduce the size of the tanker fleet required to support the refuel mission.</p>
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS. The Army will not assume liability for cost incurred by any attendees, travel expenses or marketing efforts. ALL questions/answers and Government slides shall be posted via FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>The Government will be providing a Refuel/Defuel site tour beginning at 0900 CST on Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at Ford Hall, Bldg. 5207, Rm A16 Ft. Rucker, AL 36362.

<DESC>In order to meet future anticipated NASA airborne research platform needs, a large business class aircraft is anticipated to be required. NASA is looking to replace several aging Public Use government research aircraft with more modern aircraft (1-2 total) with performance and equipment capabilities to enable the full span of current and projected science and aeronautics research and development (R&amp;D) missions. The aircraft will be operated as a "State Aircraft" under Federal Air Regulations (FAR) Part 91 and will be assigned a NASA airworthiness certification.<br /><br />The research aircraft will be used on long-duration/range, high-altitude remote sensing missions, as well as, low-altitude atmospheric sampling missions with approximately 90% of flight time at altitudes over 20,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). NASA desires an aircraft capable of full international operations with a modified cabin with reconfigurable seating and research instrumentation packages. Some missions require in-situ sensors mounted on pylons to perform atmospheric measurements, others desire nadir and ventral portals that can be fitted with optical or specialty windows to enable remote LIght Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) measurements.<br />

<DESC>Emergency tree and hazardous debris removal Chimney Tops II wild fire recovery operations

A determination not to compete this proposed contract was made pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency. On the early morning hours of Wednesday, November 23 2016, a fire erupted in the Great Smoky Mountains NP at the summit near Chimney Tops.  By the evening of November 28th the fire had spread throughout the park and into the town of Gatlinburg TN, burning a mass amount of property and vegetation in its wake. Due to the Chimney Tops 2 Fire, conditions have been created that lead to hazards to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Hazard trees, blocked ditches and drainage structures, and eroding soils can all lead to dangerous conditions for the motoring public, including visitors and employees. Each of these hazardous conditions can lead to one of the other hazardous conditions.  Landslides, fallen trees, and flooding create hazards for visitors to the Park. A falling tree can injure or kill visitors. Also, trees that have fallen in significant amounts can trap visitors or park employees in an area. Road landslides can also strand motorists by trapping them in areas of the park. The park roads included in these projects are: Newfound Gap Road, Cherokee Orchard, Gatlinburg Bypass, and Spur (Foothills Parkway), and Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail After completing an initial landscape engineering assessment determined that park resources were inadequate to safely and timely address recovery effort and that contracted resources was the best approach.  Due the high risk of injury to the public and government employees, it was determined that seasoned contracted support was the best and only course of action to ensure recovery effort was completed successfully. 
The National Park Service, GRSM Contracting Office, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition in support of Chimney Tops II wild fire recovery operations with: RICHMOND TREE EXPERTS, INC. 1715 NEKOMA ST MARIETTA GA 30068-3364
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561730 Landscaping Services This notice of intent is not a formal solicitation or request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. No award will be made on the basis of quotations or offers received in response to this notice.
Interested parties may submit their interest and capabilities no later than Friday, December 30, 2016 10:00 a.m. EST. E-mail statements will be accepted but senders are responsible for ensuring the complete transmission and timely receipt. All inquiries shall be sent via e-mail to: ryan_pike@nps.gov. Any party responding to this notice shall send clear, factual documentation demonstrating their capabilities to meet and resell these items to the government. 
Once area is stabilized and covered, there will be a reassessment by Government leadership to determine if there is a contracted requirement for a phase 2 operations.  Should a phase 2 be required and contracted resources necessary, commercial acquisitions procedures will be adhered to in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for future requirements. A determination by the government not to compete this action is based on this notice and solely within the discretion of the government.

<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -2.7pt; tab-stops: .5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_rev2003.pdf" target="_blank">OMB Circular A-76</a> competition performance decisions).<br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM or AFISRA ombudsmen, [Insert names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and e-mail addresses]. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU or ARISRA level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis solicitation for the CBP Pre-Command School (PCS). Please see the attached Combined Synopsis Solicitation for further details.
<p><br />This requirement is being procured as a <strong>total Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) aside under NAICS code 611430</strong>.<br /><br />All proposals are due to Bryan.I.Campbell@cbp.dhs.gov by 4:00 EST, Wednesday, February 1, 2017.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to procure services for developing and delivering leadership curriculum for the CBP Pre-Command School (PCS). The PCS is a ten-day program over two-weeks designed to provide a comprehensive and systematic means of preparing senior managers and executives to assume a command position. The curriculum will focus on the critical operational and leadership mandates of a commander. The ten-day program will be 80% CBP-centric material, and 20% leadership-centric material. The Contractor will only be responsible for developing and delivering the leadership-centric curriculum.</p>
<p>The CBP PCS will provide a rigorous graduate level program of study designed to develop a broad perspective on management and leadership issues in a law enforcement organization, and cultivate strong abilities in the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs): Leading Change, Leading People, Results Driven, Business Acumen, and Building Coalitions/Communication.</p>
<p>The participants in the Pre-Command School will be a cross-functional mix of senior managers (GS-15s) and members of the Senior Executive Service (SES). This audience diversity enhances the opportunities for implementing change and integration both within and outside the classroom. Participants will be learning and applying the change initiatives across organizational lines, thus spreading the message to the rank and file. The participant mix will also reinforce networking opportunities among senior leaders. At the completion of the program, participants will be expected to perform successfully in key leadership positions at the senior GS-15 and SES level.</p>

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.

Schedule 73 Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services

Synopsis:

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective December 19, 2016  electronically. 

On June 23, 2016, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) published a General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) final rule to capture transactional data on procurements across all of its Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program contracts and Government-wide Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, to include Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs). The Transactional Data Reporting (TDR) Rule requires vendors to electronically report the price the Federal Government paid for an item or service purchased through GSA acquisition vehicles.

As part of the strategic implementation of the rule across all GSA contracts, the agency will introduce the transactional data reporting requirement with a pilot of select products and services in the FSS program. This pilot was introduced in a phased approach beginning in August 2016.  

Schedule 73 is participating in the pilot program.  You will be required to submit all offers under Refresh 28 documentation effective December 19, 2016.

Why is the GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) implementing this change? The goals of TDR are to:
- Significantly reduce burden to industry partners by eliminating Commercial Sales Practices (CSP) disclosure and Price Reductions clause (PRC) tracking requirements from Schedule contracts participating in the TDR pilot.
- Reduce contract administration burden for TDR pilot vendors once TDR is implemented. 
- Provide business intelligence to strengthen best value decision-making by ordering activities, which will allow customers to take full advantage of the wide variety and complexity of products and services offered by Schedule Partners and pass on savings to the taxpayer.
- Improve competition and increase transparency.
- Support category management and promote smarter buying.

With this refresh, the requirement for providing a CSP disclosure to accompany offer submissions will be eliminated. Other clauses and provisions are also being updated to implement TDR. This will result in significant burden reduction for our industry partners as outlined in the TDR Federal Register notice.  There is also a change to the content of the Price Proposal Spreadsheet in terms of MFC information required.  

Please note: For new offers received after the solicitation refresh under TDR pilot Schedules/SINs, the transactional data reporting clause and corresponding pricing disclosure changes will be mandatory for all awarded contracts.

For new contractors, reporting begins 30 days after the month in which the contract is awarded. 

GSA FAS published a public notice (Notice-FAS-2016-01) to solicit comments regarding the public release of transactional data reported in accordance with the GSAR Transactional Data Reporting clauses. GSA FAS will consider comments received in establishing its final position on which TDR data elements are releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). GSA looks forward to sharing publicly in what format intelligence gathered through TDR will be made available. 

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

This solicitation includes the following product/services: FSC Group 68: Chemicals and Chemical Products; FSC Group 72: Recycling Collection Containers and Waste Receptacles; FSC Group 73: Food Service Equipment, Supplies, and Services; FSC Group 79: Cleaning Equipment, Accessories, Janitorial Supplies, Cleaning Chemicals, and Sorbents; and FSC Group 85: Toiletries, Personal Care Items, Linens, and Lodging and Hospitality Supplies and Services, and Hospitality Wear. This solicitation is issued electronically only. This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. 

The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. The Trade Agreements Act applies to this solicitation. Small Business Set-Aside provisions will be addressed in the individual product/services attachments to the solicitation. The section at the beginning of the Vendor Response Document providing instructions for submitting a paper offer should be disregarded; Schedule 73 is a mandatory eOffer schedule, effective with Refresh 10. Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-C4-030073-B (include the dashes). 

To be the Government's leader in acquisition services, the General Services Administration (GSA) sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs.  To that end, GSA has recently awarded eighteen (18) Blanket Purchase Agreements in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) for Janitorial and Sanitation Commodities (JanSan).

In an effort to better allocate government resources and to improve our service to our customer base, GSA will temporarily postpone receipt of new offers under Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Schedule 73 for the following JanSan affected SINs: 375-100, 375-103, 375-107, 375-117, 375-125, 375-129, 375-135, 375-139, 375-200, 375-321, 375-323, 375-341, 375-351, 375-352, 375-353, 375-355, 375-356, 375-361, 375-362, 375-363, 375-364, 375-368, 375-371, 375-372, 384-2, 384-4, 384-9, 476-12, 476-13, 507-2, 507-4, 507-8, 658-1, 681-1, 852-1, 852-2 and 852-3 for the next twenty-four (24) months, effective January 16, 2015.  At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program.

Current Schedule 73 contract holders that are successfully performing and are meeting minimum sales criteria will continue to have their options exercised in accordance with I-FSS-163, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen).  There will be no change as it relates to modification requests by existing contractors.  Additionally, current successful contractors may submit a new offer as early as twenty-four (24) months prior to the expiration of their existing contract, regardless if the JanSan affected SINs are currently closed to new offer submission.

Therefore, GSA will be temporarily closing the JanSan affected SINs to new offers as of January 16, 2015. All offers received prior to that date will be reviewed, considered and evaluated for award as appropriate.  Offers not received by the deadline will not be considered and will be returned.  Offers will be considered on the above referenced SINs after the twenty-four (24) month postponement period has ended provided the SINs have been reopened via solicitation refresh.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to reject any offer which is non-compliant with the instructions reflected in SCP-FSS-001, SCP-FSS-002 and/or SCP-FSS-003 as required by the solicitation and/or is not substantially complete at the time of initial offer submission.

<DESC>ARCHITECT-ENGINEERING (A-E) SERVICES AT EIELSON AFB, AK.
<p>"Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s): Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs."</p>
<p>The 354th Contracting Squadron is seeking qualification packages and past performance information from vendors interested in providing professional architect and engineering services at Eielson AFB, AK to replace the low voltage electrical panels, lighting and wiring throughout the Central Heat &amp; Power Plant (CH&amp;PP).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The CH&amp;PP is a coal-fired cogeneration power plant providing steam for district heat and electricity for the facilities on Eielson AFB. The plant was originally built in 1952 and has six floors (including the basement). The majority of the low voltage (480V and lower voltage) electrical panels, lighting throughout the power plant and the interconnecting wiring are old and in poor condition. In addition, lighting levels in many parts of the plant are inadequate. In 2012 and 2013, a design was produced for replacement of all of the lighting and lighting panels in the plant as well as in the cooling pond pump house and the ash silo building. At the end of the design, it was determined that the project was too costly and should be broken into three phases, however, funding was not available at the time to modify the existing design contract. The design consultant, however, did provide a rough phasing plan. Since completion of the 2013 design, Boilers 5 and 6 at the plant have been replaced. As part of the boiler replacements, the lighting around those boilers has also been replaced, and other electrical changes have been made. Almost all areas inside the plant are dusty. Many areas are classified as Class II, Div 1 or 2, Group F. In addition, many of the metal surfaces inside may be coated with lead-based paint and there may be asbestos containing materials in the project area.</p>
<p>This is a competitive selection process in which competing offeror's qualifications will be evaluated in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 36.6 to determine the most highly qualified firms. The Government intends to award one Firm Fixed-Price contract.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 36.603(b): To be considered for architect-engineer contracts, a firm must file with the appropriate office or board the Standard Form 330, "Architect-Engineer Qualifications," Part II and when applicable, SF 330, Part I. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this posting; all costs associated with responding will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Failure to respond to this post does not preclude participation in the subsequent technical evaluation so long as a firm's SF 330 is currently on file with the 354th Contracting Squadron. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being solicited on a 100% Small Business Set-Aside basis. The NAICS 541330 (Engineering Services) applies to this acquisition, with a small business size standard of $15M. The Disclosure of Magnitude for the subsequest construction project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 IAW FAR 36.204(f).</p>
<p>The work to be performed shall include but is not limited to:</p>
<p>1. Site investigation, investigation of options, development of design concepts, and production of an investigation report, including a discussion of options with recommendations and cost estimates.<br />2. Development of the design documents for the selected option - including design analysis, specifications, drawings and cost estimates.<br />3. Attendance at the various project related meetings and review conferences.<br />4. Responding to review comments and making revisions to the design as agreed upon during the reviews.<br />5. Producing and submitting the final project design documents.</p>
<p>A-E EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS: A-E's experience shall include that which is commensurate with the requirements specific to the scope of design.</p>
<p>A. The ideal firm should have experience designing modifications and upgrades to low voltage electrical systems and lighting, especially in operating industrial plants and in hot, dirty and hazardous environments, specifically Class II, Div1 and 2, Group F; experience in surveying existing facilities for hazardous materials, and design including remediation of such hazards as necessary to complete the other work of the project.</p>
<p>B. The A-E shall demonstrate that they have experienced personnel with Alaska Registrations, and adequate capacity and depth in the following disciplines:</p>
<p>1. Electrical Engineering</p>
<p>C. The A-E shall demonstrate that they have experienced personnel with certification, and adequate capacity and depth in the following discipline:</p>
<p>1. Industrial Hygiene</p>
<p>The Air Force requires complete and functional designs that are appropriate for the sub-arctic environment for interior Alaska and that meet all applicable Federal, State, Local, Industry, U.S. Air Force and Eielson AFB requirements.</p>
<p>The A-E shall be responsible for all travel and lodging arrangements and expenses involved in the performance of work under this contract. The A-E shall furnish the Air Force with complete and usable products to include: planning documents, investigative reports, study reports, design analyses, project drawings, technical provisions (specifications), equipment layouts, cost estimates, submittal registers, quality assurance plans, constructability review reports, construction bidding amendments, construction contract modifications, and other documents.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component overhaul/overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the overhaul of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-17-Q-010036 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-92. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the OEM or a fully capable overhaul vendor.
<p>Any vendor, except the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or a Production Approval Holder (PAH), overhauling Coast Guard Aircraft Components MUST be FAA 145 certified and perform at least fifty percent (50%) of the work at their company's FAA certified facility. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, awards for the overhaul or overhaul of Coast Guard Aircraft Repairable Components shall only be awarded directly to service vendors who have been deemed fully capable of performing such services by division level command-appointed Coast Guard Engineers or Equipment Specialists.</p>
<p>Vendors who do not meet the above stated capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond to this solicitation/request for quote.</p>
<p>This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their overhaul data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future awards consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide service manuals or OEM service data. With their quote, vendors must provide a copy of the first page of the current OEM Manual or Service Reference, and in their quote make reference to it (i.e. "will be overhauled IAW CMM 12345-6789"). Quote must include Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and FOB Point. The HC-144A Aircraft OEM is AIRBUS DEFENSE AND SPACE SAU EADS CASA, AV. DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic overhaul facility Cage Code is 0DAF1. Any TT&amp;E plus average overhaul cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated overhaul cost plus a maximum economical overhaul cost. If a Small Business Set-Aside was applicable, IAW Small Business Administration, under NAICS Code 488190 the Small Business Size Standard is under $32,500,000.00. Therefore, this solicitation is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. This solicitation is for the overhaul of HC-144 Wheels IAW M.A.B.S. DUNLOP CMM 32-41-77 Revision 8 Dated 13 July 2012, as follows; .</p>

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

The program office now anticipates an RFP release in late December 2016 to ensure the release of a well-defined RFP. <br /><br />The Program's aim to refine RFP language stems from its participation as a pilot program for the U.S. Air Force's Bending the Cost Curve (BTCC) initiative. The BTCC initiative seeks to increase competition and find solutions that work for both the U.S. Air Force and industry. Program activities to refine RFP language, including extensive dialogue with industry, have taken longer than initially anticipated to complete. <br /><br />In order to align the production schedule with the Air Force strategic planning, the program's Full Operational Capability has been adjusted from Fiscal Year (FY) 2032 to FY34. It is important to note: the initial Operational Capability date remains FY 24. <br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">09 March 2016:<br /><br /></span></strong>1.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):  http://www.acquisition.gov/far, http://www.doi.gov/pam, http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/2010-7967.htm <BR> <BR>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- (A) Are [  ] are not [  ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [  ] have not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are [  ] are not [  ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and Cont... <BR> <BR>(D) Have [  ], have not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [  ] has not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights? (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract. (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties. (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes. Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence. (g) Invoice. (1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated in the contract to receive invoices. An invoice must include? (i) Name and address of the Contractor; (ii) Invoice date and number; (iii) Contract number, contract line item number and, if applicable, the order number; (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of the items delivered; (v) Shipping number and date of shipment, including the bill of lading number and weight of shipment if shipped on Government bill of lading; (vi) Terms of any discount for prompt payment offered; (vii) Name and address of official to whom payment is to be sent; (viii) Name, title, and phone number of person to notify in event of defective invoice; and (ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract. (x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information. (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract. (B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures. (C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT. (2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. Cont... <BR> <BR>(h) Patent indemnity. The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings. (i) Payment.? (1) Items accepted. Payment shall be made for items accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destinations set forth in this contract. (2) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. (3) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (4) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (5) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall? (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the? (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and (D) Contractor point of contact.

(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final decisions.

In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. (u) Unauthorized Obligations (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor?s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. (4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? <BR> <BR>(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to? (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: Cont... <BR> <BR>(i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.

(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. (3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. Cont... <BR> <BR>(ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor?s established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the? (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall? (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract.

If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ?None?.?] (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert ?$0? if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ?None?).?] Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. Cont... <BR> <BR>(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment?

(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost? (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor?s payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall? Cont... <BR> <BR>(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the?

(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. (6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in 41 U.S.C. 7109, which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if? (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2). Cont... <BR> <BR>(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on? (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the ?completion invoice? and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. Cont... <BR> <BR>(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. Cont... <BR> <BR>(8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. (9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (l) Termination for the Government?s convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor?s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-17-Q-J00027 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-92 effective 18 November 2016.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to International Enterprises (IE) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation.</p>
<p>All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), EFW Incorporated (EFW). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or OEM authorized distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that IE is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>

<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a USCG procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

i. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation RFQ VA101V-17-Q-0018 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The government anticipates a single (all or none), firm fixed price award.  The Government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order for the below line items to the responsible contractor whose quote, conforming to the solicitation, is considered the Best Value offer.

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier s quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.

<DESC>1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.<br /><br />1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is&nbsp;336413 -&nbsp;Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing&nbsp;which has a corresponding Size standard of 1,250 Employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, HUBZone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.<br /><br />2. Program Details:<br />Market Research is being conducted to seek qualified contractors other than PARKER HANNIFIN CORPORATION with the skills, knowledge, and resources required to transition new workload to Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The Government is seeking qualified contractors who can provide Integrated Flight Control Module Fixtures (IFCM) to the 309th Depot.<br /><br />The Air Force is in the process of preparing documentation to gain the required approval to issue a sole source request for proposal to PARKER HANNIFIN CORPORATION which has supported the Air Force in this capacity in the past. Statutory authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This sources sought synopsis is for information and budget planning only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.<br />The Government intends to award a contract that provides Integrated Flight Control Module Fixtures (IFCM) to the 309th Depot. The work will entail creating a commodity contract to purchase tools and equipment. PARKER HANNIFIN CORPORATION is the only known source that has the requisite equipment expertise of executing these services with the OEM parts, tooling, and processes that will be used by the 309th Commodities Maintenance Group (CMXG). <br /><br />Subject to the Government's consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite services should submit a concise, equipment specific and expertise response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that: (1) they possess the necessary skills and resources to procure OEM equivalent parts and the proprietary tooling used on C-17 Integrated Flight Control Modules Test Fixture. (2) They possess the necessary knowledge, expertise and technical capability of providing standard repairs and maintenance of C-17 Integrated Flight Control Modules Test Fixture. (3) They have the capability and demonstrated expertise to integrate and train the testing and repair processes.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Air Force will not pay for the effort, associated costs to respond, or for any information provided. <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will be normally considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Responses must be submitted by January 16, 2017, ATTN: Jason Grove, 5851 F Avenue, Bldg 849, Room C-12, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5805, or james.vaughan@us.af.mil. Questions will be accepted electronically directly from the requestor.</p>

We are greatly appreciative for all responses that were provided. The responses helped us understand the current state-of-the-art technology and will provide insight to our acquisition planning. NASA is still considering plans to pursue this work but is likely to delay any significant start until a future fiscal budget year. A future start of a procurement would likely include an opportunity for further NASA-industry dialogue, such as through a NASA trash processing systems industry forum.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and consideration. &nbsp;Please direct any questions to the primary point of contact below.</span></p>

<p>ORIGINAL 22 December 2015:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: <br />Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC-ORL) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) in support of United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) requirements. This acquisition will be referred to as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). NOTE: This SSN was associated with Special Notice and Request for Information (RFI) listed under solicitation number W900KKHTASC. UAS requirements will be supported by a separate contract vehicle now associated with this SSN's solicitation number W900KK-16-R-0024.</p>
<p>Potential North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for UAS: 611512 Flight Training.</p>
<p>The Government has provided a DRAFT UAS Performance Work Statement (PWS, Attachment 01 to this SSN).</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information regarding relevant experience and capabilities of industry partners interested in performing this potential requirement. Responses to this SSN will be used to gain insight from industry's experience performing similar requirements and to analyze the information in order to develop a contract vehicle capable of supporting the described mission. Based on this assessment, the Government will finalize an acquisition strategy and generate a formal draft solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government encourages industry to provide comments and suggestions relating to acquisition strategy to include: NAICS, contract type, contract structure, teaming arrangements, small business participation/set asides, etc.</p>
<p>The Government also encourages industry to provide questions, comments, and suggestions relating to the PWS provided. Questions received will be consolidated, answered and, if deemed valuable information for all interested parties, will be posted at a later date on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. The Government will not disclose the identity of the potential offeror asking the questions.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>USAACE's training requirements were previously supported by Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) through the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract and the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract. USAACE's Warfighter FOCUS (WFF) requirements will be supported by the new UAS solicitation number W900KK-16-R-0024.</p>

<p>Please submit all responses (and any other written correspondence) to the following email inbox (the size limitation is 20MB) with email Subject: "UAS Sources Sought Notice Response".</p>

Firms can provide verbatim language from the HTASC RFI #1 (W900KKHTASC) submission as needed.</p>
<p>Section II.

<p>5. Relating to the instructor qualifications, will your firm be able to provide fully trained employees by the period of performance start date as required by the attached DRAFT PWS? If not, how do you intend to meet the requirements? What limitations does your firm have?

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate, under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis with the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York for the following requirement: Daily Activity Measured with Accelerometry in a Clinical Trial: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Unload the Left Ventricle in Patients with Advanced Heart Failure (TAVR UNLOAD). The government will use procedures in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code will be 541712 (1,000 employees). This effort will be for a period of two (2) years beginning on or about June 13, 2017.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The Cardiovascular Research Foundation is uniquely qualified to conduct this study as they are a well-known independent organization that coordinates clinical trials in the area of cardiovascular research. In addition, the Cardiovascular Research Foundation is conducting large clinical trials related to transarterial catheterization for aortic stenosis, the condition that NIA will be studying.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to estimate the change in daily activity over time, comparing patients with aortic valvular disease and congestive heart failure who are randomized, to either optimal therapy for congestive heart disease or to transcatheter replacement of their aortic valve combined with optimal therapy for congestive heart disease. Currently, there are few trials using accelerometry that longitudinally characterize change in daily activity over the course of the trial. The goals of adding an ancillary study with accelerometry are several-fold. First, the ancillary study would provide data regarding the central question of the trial-over the course of the trial,<br />with ascertainment periods at one (1) month, six (6) months, one (1) year, and two (2) years; will daily activity be greater in subjects who have had their valve replaced via a transcatheter approach? Secondly, will sleep quality and indicators of circadian rhythm be better preserved in subjects with congestive heart failure who are randomized to treatment with aortic valve replacement? The repeated objective monitoring data in the trial will provide specific information on change in activity volume, duration, intensity and distribution that also will allow study of hypotheses regarding the natural history of congestive failure and change in function over time as well as change in function and recovery related to TAVR UNLOAD. Lastly, the ancillary study accelerometry data will allow assessment of whether there is utility in the larger question of inclusion of objective monitoring within clinical trials, given the many other measurements of functional status included in the trial.</p>
<p>This requirement needs to be carried out in the context of a clinical trial in which there is, a) a patient population with congestive heart failure and aortic stenosis, and b) a patient population randomized to test the safety and efficacy of TAVR via a transfemoral approach in the setting of congestive heart failure. This study should have functional measurements to which objective monitoring can be compared in terms of what novel information it can bring to clinical trial outcomes.</p>
<p>Since this is a sole source requirement, the solicitation will not be made available through FedBizOpps (FBO). However, the solicitation can be obtained by sending an electronic request (via email) to Heather Orandi at Heather.Orandi@nih.gov. In return, the requestor will receive a copy of the solicitation in an adobe format. In addition, a draft Statement of Work is attached for further clarification of this requirement. All requests must be sent no later than 12:00 P.M. (EST) on January 11, 2017. Otherwise, the government will not be obligated to respond to requests after the above mentioned due date. No telephone or facsimile responses will be accepted.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-16-024 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-16-024.</p>

<DESC><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">PMA 209 will host an industry day to brief the Midair Collision Avoidance Capability (MCAC) program. The purpose of the MCAC system is to increase situational awareness (SA) and to alert the pilot of other aircraft that pose air-to-air collision threat. To accomplish this, MCAC is expected to use aural/visual/tactile alerts to notify the pilot of conflicting traffic and potential collisions. MCAC will need to sense traffic and track nearby aircraft computing their expected trajectories to evaluate the potential for midair collision. The system will need to interface with aircraft displays to present SA information and with the warning, caution, and advisory (WCA) systems to provide pilots with warnings of potential midair collisions.</span></p>
<p>Current requirements are defined in the Aircraft Survivability/ Initial Capabilities Document (AS/ICD) and the OPNAV Instruction 13210.1B Naval Aviation Policy for Aircraft Avionic Safety Systems.</p>
<p>The MCAC program will evaluate sensors, sensor fusion and collision avoidance algorithms for MCAC use in tactical, non-tactical and emissions control (EMCON) environments with MH-60R/S and AH-1Z/UH-1Y as the lead MCAC platforms. The MCAC program is expected to use an incremental acquisition approach and will address intruder aircraft encounter scenarios in tactical and non-tactical environments in Increment 1. Later increments will include additional platforms, collision avoidance for rendezvous and formation flight scenarios, and operation in the EMCON environment. Based on an MCAC AoA conducted in 2012 and responses to a Sources Sought announcement to Industry in February 2015 (reference #41011GW2), increment one is expected to utilize a military transponder as the primary sensor with Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) - and Mode 5 Level 2 Broadcast (M5L2B). Planned MCAC Increment 1 IOC is 2025 when the first 12 aircraft will be outfitted with the MCAC solution.</p>
<p>If your organization has a MCAC like capability or enabler we want to hear about it. Limited 30 minute time slots will be available on the day of the event and the day after to listen to industry and exchange ideas about your sensor and/or algorithm. If you also desire a one-on-one meeting please indicate so when you sign up and provide us with company information on the attached form .</p>
<p>Date &amp; Location</p>
<p>Date: 25 January, 2017<br />Time - 10:00-12:00<br />Location: SAIC<br />45310 Abell House Ln<br />California, MD 20619</p>

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract modification to contract N62742-11-D-1801, a Firm-fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The proposed modification will increase the not-to-exceed contract amount by $10 million to $73 million.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Government intends to award the sole source contract modification to TEC-AECOM Pacific Joint Venture based on the Contractors extensive knowledge of on-going projects for which they are able to provide continuity of services and timely completion of project requirement and avoid duplication of effort and unacceptable delays.


Contract Task Order (CTO) 0023 was awarded at $14.5M on 28 July 2016 to prepare the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Island (CNMI) Joint Military Training (CJMT) revised draft and final Environmental Impact Statement/Overseas Environmental Impact Statement (EIS/OEIS).
  In September 2016, there was an unforeseen change to the alternative method to conduct amphibious beach landing training under CTO 0023. This alternative method, landing ramps cut into coastal bluffs (cliff cuts) will avoid use of existing beaches and greatly reduce impact to marine (coral) and cultural resources.  This modified alternative will
require additional planning and environmental studies to support NEPA analysis.  An additional $10M contract capacity is required to complete this work as justified in the attached Justification and Approval (J and A).


This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.


Interested firms may identify and transmit their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to both valerie.mito@navy.mil and kristopher.tom@navy.mil by close of business, 19 January 2017.

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101. In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.") <BR> <BR>Delivery order awards shall only be made to the firm that has the GSA FSS contract awarded to them.

<AWARDEE>Eaton Aerospace, LLC., 24 Glenolden Ave, Glenolden, PA 19036 US
<DESC>NSN 4820-01-408-2416. Item Description: Valve, Safety Relief. Manufacturer's Code and Part Number: 97484 P/N B586V<br />Quantity: 107. Unit of Issue: EA. Destination Information: New Cumberland PA. Delivery Schedule: 91 days. <br />All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 5-11-16. The Small Business size standard is 750 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.<br />This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved source is: Eaton Corp. (97484) <br />While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. <br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307. <br />One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.<br />Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br />Various increments solicited: 62-124, 125-168, 169-212, 213-256<br />
