<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified below for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If the contacting officer does not satisfy your concerns, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Major Harrington, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 478-926-2604.

The 11th Contracting Squadron intends to procure as a total small business set-aside  assistance to Former Soviet Union (FSU) scientists in employing proper English language usage, translating extremely technical scientific information, adhering strictly to applicable publication style guides, and presenting data charts and figures in meaningful, lucid formats which culminates in the acceptance of their work for publication.  The contractor shall provide much more than just translation assistance.  In fact, the contractor shall establish a technical working relationship with each FSU scientist so as to become a trusted colleague who can provide candid editorial feedback and advice that will be readily accepted.  The contractor shall possess a technical PhD, as well as an undergraduate and graduate degree in an engineering discipline.  The contractor shall have an extensive publication record in both the United States and Russia. The contractor shall have experience serving as an editor of a peer reviewed scientific/technical journal. Additionally, an established rapport with the Russian Academy of Sciences and technical expertise in Information Technology and/or mathematics and computer science would also be especially beneficial.  The contractor shall maintain on-going interaction with the FSU scientists and sponsoring Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) scientists, and is expected to assist in organizing and coordinating joint scientific/technical conferences, workshops, and seminars as required. 3.1-Description of Services  The AFOSR International Office (AFOSR/IO) requires a minimum of 500 hours of contractor support per 12 month period under this requirement.  The resulting contract will be labor hours with a cost reimbursable line item for travel.  The contractor shall complete the following tasks to achieve the requirements described in the above paragraph. TASK 1- Review and Critique: The contractor shall review, critique, modify and correct (as required) research papers and project reports produced by AFRL funded FSU scientists to ensure compliance with the general publication standards established for American scientific journals.

TASK 3-  Organize Conferences and Workshops: The contractor shall assist AFRL (in particular AFOSR/IO and the European Office of Aerospace Research and Development) in organizing and coordinating joint scientific/technical conferences, workshops, and seminars as directed.  TASK 4-Organize Information Security Conferences: The contractor shall organize Information Security conferences in St. Petersburg, Russia in Rome, NY and help facilitate the organization with other scientific meetings as the need arises. TASK 5-Travel: Some limited travel shall be required to perform these tasks, but shall not exceed one trip per year to Russia and quarterly trips per year to selected AFRL facilities within the U.S.  The locations of these facilities are AFOSR in Arlington, VA and the AFRL Information Directorate in Rome, NY.  All requests for travel shall require prior coordination with AFOSR/IO, and shall be paid on a reimbursable basis. 3.2- Government Furnished Property/Services  None.  The contractor shall furnish all required information technology equipment (e.g. computers, printers, word processing software, e-mail service) necessary in the performance of the contract.  3.3-General Information  3.3.1-Billing: AFOSR/IO shall be billed only for hours expended.

The Contracting Officers Representative (COR) at AFOSR shall also track labor hours expended by the contractor. Incidental costs for postage and overseas telephone charges shall be submitted to AFOSR/IO for approval and reimbursement, and submitted on the monthly invoice along with the hours expended.  The COR shall review and certify the invoice (if the costs are agreed to and services were accepted) upon receipt.  If there is a discrepancy on the invoice, the COR shall return the uncertified invoice to the contractor.  If there are no discrepancies, the COR shall be responsible for forwarding the certified invoice to the appropriate Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) to ensure prompt payment. 3.3.2-Submission of Papers for Editorial Support  The contractor shall provide a copy of all papers submitted for editorial support to AFOSR/IO and the appropriate Technical Directorate Point of Contact (POC) prior to beginning work; electronic copies provided via e-mail will be acceptable.

<DESC>NOTE: THIS IS A RE-ADVERTISEMENT OF THE PREVIOUSLY SYNOPSIZED U.S. CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER PROJECT. PLEASE REFER TO SOLICITATION NUMBERS GS-03P-02-AOC-0001 ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 9 NOVEMBER, 2001 AND GS-03P-02-AOC-0002 ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 21 DEC, 2001. THESE TWO PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMBINED AND WILL BE AWARDED AS A SINGLE CONTRACT. THIS PROCUREMENT IS HEREBY OPEN TO ALL QUALIFIED RESPONDENTS.

The Architect of the Capitol (AOC), with the assistance of the General Services Administration (GSA), announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings and the intent to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Construction Services for The United States Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) and related work in and around the Capitol Building, Washington, DC. The CVC will greatly enhance the experience of visiting the U.S. Capitol building. Not only will it significantly enhance security for the Capitol, but it will provide new educational opportunities for visitors and improve accessibility and visitor comfort. As designed, the CVC will compliment the Capitol building and its surroundings and will become a seamless addition to the
Capitol complex. The CVC will be located underground on the East Front of the Capitol, so as to enhance rather than detract from the appearance of the Capitol and its historic Frederick Law Olmsted landscaping. When completed, the CVC will contain approximately 580,000 square feet on three levels, requiring approximately a 196,000-square-foot excavation, or "footprint," on the East Front of the Capitol. The CVC will include space for exhibits, visitor comfort, food service, two orientation theaters, an auditorium, gift shops, security, connections to existing buildings, service tunnels for underground vehicle access to the Capitol, loading docks, mechanical facilities, and storage. The CVC will preserve and maximize public access to the Capitol while greatly enhancing the experience for the millions who walk its historic corridors and experience its monumental spaces every year. This solicitation will address only a portion of the work required to complete the CVC, as noted below. The Architect of the Capitol will utilize a ?best value? source selection process to enable selection from among high quality contractors for this procurement. The project will be constructed in two (2) sequences.    This advertisement is for Sequence 1 of the project which will require extensive coordination between this contractor and contractors of prior enabling projects and the subsequent Sequence 2, as well as with contractors performing other AOC projects in the immediate vicinity of the project.  Sequence 1 is for the Foundation/Structure work which includes, but is not limited to, Miscellaneous Site Demolition, Slurry Wall Construction, Excavation, Installation of Load Bearing Elements (including Caissons with imbedded Steel Columns), Concrete, Structural Steel, Tunnel/Tunnel Concrete, Elevator Jack Holes, Small Mechanical and Electrical and Site Civil. The estimated construction cost for Sequence 1 is in the range of $80 to $100 million. The contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided), and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet AOC requirements. The Contractor will perform the construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings, and the provisions of the contract. The solicitation for Sequence 1 will be issued in two (2) phases. Phase I will be for technical proposals and will include a set of draft specifications and drawings. It will be available on or about 02/13/2002. UNDER THIS PART THE GOVERNMENT WILL EVALUATE PAST PERFORMANCE, TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED OF THEIR TECHNICAL STANDING PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF PHASE II, WHICH WILL BE A REQUEST FOR OFFERORS OF HIGH TECHNICAL STANDING TO SUBMIT PRICING PROPOSALS BASED UPON COMPLETED SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS. Phase II of the solicitation will be issued approximately 45 days after receipt of
proposals for Phase I. The government will award a fixed-price contract after evaluation of both Phases I and II proposals resulting from this solicitation to the responsive and responsible offeror determined by the government to be the ?best value? to the government. For this procurement, technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price, but no specific numerical weight will be assigned to price for evaluation purposes. Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used similar to those in FAR 15. Offerers are advised an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received. The government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the government to be the most advantageous to the government. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms. NOTE: Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for proposal preparation costs. To be considered for final award, potential offeror must submit proposals per the RFP to BOTH Phase I and Phase II of the solicitation on the due dates established. A pre-proposal meeting and site visit will be held at the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) project field office at a date to be determined later. The RFP Phase I will be issued by the Contract Specialist at GSA, Mid Atlantic Region in Philadelphia, PA, and posted electronically on the www.fedbizops.gov website. Hard copies or CD?s of the draft specifications and drawings and RFP Phase II, Technical Specifications and Drawings will be issued by the AOC, Washington, DC. In order for potential offerors to be placed on the bidders list for hard copies or CD?s, respondents must submit a written request via fax to Cal Durgin, (202) 228-2073 or e-mailed to cdurgin@aoc.gov. Requests from prime contractors must include a letter from the surety stating their capacity for bonding in amounts covering the estimated prices cited above to receive hard copies or CD?s. Any questions regarding this synopsis may be directed to Cal Durgin, CVC Contract Specialist, at (202) 228-2370 or Dan Correnti, GSA Contract Specialist, at (215) 656-6152. This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAIC code 233320.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Catalysis2000 Consortium DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technoloy Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a  purchase order on a sole-source basis to Accelrays Inc, Charlottesville, VA to purchase amembership in the following: Catalysis2000 Consortium. Business Needs Catalysis is a key technology for the chemical and petrochemical industries. It is responsible for the production of $800 billion a year in products. The chemical industry is subject to many external pressures including the forces of globalization, increasingly stringent environ-mental regulation and customer demand for better products at lower prices. These business drivers impact the field of catalysis. In particular they create the need for higher performance catalysts and to reduce the time scale to develop new catalysts. Skyrocketing research and development costs are heightening the awareness of computation as a key emerging technology for catalysis research. In one published example, a group of catalyst experts from U.S. industries, academia and government agencies examined future needs of the chemical industry in the field of catalysis in the light of these business imperatives. Their findings are reported in the Vision 2020 Catalysis Report. One of their major conclusions is that "New catalyst design through combined experimental, mechanistic understanding, and improved computational modeling of catalytic processes," will be a critically enabling area of science. The remit of the Vision 2020 Catalysis Team was specifically to look at the needs of U.S. industry. However given the global nature of today's chemical industry their conclusions are applicable worldwide. The rapid pace of change in the world of computer hardware, coupled with advances in algorithms, has created an opportunity to address these bottlenecks. In recent years the graphics and CPU performance of desktop machines has improved enormously and all standard visualization tasks in the field of catalysis modeling can now be done with the standard NT hardware that has become ubiquitous in chemical and petrochemical companies. The possibility for electronic communication of results and data across the R&D organization is further enhanced through the development of corporate intranets. In the world of parallel computing there is a trend towards machines built from low-cost commodity components. The next three years will see the emergence of parallel machines running a new generation of 64-bit Intel processors, and likely a step change in the computational power at the disposal of the modeling professional in industry. Advances in linear scaling algorithms for quantum calculations will allow orders of magnitude speed-ups on simulations of big systems. Proposed Solution: Catalysis 2000 Consortium ACCELRYS proposes a new three-year project, the Catalysis 2000 Consortium, to capitalize on these opportunities. The goal of the consortium will be to enable companies to accelerate the catalysis discovery and optimization process by using modeling to understand chemical mechanisms, as an integral part of the overall R&D process. Three major activities will be pursued:   1. Development of a next generation of high performance simulation engines, and reaction drivers for modeling catalytic reaction mechanisms. The capabilities will be designed to run on the coming generation of parallel Intel hardware and will enable simulations to be performed on a broad range of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, in industrially acceptable time scales. A primary development goal is delivery of a version of ACCELRYS's first-principles quantum code, DMol3, that is capable of performing geometry optimizations on systems with 10,000 basis functions (500-1000 atoms) in less than one day on hardware costing less than $100k. The consortium will also pursue advances in ACCELRYS's CASTEP and Discover technology, and implementation of hybrid quantum classical methods. Full details of the development program can be found in the Catalysis 2000 proposal.   2. The Consortium team will develop Application Guides to enable the membership to apply the software to areas of industrial importance in the field of catalysis. Application Guides will be compiled by ACCELRYS staff, in collaboration with leading external consultants. An Application Guide may look at the application of molecular simulation in a particular field such as oxidation catalysis, polymerization with Ziegler-Natta catalysts or alkane activation over metal surfaces. One Application Guide will be produced in each year of the Consortium, in an area selected in consultation with the membership.   3. Development of a new broadly deployable molecular modeling environment called Materials Studio?. Materials Studio? will serve the needs of expert modelers and will also be used to disseminate modeling results and data across the R&D organization. The new environment will run under NT on standard desktop machines, thereby leveraging hardware investments already made by most chemical companies. Materials Studio? will link seamlessly to other PC-based software productivity tools. The environment will employ a client-server architecture and will allow large scale calculations to be launched on remote Unix, Linux or NT machines. The Consortium will be advised by a scientific advisory board of leading experts in the field of catalyst simulation, and will work to facilitate scientific interactions between the membership, the ACCELRYS staff and the board. The ACCELRYS consortium team will consist of a technical director, an applications science team and two development teams based in San Diego and Cambridge. This request is considered to be sole source to Accelrys Inc., because their personnel are uniquely qualified to perform the required tasks and the following reasons: ACCELRYS has been developing tools for molecular modeling of catalysts since 1991, primarily through the Catalysis and Sorption Consortium. The Consortium development agenda has evolved, as new types of simulation have become feasible through advances in algorithms and hardware. Early years of the Consortium were concerned with the development of visualization and model construction capabilities. Subsequently analytical instrument simulations and methods for modeling diffusion and sorption phenomena in microporous materials were added. The most recent phase of the Consortium has made extensive use of the quantum mechanics technology for studying molecular catalysis. ACCELRYS Inc. is currently the only company that offers quantum mechanics simulation capabilities that span the molecular world of homogeneous catalysis and the periodic world of heterogeneous catalysis. The Catalysis and Sorption Consortium has proven to be a highly successful vehicle for the development of commercially relevant software. Modeling technology is used by many of the major chemical and petrochemical companies as a standard method for developing and optimizing catalysts. Hundreds of publications and a growing role in the patent literature attest to the impact that the Catalysis and Sorption Consortium software is having on the field of catalysis.  This request is considered to be sole source to ACCELRYS Inc..  Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  This award shall be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-892-6216 and e-mail mohn@netl.doe.gov.

The FAA plans to discuss these documents along with other programmatic information during Industry Day II, Jan 22- 25, 2002 with those vendors whose reservations have been confirmed by the FAA NEXCOM Program Office. <P> The final SRD has been updated based upon a review of comments previously submitted by interested parties. <P> The MTD describes in detail the full set of requirements (based upon the SRD) to design and build the HW and SW components of the NEXCOM System Engineering Design Model (EDM) for the Rapid Preliminary Development Effort (RPDE).  The MTD is a subset of SRD requirements.  The EDM will be used during the Full Scale Development Program (FSDP) technical evaluation process to demonstrate and verify vendor understanding of basic VDL Mode 3 technology.   The SRD is provided for information.  Limited comments concerning the draft MTD should be presented to the FAA at the scheduled one-on-ones during Industry Day II; however, formal written comments can be submitted through the period of January 11 to February 22, 2002.

<DESC>N00178-01-Q-3040, Amendment 0001  This synopsis was orginally posted to the Commerce Business Daily on 12 October 2001.  This is only a re-posting.  If you have already responded to the original request, do not submit another white paper.

Questions and answers in respect to Commerce Business Daily Submission No. 50X978 dated 18 September 2001.  Closing date remains the same.

Questions & Answers:

Q1.  I know that Dahlgren is interested in technologies which can detect CWA/BWA inside a sealed container.  Does the screening system have to detect these agents while the sealed container is itself contained inside something else (e.g. package, suitcase, clothing)?  Can a suspect, sealed container be handled separately and held up (or presented automatically) for sensing by a probe?

A1. The Government will consider any white paper submitted to satisfy the comprehensive requirement or elements of the requirement.  A significant element of the requirement is reliable detection of sealed containers hidden inside of something else.  Reliable detection of CWA and/or BWA within those containers is another significant element of the requirement.  

Any proposed solution must satisfy, or contribute in a valuable way to satisfaction of one, more than one, or all of the advertised requirements and must be relevant to a check point environment.    

Q2.  What types of containers are being targeted?  (i.e., metal, glass,...all?)

A2.  Any containers, of any materials, which might be utilized to conceal CWA/BWA, are targets of the detection system(s) defined by the BAA.

Q3.  What types of containers MUST the demonstration system work with?  (Assuming it may not work on all containers.)

A3.  The demonstration system must work with those containers proposed for demonstration.  The proposed demonstration must have technical merit, i.e., the solution proposed for demonstration must satisfy, or contribute in a valuable way to satisfaction of one, more than one, or all of the advertised requirements.

Q4.  I assume that the desired final solution is an integrated design capable of working with all container types.  However, would it be equally acceptable if it consisted of multiple devices that address specific container types?

A4.  You are not prohibited from offering multiple devices to detect an array of specific container types.  It is possible that multiple devices may be the best way to satisfy the requirement or elements of the requirement.  However acceptability of a solution, for award, can only be determined when the Government has a viable offer.

Q5.  Can you confirm that although the white paper is due no later than 2/1/2002, it is highly recommended that it be submitted no later than 11/1/2001 (45 days after solicitation release)?

A5.  The BAA states:  ?White papers received after the 45-day period may be evaluated if funds beyond those contemplated for award remain available.?  It is therefore possible that papers received after that initial period will not be evaluated.  Nevertheless, offerors must judge for themselves when a paper can be submitted.

Q6.  Is this a completely new solicitation or is this a follow on to a previous solicitation or development program?

A6.  This BAA is a ?new? requirement.

Q7.  Should we anticipate that the program will be classified after award, and thus maintain, in advance, appropriate procedures, including containers for a retroactive classification of the notes, drawings, and text of the White Paper?

A7.  White papers are to be unclassified.  The classification level, of projects that may be awarded pursuant to this solicitation, has not yet been determined.  The Government does not intend to retroactively classify white papers.  Offerors are responsible for ensuring white papers contain no classified information.  White papers may state, as appropriate, that specific previous work in a proposed area of endeavor was classified and may therefore recommend classification of a proposed project.  Additionally, any proprietary information referenced in the white paper must be identified as such.  As previously stated, the Government has the option of asking for additional technical information, if need exists.  Nevertheless, each white paper, as it stands alone, must include enough technical detail to allow the Government to make informed decisions.

Questions & Answers:

Q1.  I would like to know whether the anticipated feasibility budget could include between $5,000,000 and $50,000,000 for the feasibility study and whether the production budget could include development costs of more than $1,000,000,000 over five years.

A1. Costs in the range you have identified exceed our anticipated budget.  Funds allocated for feasibility studies/follow-on efforts will be based on sponsor interest in solutions posed by white papers and subsequent proposals.  The submission of a white paper is highly encouraged.  In the absence of at least a white paper we will be unable to determine how promising your offer might be, and therefore unable to solicit any additional funds that might be required to do the necessary feasibility and prototyping efforts.

Q2. Will Dahlgren consider conducting modeling and simulation on the proposed methods selected for consideration to determine the best method for sampling?

A2.  You may submit a white paper and propose any solution you wish, to satisfy one or more of the stated requirements of the BAA.  The Government will consider all reasonable offers/white papers submitted timely.  White papers will be evaluated using the criteria identified in the BAA.

Questions & Answers in respect to Commerce Business Daily Submission No. 50X978 dated 18 September 2001 and subsequent modifications dated 12 October  2001 and 25 October 2001 respectively:

Q1.  Is there any current money for this project?

A1.  Yes, there is current money in-house to fund the first stage of this project. We feel this money is sufficient to start-up efforts to address the stated problems.  

Q2.  What is the likelihood that we could get enough of this money to make the proposal writing effort a good use of our time?"

A2.  The BAA is a request for white papers only.  From the paragraph on White Paper Submittal in the BAA:  "White papers may propose novel sensor technologies, and innovative components or subsystems, which hold the potential of greatly improving the performance, or feasibility, of screening systems to identify BWA/CWA inside sealed containers."  Also, from the second paragraph, "It is anticipated that the Government will request a comprehensive technical and cost proposal for the most promising approach/concept identified by one or more white papers."  The white papers provide the vehicle for further discussions with companies that have identified promising technical approaches and concepts. A request to a company for a cost proposal will follow the white paper submittal and any subsequent discussions.  It will be up to the individual company to decide whether it is in their best interest to submit the cost proposal.  Please note that without a white paper there is no basis for future discussions related to this procurement.  The submittal of white papers is highly encouraged.

The U. S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set-aside an acquisition for Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) concerns only.  The estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 234990 and the small business size standard is $27.5 Million.  The acquisition is for demolition, removal, and disposal of the existing timber pier and piles including fuel, sanitary, water and compressed air lines and electrical power; construction of a new wood fixed pier and a concrete floating pier; providing and installing new pier-mounted electrical, water, sanitary, compressed air shore ties, and fuel station including all piping; and performance of all associated work as indicated in Specification 01-L5001 and Drawings 01-L5001, Sheets 1-26.  Work includes a base bid item.  At the present time, the acquisition is expected to be issued under full and open competition procedures.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUBZone certified and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail or facsimile to Ms. Victoria Worrell at vworrell@fdcclant.uscg.mil or (757) 852-3495 (fax).

Your response is requested by February 28, 2001.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on availability of interested HUBZone concerns.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in a contractor not being considered as an interested HUBZone concern.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone small business set-aside or on an unrestricted basis will be posted on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) web site.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) seeks information about sources capable of continuing operation of the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (the Registry). The Public Health Service Act, Section 379, mandates the Registry to facilitate unrelated bone marrow transplantation by matching patients with volunteer unrelated donors. Successful marrow transplants require a close match of tissue types between patient and donor. The Act requires the Registry, among other things, to: (1) establish and maintain a Board of Directors that meets certain compositional requirements; (2) establish and manage a system for finding marrow donors suitably matched to unrelated patients who need a marrow transplant; (3) conduct public education activities regarding the availability of unrelated donor transplants facilitated by the Registry and the need for additional donors; (4) recruit and conduct tissue typing of potential marrow donors; (5) maintain a nationwide registry of potential volunteer donors and a scientific registry of recipients of unrelated donor transplants; (6) establish standards for tissue typing, donor selection criteria, and procedures for marrow collection and transportation; (7) collect, analyze and publish data pertinent to unrelated donor marrow transplantation and the operation of the Registry, including data concerning patient outcomes at each transplant center; (8) provide advocacy and case management services to patients and donors; and (9) conduct other activities to increase marrow donation and the success of unrelated donor marrow transplants, and to reduce the differences in the chances of finding a matched donor between Caucasians and other population groups. The Registry currently maintains formal agreements with numerous organizations in the U.S. and other countries, including 136 transplant centers, 91 donor centers, 16 foreign cooperative registries, 9 recruitment groups, 90 apheresis centers, 110 marrow collection centers, 11 cord blood banks, 22 laboratories, and 3 tissue repositories. The Registry contains 4.6 million volunteer potential donors. Each year, the Registry conducts approximately 8,000 searches for donors and facilitates nearly 2,000 transplants, many of them involving foreign donors or patients. The Registry must comply with Section 379 of the Public Health Service Act and other pertinent Federal requirements related to informed consent, confidentiality and privacy, data collection and publication, and computer security. The Registry submits proposed international agreements to HRSA for submission to the Department of State for clearance. Federal funding of the Registry began in 1987 with a grant from the Department of the Navy; Department of Health and Human Services funding began in 1990. The fiscal year 2002 HRSA appropriation for the Registry approximates $20 million. Sources of further information include the Public Health Service Act and the web sites of: the current Registry contractor, the National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow.org), and the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (www.ibmtr.org). You may obtain a paper copy of the current HRSA contract for the Registry by sending a self-addressed, pre-stamped envelope with your written request to Keith Kennedy, Health Resources and Services Administration, PKLN 13A-19, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD  20857. 
Potential offerors may send a capability statement to Mr. Kennedy at the above address no later than February 22 specifically addressing the following criteria: (1) ability to establish and maintain a Board of Directors and committee structure; (2) ability to establish and ensure compliance with quality standards and operating procedures in health care; (3) ability to negotiate and manage large numbers of contracts with different types of health care organizations, in the U.S. and other countries; (4) ability to create and maintain a large automated registry in health care with the capability of conducting rapid searches of the registry using complex algorithms; (5) ability to establish and manage a program of donor recruitment, tissue typing and tissue repositories; (6) ability to establish and manage a program of public and professional education; (7) ability to provide patient advocacy services; and (8) ability to conduct a program of analysis and peer review published research in health care; and (9) past performance information concerning experience with projects similar in size and scope to the Registry above described.

<DESC>POC: Kathleen Markley, U.S. Geological Survey, P.O. Box 25046, MS 204B, Denver, CO 80225.  Telephone: (303) 236-9325, email: kmarkley@usgs.gov. 
Concerns having the ability to furnish the following scientific and engineering support services described herein are requested to give written notification (including telephone and point of contract) to the procuring office above.  U.S. Geological Survey, EROS Data Center (EDC) has a requirement for support services to provide scientific and engineering analyses to support the USGS?s responsibility for the design, development and management of operational and follow-on satellite-based land remote sensing mission.  USGS must be provided with timely, objective and non-advocacy inputs to plan, execute and evaluate system procurements and operational satellite anomalies.  A unique requirement of this effort is that it must be conducted  in an independent fashion with freedom from any bias that would result in predilection towards any particular hardware and/or software design or approach.  A demonstrated history of freedom from organizational conflict of interest is an essential requirement.  The highly technical nature of the support required by the USGS presents the need for access to a diversity of technical hardware, software, and operation skills, and to extensive databases and information sources.  The ability to obtain, integrate, and protect proprietary information from domestic, foreign, and international contractors without fear of disclosure is a requirement for anyone providing this support, due to the levels of proprietary information involved.  The capability and proven track record for successfully integrating and protecting proprietary information on multi-contractor programs is required.  Also required is extensive, detailed, previous experience in operational and follow-on satellite-based land remote sensing to provide the breadth and depth of expertise needed for mission support.
Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the item specified as a sole source from Aerospace Corporation, Arlington, VA, which has demonstrated such non-advocacy independence in forty years experience with USGS, NASA, and the Air Force.  The government proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required item or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement within forty five days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  No solicitation document exists, therefore requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government?s only official notice of this procurement.  See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- Screening System to Detect Chemical and Biological Agents Inside Sealed Containers
<DESC>This synopsis was orginally posted to the Commerce Business Daily on 18 September 2001.  This is only a re-posting.  If you have already responded to the original request, do not submit another white paper.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is soliciting white papers for point-of-entry screening systems, or concepts which further the development of systems or elements of systems, to detect chemical and biological warfare agents (CWA/BWA) hidden in sealed containers.  US facilities and platforms, state-side and abroad, are potential targets of terrorist attack using CWA/BWA.  CWA/BWA, in a sealed container, could be concealed on a person, or within hand-carried articles, such as briefcases and bags.  It could be transferred into a facility through commercial mail or shipping channels, concealed within a shipping package and its other contents.  The required screening system will quickly and accurately inspect personnel, hand carried articles, and packages to detect CWA/BWAs prior to deployment, at the entry points to facilities and platforms, and without unduly interfering with normal business processes.  It is envisioned that the screening system would work in a manner similar to airport security systems which routinely screen passengers and luggage for illegal weapons, drugs, or other contraband.

It is anticipated that the Government will request a comprehensive technical and cost proposal for the most promising approach/concept identified by one or more white papers. The most promising proposal(s) may result in award of a contract for (1) a fixed-price feasibility study with (2) an option for a Not-to-Exceed (NTE) cost-plus-fixed-fee prototype development and demonstration effort. An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure subsequent award for either the feasibility study or the option.

The feasibility study will be six months in duration. The study shall refine and develop the proposed design concept for the CWA/BWA screening system and estimate the efficiency of the screening system CWA/BWA identification.  The study shall characterize the sensitivity, false alarm rate/frequency, and robustness of the CWA/BWA identification and identify and reduce areas of risk for future development. The results of the feasibility study shall provide an estimate of system size, weight, cost, risk, and a preliminary concept of operations. An outline plan and schedule shall be developed for the prototype development and demonstration effort, which may follow.  

At the conclusion of the feasibility study, the Government may request a full technical and cost proposal (within the NTE amount originally proposed) for the option for prototype development and demonstration effort.  (Proposal preparation costs will not be charged to the Government.)  A "down selection" to one or more of the best concepts, depending on evaluation of the proposal for the option, and availability of funds, may result in exercise of demonstration options, without further competition by the contractors.  The demonstration effort will develop a CWA/BWA screening system and build a proof of concept prototype to be tested, evaluated, and demonstrated.  The prototype will demonstrate the capabilities of the system with primary focus on reducing key risk areas for the system.  Contract awardees will be responsible for all aspects of work required to successfully develop proposed technologies into functioning prototypes, including fully testing and characterizing prototype performance against CWA/BWA simulants inside sealed containers.

All awards (for the feasibility effort or for the demonstration option) will require Contractors to submit monthly status reports.  A comprehensive report and out-brief will be required at the conclusion of the feasibility effort and the option, if exercised.  

WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION: White papers may propose novel sensor technologies, and innovative components or subsystems, which hold the potential of greatly improving the performance, or feasibility, of screening systems to identify BWA/CWA inside sealed containers. White papers must describe how the technology is expected to improve detection of CWA/BWAs inside sealed containers. White papers should provide sufficient information to demonstrate an understanding of the operational environment for use of a CWA/BWA screening system.  Any health or safety issues posed by the concept need to be identified. The level of maturity of the technology being proposed for the screening system should also be described.
