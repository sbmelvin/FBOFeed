<DESC>300-FF-2 EAST SIDE REMEDIATION

This work scope is for remedial actions required for the 300-8, 618-3, 618-8, and 618-2 (optional) waste sites.  It will involve the excavation of radioactive and hazardous soil and debris and the packaging of this material into shipping containers.  After loading, the containers will be sealed and placed in a transfer area for pickup by others.  Construction debris and process equipment may require size reduction prior to loading.  Miscellaneous waste such as drums, bottles, tanks or vessels may require repackaging and special handling prior to shipping.  Oversized debris may require size reduction to facilitate waste loading.  This work is considered to be hazardous in nature and will require personnel to have OSHA 40-hour and applicable radioactive worker training.  

The work includes performing remedial design and construction activities and furnishing necessary facilities, equipment, labor, materials, supplies, and tools.  It also includes engineering services to support preparation of  ”issued for construction’ (IFC) drawings to locate and detail the various waste sites and structures that may impact excavation activities, proposed support areas (e.g., laydown areas, support facilities, air monitors), and engineering support during field activities.  The work scope also includes upgrading and maintaining the existing container transfer area and haul road.

This work scope includes performance of operations necessary to excavate, sort, size reduce, stockpile, containerize, load, weigh, and transport material from the listed waste sites to the container transfer area.  This includes container tarping and maintenance, specialty packaging and maintenance (if necessary), stockpiling of below cleanup level materials and materials requiring treatment, on-site access control, and housekeeping.  In addition to contaminated soil, structural materials, metal debris, and other miscellaneous debris, this work scope include performance of operations and incidentals for the handling, processing, and staging of buried drums (if encountered), and industrial hygiene monitoring.  

A wide range of chemically and /or radiologically contaminated soil, miscellaneous debris, buried equipment, and structural materials may be encountered during remedial action activities.  Therefore, the successful Offeror shall have the appropriate experience and trained personnel to perform work operations in different levels of personal protective equipment, including supplied air for radiological, chemical, or general unknown conditions.

The estimated subcontract value for this work is between 4 and 6 million dollars.  Following award, mobilization, submittals, and readiness assessment, field work is anticipated to span between Fiscal Year 2005 and Fiscal Year 2007.
 
WASTE SITE DESCRIPTION

300-8 Aluminum Shavings Area

The 300-8 Aluminum Shavings Area is currently posted as a Soil Contamination Area.  The site consists of six irregularly shaped areas located along the railroad track north of the 300 Area.  The contamination areas are on both sides of the railroad track and separated by unposted dirt roads.  Aluminum metal shavings are scattered over the entire area.  Some of the metal was radiologically contaminated with low levels or uranium and beryllium.  Special precautions related to beryllium are required for this site.  

The site is considered ecologically sensitive due to the presence of oldgrowth sagebrush.  The sagebrush shall not be removed of damaged during remediation.  Monitoring of cleanup operations will be required in the areas of old-growth sagebrush and areas believed to contain a potential for undisturbed cultural deposits.

618-3 Burial Ground

The 618-3 Burial Ground is north of the 300 Area Exclusion Fence, adjacent to and west of the 618-2 Burial Ground.  The site is surrounded by 2 m (6.5 ft) high wooden poles with a chicken wire fence and two strands of barbed wire.  The area is posted as a Radiologically Controlled Area.  The site consists of uranium contaminated waste, primarily building materials from the remodeling of the 313 Building.  It may also contain waste from the 303-J and 303-K upgrades and waste materials from the construction of the 311 Facility.

618-8 Burial Ground

The 618-8 Burial Ground is located north of the 300 Area, beneath the 300 Area North Parking Lot and an extended area north of the parking lot.  The expanded area is delineated by post and chain.  The site is posted as a URMA.

Subsurface contamination was identified in the area when power poles were being installed.  The power poles and associated guy wires will be relocated by others prior to mobilization.  The SUBCONTRACTOR shall dispose of abandoned power poles above and below ground including associated buried guy anchors and cable.

The site was originally a disposal area for contaminated soil removed from the 303 Building perimeter.

618-2 Burial Ground (Optional Work)

The 618-2 Burial Ground is located north of the 333 Building on the north side of the 300 Area Exclusion Area.  The site is surrounded by 2 m (6.5 ft) high wooden poles with a chicken wire fence and two strands of barbed wire.  There is a metal gate at the north end.  The site is posted as a URMA.

The unit was used for disposal of uranium-contaminated equipment and materials, plutonium, and fission products.  The uranium waste was typically solid metallic uranium oxides in the form of metal cuttings from Reactor Fuel Fabrication facilities in the 300 Area.  The plutonium and fission products came from the 300 Area laboratory facilities.  The burial ground is expected to contain tin from the triple-dip canning process, lead from the lead dip process, and two dump truck loads of automobile batteries.  The burial ground was interim stabilized with 0.6 m (2 ft) of clean soil.

<DESC>Center of Excellence for Airliner Cabin Environment Research Notice of Public Information Meeting ACTION: Notice of a public information meeting for the Federal Aviation Administration Center of Excellence (COE) for Airliner Cabin Environment Research. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given for a public information meeting regarding technical proposals for the establishment of an FAA Center of Excellence for Airliner Cabin Environment Research. DATES: The meeting will be held on April 28, 2004, beginning at 10:00 am, anticipated closing at 3:00 pm ADDRESSES:  The meeting will be held in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AND EXACT LOCATION CONTACT: Patricia Watts, Ph.D., Director, FAA Air Transportation Centers of Excellence Program, FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, AAR-400, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ   08405, telephone (609) 485-5043, facsimile (609) 485-9430. NOTICE: The FAA will hold a public information meeting on April 28, 2004 to discuss the FAA research needs, procedures, and criteria for the selection of the FAA Center of Excellence for Airliner Cabin Environment Research. Questions and suggestions from attendees will be addressed at this meeting. Interested parties are encouraged, but not required, to attend the meeting. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The FAA intends to award a 50-50 cost share grant through a cooperative agreement to establish a COE for Airliner Cabin Environment Research at a qualified college or university. The cooperative agreement will be negotiated in 3-year increments up to a maximum of 10 years. It is the FAAâ€™s intent to fund a minimum of $2 million over the first three years. It is also the intent of the FAA to award a single-source indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to the winner(s) of the competition, under which orders may be placed for developmental products. The Center shall conduct research that includes the entire research spectrum (basic research through engineering development, prototyping, and testing) within the scope of Airliner Cabin Environment. This initial scope potentially includes, but is not limited to: development of cargo and cabin air quality sensors and sensor systems to detect potential environmental contaminants (chemical and/or biological); evaluation and definition of the distribution of chemical and biological contaminants in airliner cabins; investigation of the health effects of potential contaminants and other aspects of airliner cabin environments; performance of field and laboratory analysis of potential cabin and cargo contaminants; evaluation of potential methods to mitigate, control and eliminate the effect and/or spread of contaminants; and development of databases (with supporting architecture) for documentation of contaminants and contaminant incidents on commercial airliners. Research efforts may require extensive collaboration and cooperation with other organizations (industrial, academic and governmental) both within and outside of the COE.  The future scope of activities may be expanded to other aviation cargo and cabin environmental quality efforts such as large-scale application of sampling/analysis techniques in commercial aviation. As indicated in the enabling legislation, the successful offeror is required to match all FAA grant funds awarded to establish, operate, and conduct related research with non-federal funds over the term of the cooperative agreement.  Separate cost-sharing contracts may be awarded when deemed appropriate.  SELECTION CRITERIA: The COE will be selected primarily on technical merit and the ability of the team to meet the following criteria mandated by the enabling legislation, Public Law 101-508: - The extent to which the needs of the State in which the applicant is located are representative of the needs of the region for improved air transportation services and facilities - The demonstrated research and extension resources available to the applicant for carrying out the intent of the legislation - The capability of the applicant to provide leadership in making national and regional contributions to the solution of both long-range and immediate air transportation problems - The extent to which the applicant has an established air transportation program - The demonstrated ability of the applicant to disseminate results of air transportation research and educational programs through a statewide or region-wide continuing education program - The projects the applicant proposes to carry out under the grant    Potential projects will be defined during the informational meeting. Those persons wishing to attend this meeting are requested to register by COB April 19. To register or to obtain more information about the meeting, contact Patricia Watts by facsimile (609) 485-9430 or e-mail patricia.watts@faa.gov at the FAA Centers of Excellence Program Office.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for UM Analysis and Close Out activities for ED Tether Flight and Flight Hardware. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from The University of Michigan on a sole source basis.  The Space Physics Research Laboratory (SPRL)(a division of the University of Michigan)is presently working the return of flight hardware and ground support equipment for previous electrodynamic tether experiments.  This includes a tether endmass spacecraft, plasma diagnostics package with probes, and high-voltage tether current control and monitor.SPRL will complete analyses pertaining to the final version of this hardware and its suitability for flight.  SPRL will also complete technical performance analyses of bare electrodynamic tethers in high-speed plasma flow and assessing the impact of real-world ionospheric plasma variations on an operational bare tether structure. Bare ED tether technology is new and has not yet flown in space. Michigan has experience in assessing bare-tether operations based on computer simulations and ground tests. The technical expertise in bare wire anode collection research for spacebased tether even among universities is rare, but resides at the University of Michigan since their program has supported ProSEDS for several years. Lessons learned in these particular areas from the ProSEDS project are directly related to University of Michigan only. The Government intends to acquire a commercial service using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to  Janet Appleton via fax at 256-544-6062 no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 13, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not] acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>This is a synopsis for a commercial acquisition under FAR Parts 12 and 13.5 to procure equipment rental services and calibration and test gasses and other supplies in support of field tests to be conducted at Edwards AFB and Dugway Proving Grounds, Utah in June and August 2004.  The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to make award on a sole source basis to Tracer ES&T, Inc, San Marcos, CA on behalf of the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), Materials Directorate.  Services will be awarded as open-market incidental items under the authority of FAR 8.401(b) on a task order against the contractor’s GSA contract.  Services include rental of the following equipment: NO-NO2-NOx Analyzers (3ea, 1ppb detection limit), NOy Analyzers (3ea, 1ppb detection limit), SOx Analyzers (3ea, 1ppb detection limit), O3 Analyzers (3ea, 1ppb detection limit), CO Analyzer (1ea, 100ppb detection limit), UVA Sensor (1ea, 0-120 watts per sq meter),  UVB Sensor (1ea, 0-120 watts per sq meter), Data loggers (3ea), VOV/NMHC Samplers (50 ea), SF6 bag samplers (15 ea), Ozone Generator (3ea).  All analyzers with the exception of the UVA and UVB are required to meet EPA standard methods and protocols.  Supplies for use with this equipment are also being procured including the following support gasses: SF6 (various concentrations up to 50,000 ppt), CO, NO-NO2, SO2, and Zero Air.  This acquisition will be for equipment and supplies to support testing services that will be performed by Tracer ES&T.  The criticality of the tests requires that the contractor ensure that all equipment is calibrated and fully operational.  Equipment rented from an outside source would require the contractor to perform analysis and maintenance on the equipment in order to ascertain its condition.  In addition, the contractor must be familiar with the operating characteristics of the equipment, and be able to ensure that the various pieces of equipment are suitable to perform together and to perform to the requirements of the tests.  In addition the contractor must have the expertise to correct technical problems that occur with the equipment during the testing period.  Equipment rented from an outside source would not meet these requirements.  Tracer ES&T owns or maintains all critical equipment to be used for these tests.  The supplies are considered incidental to the equipment rentals.  It would not be cost effective to issue a separate contract for the procurement of these items.  Solicitation No.  F08650-04-R-0035 will be issued as a Request for Proposal for both the GSA services and the incidental equipment rentals and supplies being synopsized here.  This proposed procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.  It is advertised with a NAICS code for this acquisition is 334519 and Small Business size standard is 500 employees.  No solicitation documents exists at this time.  The 45th Contracting Squadron has determined that Tracer ES&T, Inc. is the only source capable of fulfilling this requirement.  Sources that feel they are capable of performing this effort should provide evidence of their capability prior to the closing date of this announcement.

FORM B
REQUEST FOR SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS

SOLICITATION NO.:  GS-03P-04-AZC-0015

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 04 should be submitted within 30 days of this publication; FY 05 by 1 Nov 04; and FY 06 by 1 Nov 05. White papers will be accepted until 5pm Eastern time 30 Sep 06, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate, Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) Program Office of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers for the design and development of JBI client adapters that enable C2 systems to connect to and interact within a JBI information space (reference the following US Air Force [USAF] Scientific Advisory Board’s "Report on Building the Joint Battlespace Infosphere Volume 1: Summary" for JBI concepts and definitions: http://www.rl.af.mil/programs/jbi/documents/JBIVolume1.pdf).  The objective of this BAA will be to explore innovative technical solutions and to design, develop and demonstrate prototype software components for integrating existing C2 applications into a JBI information space that supports future Net Centric Operations (NCO) infrastructures such as the Air Force’s ConstellationNet concept.  Critical to achieving this objective it to ascertain how a JBI information space and a collection of well-designed clients that utilize the information space can improve warfighter awareness, capabilities and interoperability without adversely impacting evolving C2 systems, data flow among these C2 systems, networks, common operating environments, and existing concepts of operation.

A JBI is an interoperable information space which aggregates, integrates, fuses, and intelligently disseminates relevant battlespace information to support decision-making at all echelons of a Joint Task Force (JTF), delivering "Decision Quality" information to the warfighter. It is intended to serve as an integrating substrate upon which legacy and emerging systems can be linked together to support transparent information exchange across the full spectrum of mission activities and functional domains.

One of the primary goals of the JBI is to take initial steps in developing an information interoperability infrastructure that connects disparate software applications or "clients," and facilitates information exchange between these clients creating a cohesive combat information management system.  Another goal of the JBI is to integrate existing C2 systems within an information space without replacing these systems.  To that end, this BAA will provide the design considerations, software components and technical know-how to integrate pertinent existing C2 clients within an information space developed by AFRL known as the JBI Reference Implementation (RI).

This BAA will be executed as a shared management program in conjunction with the Air Force Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Center (AFC2ISRC).  The AFC2ISRC is the lead organization to integrate and influence C2ISR for the USAF, and under this effort, will produce operational concepts and scenarios and recommend areas for JBI technology insertion where it: (1) makes the most operational sense; (2) maximizes warfighter utility; and (3) provides an initial integration substrate for legacy C2 developers to consider as an option for achieving inter-system interoperability.  The AFC2ISRC will also generate written operational assessments that evaluate BAA and AFRL deliverables and address validation of concepts and technologies within the context of real-world scenarios.

For all contracts under this BAA, AFRL/IF will provide the following after contract award: (1) the evolving JBI RI; [see V1.1CoreServices.pdf for current version information and InHouseFeatures.pdf  for future version information] (2) Java and web services programming language mapping to the JBI Common Client Application Program Interface (CAPI) that provides access to the RI; (see http://www.infospherics.org/ for details on the CAPI) (3) the evolving information object model that defines the base XML schema definition for some JBI information objects exchanged or manipulated during this effort; (4) a subset of relevant data link messages that should be represented as JBI information objects with embedded hierarchy, metadata schema, and payload information as information engineering deliverables; and (5) integration and integration support activities to connect the individual software components and approaches developed by all parties under this effort within the context of common scenarios and demonstration threads.

Contractors shall work with AFRL as concept and prototype component software designers and developers and shall provide integration support of their C2 client adapter concepts/components among specified C2 systems and between the JBI RI to achieve stated objectives.  Final demonstrations will be conducted at one or more Government facilities.  Several scenarios and targeted operational domains shall be considered during the period of performance and will be guided by input from AFC2ISRC.  One of the first scenarios potential offerors can consider is the Data Link Automated Reporting System (DLARS), an on-going C2 Battle Laboratory (C2BL) program and JEFX 04 initiative.

DLARS was established to overcome several operational deficiencies, including: (1) the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) only has visualization of aircraft "track" data; (2) aircraft data including target and weapons status is not retained or displayed; (3) there is no means for the CAOC to see and analyze mission strike status in near-real time; (4) and there is no means of receiving mission reports (MISREPs) in a timely manner.  The DLARS solution to these problems is to (1) automatically capture pertinent mission data available on datalinks; (2) validate accuracy of the captured information; and (3) make this data available for use by multiple users.   DLARS receives relevant Link-16 data and USMTF messages (MISREPs, OPSTASKLINK), correlates the data with the mission data resident in Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS) databases, aggregates new data relevant to the mission, stores this data back into new TBMCS data tables, and provides an enhanced view of the overall air campaign with actionable information.

Since DLARS is an on-going effort, AFC2ISRC is looking for an alternate and complementary approach of providing data that traditionally resides on datalink networks as information to a larger community of warfighters.  Recent lessons learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) has shown that much critical data falls on the floor and is not disseminated as useful information to those who could use it.  On the heels of several years of intense research and development, AFRL has developed initial JBI core services and begun to address complicated core and client fielding issues.  This is an opportune time for AFC2ISRC to evaluate and influence two approaches that address the DLARS problem.  From a JBI perspective, the initial approach is to provide a flexible infrastructure in which client components and applications can be strategically placed to support the flow of mission "folder" information to the Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT) operators (see Figure 1).  Thereafter, it will be relatively easy to assemble and add new components that either augment existing or provide new capabilities without requiring inflexible Interface Control Documents (ICD).  Note that Figure 1 shows the integration of three of five types of components defined in paragraph (3) that could be developed to meet DLARS requirements and should be considered a potential and not exclusive set.

Potential offerors can either directly address DLARS (sub-) issues, establish a process for interacting with and influencing additional scenario development, recommend additional scenarios and corresponding approaches, or a combination thereof.  In any case, potential offerors will need to perform a subset of the following tasks:  

(1)	Identify and document concepts, techniques and technologies for integrating existing USAF or Joint/Coalition C2 systems/applications into a JBI information space with minimal impact to the operation of these systems and no impact to the operator/warfighter.  Systems and applications at all levels of the C2 command hierarchy from the actual platform carrying out a mission/task to the Combatant Commander dictating strategies and tactics will be considered

 
(2)	Identify and document transition opportunities and strategies for JBI core services and C2 client adapters to meet C2 warriors’ needs.  Describe approaches that balance the co-evolution of C2 concepts and technologies in a manner that addresses critical accreditation, common operating environment, security, survivability, operation over unreliable communication links, system administration, long-term maintenance and other issues that plague designers of to-be-fielded C2 systems.  Key to any successful transition of JBI technologies will be the realization that there will be no "cut-over date" when C2 systems will be using the JBI substrate as the primary means of interoperability.  Rather, the transition will occur gradually and will only happen, if at each phase, the JBI core and clients maintain a low profile/footprint with minimal overhead, yet provides added value to the warfighter.  Added value is defined as either providing operators access to information or capability they never had before or providing better machine-to-machine interface flexibility and/or affordability than an existing interface governed by a rigid and costly ICD; or both.

(3)	Design, develop, test, integrate and demonstrate C2 legacy client adapter components that form an information bridge between true legacy applications/systems and the JBI RI.  Depending upon the scenario; targeted warfighter domain; participating legacy C2 systems, applications, nodes and platforms; demonstration location; and capabilities of the JBI RI, the following types of C2 legacy client adapter components may be assembled:

a.	Embedded Components.  Resides on a military platform such as an aircraft or vehicle, maintains a low software footprint and is strategically "wrapped" as another on-board feature that meets platform processing, look and feel (graphical or other presentation), weight restrictions and other stringent guidelines subject to accreditation.  The embedded component shall communicate with other C2 nodes and data link gateways via standard tactical communication links.
b.	C2 Node Components.  Resides on more capable military platforms that act as C2 nodes (AWACS, JSTARS, or their ground stations etc) or fixed, large C2 installations that have adequate bandwidth and access to a JBI configuration.  These components speak JBI and act as proxies for the more disadvantaged embedded components.  C2 node components can aggregate or selectively control data flow to embedded components based on information exchanged within a JBI.  They can also interact with either the data or information link side of the gateway components depending upon their task.
c.	Data Link-Information Link Gateway Components.  These components act as translators, filters or aggregators between publishers/subscribers in a data link network and publishers/subscribers in an information link network.  Consider a subscriber on an Information Link (JBI information space) who needs access to information whose ultimate source produced by a node on a Link-16 network.  In this example, a subscription on a JBI Information Link should theoretically be translated to a subscription on a data link and once received via data link subscription, properly translated and published to the information link for the JBI subscriber and other JBI consumers.
d.	JBI-Legacy Client Components.  If processing power is available, add-on development is feasible, and the client application software can still be compliant in a common operating environment (e.g., Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment [DII/COE] or others) despite JBI client requirements, then JBI-Legacy client components would be preferred.  These client components should integrate seamlessly into the host application and its underlying infrastructure.
e.	Native JBI Client Components.  Brand new components to showcase JBI infrastructure capabilities that either are not concerned with specific run-time environment restrictions, or other compliance issues, and are generally assumed to demonstrate a new capability not in a legacy system’s arsenal.

(4)	For any specialized embedded software, hardware, networking or communications links that are proposed, it is up to the potential offerors to outline additional requirements to make demonstrations successful.  For example, if a JTIDS terminal is required in which a small software process would be embedded to act as a datalink-infolink gateway client, document it, state the costs, and be cognizant of the fact that some demonstration locations will not have direct line of sight (LOS) to the JTIDS in the sky.  If it is better to acquire or have access to datalink simulators, clearly describe your (and AFRL’s) acquisition approach and any upfront costs.  If you propose an embedded component that would provide an F15-E pilot a window into the JBI onboard the aircraft, describe your approach for "wrapping" the component and what other Government agencies AFRL/IF would need to coordinate with to ensure success.  If you believe you have a complete end-to-end solution involving the aforementioned components in a variety of platforms and command hierarchies, you should clearly state any proprietary components and any limitations (cost or otherwise) associated with production or fielding of your proposed solution.  In all cases, potential offerors should identify how they would interact with other Contractors awarded tasks under this effort in the absence of formal Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA).

Under this Coalition and Advanced Information Technology Integration and Operations Support bridge contract, HAI will continue to provide network and systems administration; software and applications systems operations; demonstration and management services support; as well as to operate, administer, maintain, manage and demonstrate networks, systems, and services to assist with the transitioning of them to Government agencies.

Proposals submitted against that solicitation are currently being evaluated.

The requirement is being acquired sole source based on the fact that SETA developed the system and soliciting from sources unfamiliar with the system is not in the best interest of the government.  Award date is expected to be on or about 9 April 04.   This will be a firm-fixed price award.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>S -- Privatization of Natural Gas Distribution System and Wastewater Collection System at Luke Air Force Base, AZ
<SOLNBR>SP0600-04-R-0045
<RESPDATE>011504

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the natural gas infrastructure system at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility system being privatized is described as follows: Installation: Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. System Description: Natural Gas.  The base size is approximately 4,524,064 square feet, it has 365 buildings and 874 military family housing units which the Air Force controls. Gila Bend Airfield is 65 miles southwest of Phoenix, AZ. It has 40 buildings and 180,065 square feet, which the Air Force controls. Fort Tuthill is 135 miles north of Phoenix, AZ. It has 31 buildings and 44,119 square feet, which the Air Force controls. At each location, the utilities to be possibly privatized are the natural gas distribution system and the wastewater collection system. Luke Air Force Base has it’s own wastewater treatment plant. Although the systems shall be evaluated individually, privatization shall combine and group as many systems as is feasible under a single RFP. The natural gas distribution system is supplied to Luke Air Force Base at three separate locations by 175 pound per square inch gauge gas mains owned by Southwest Gas Corporation. The natural gas piping on the main base is almost entirely polyethylene (PE). Steel piping is located in the Military Family Housing area. The piping is coated, rather than wrapped, and includes a cathodic protection system. The system contains 19 rectifiers. There is no physical on-base production of gas or natural gas wells. The meters owned by the Air Force are used for billing purposes. The Air Force-owned distribution system consists of approximately 119,000 linear feet of underground piping. The majority of the piping is less than 20 years old, with some as old as 50 years. Gila Bend Airfield: Three one thousand-gallon propane tanks owned by the propane supplier, Amerigas Inc. supply propane gas to Gila Bend Airfield. The tanks store propane at 100 psig. Propane gas is delivered to the lodge at 12.5 psig, and to the Fire Department at 10 psig. Fort Tuthill Recreation Area: Propane gas is supplied to Ft. tuthill Recreation Area at two each, one thousand-gallon propane tanks owned by the propane supplier, All Star Gas, Inc. The Air Force-owned piping consists of approximately 1250 feet of piping. The tanks store propane at approximately 100 psig. Distribution is at 5 psig. Wastewater collection system: The sanitary sewer system at Luke Air Force Base (AFB) consists of three major components, the sanitary sewer collection system, the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and non-potable water reuse system. The sanitary sewer system consists of the gravity mains, cleanouts, lift stations, force mains, and access manholes associated with the collection of sanitary sewer form the facility buildings and family housing on the base. A majority of the gravity collection mains and service laterals were installed in the 1940’s when the base was first constructed and in the 1950’s and 1960’s. The gravity collection mains installed during these construction periods are composed primarily of Reinforced Concrete Pipe (RCP), the force mains are Cast Iron (CI) and the service laterals are Vitrified Clay Pipe (VCP).  In the 1970’s, additional base housing was installed. The gravity collection mains installed during these construction periods are composed primarily of Reinforced Concrete Pipe (RCP), the force mains are Cement Mortar Lined Ductile Iron (DI), and the service laterals are Vitrified Clay Pipe (VCP). Since the 1980’s, the base has made a concerted effort to install PVC for all sanitary sewer piping of sizes 8-inchesa or less. Consequently, most of the gravity mains, force mains and service laterals in these areas are composed of PVC. A majority of the gravity collection mains, force mains and service laterals installed in the 1940’s, 1950’s and 1960’s are in fair to good condition. A majority of the gravity collection mains, force mains and service laterals installed during the 1970’s, 1980’s and 1990’s are in good to excellent condition. The WWTP is designed to all the sanitary flow from the sanitary sewer collection system through a 21” RCP main gravity line flowing from the site. Major improvements were conducted in 1994 to provide an advanced wastewater treatment plant which consistently met effluent discharge limitations and provided reuse water for discharge to the base golf course and parks for irrigation purposes. Improvements were designed to allow the facility to effectively treat an average daily flow of 1.0 million gallons per day (1.0MGD) with removal efficiencies in excess of 95% or better for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and suspended solids. The WWTP has a certified laboratory capable of performing both process control and process monitoring tests. Since most of the WWTP equipment was installed or reconstructed in the 1994 improvements, its overall condition is good to excellent. Gila Bend Airfield: The sanitary sewer system at Gila Bend Airfield consists of service laterals, cleanouts, oil/water separators, lift stations, gravity mains, force mains, and access manholes associated with the collection of sanitary sewer from the facility buildings on the base. The collected sanitary wastewater is transferred to a central treatment system that was installed in 1970. The gravity collection system consists of primarily Vitrified Clay Pipe (VCP) mains with VCP or Cast Iron Pipe (CIP) laterals. Approximately 90% of the system was installed in the 1970’s. In the 1990’s, a small portion of the original mains and laterals were replaced with Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) piping. The treatment system consists of a manually cleaned bar screen, influent Parshall flume and four lagoons designed for 125,000 gallons per day. The treatment system has an NPDES permit and is permitted for discharge. Lagoons No.1 and No.2 have liners that require repairs; however, Lagoon No.3 and Lagoon No.4 do not have liners. Fort Tuthill Recreation Area: The sanitary sewer system at Fort Tuthill Recreation Area consists of service laterals, cleanouts, lift stations, gravity mains, junction boxes and access manholes associated with the collection of sanitary sewage. The collected sanitary wastewater is transferred to a central septic system, which was installed in the 1960’s. The gravity collection system consists of primarily Vitrified Clay Pipe (VCP) mains with VCP or Cast Iron Pipe (CIP) laterals with Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) mains and laterals installed in later additions. The treatment system consists of a lift station, a 20,000-gallon storage tank, septic tank and lateral field designed for 12,000 gallons per day. The lift station contains a wet well, two (2) pumps, float type level controls and a control panel with a Hand-Off-Auto switch for local manual pump control. In 1996, the pumps were replaced with new submersible grinder pumps. See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  The cascading source selection method permits small and large businesses to submit offers.  Offers from small businesses will be considered first. In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for award to a small business concern are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns. Interested sources shall contact Bobby Jones at 703-767-2397 to be added to our bidder mailing list.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>GEOSPATIAL REPRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS, SOL BAA04-12, Addendum 2, DUE 062504, POC: DR. CAREY SCHWARTZ, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4536. Email: baa04-12@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/. The Defense Sciences Office is interested in new proposals in GEOSPATIAL REPRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS (GEO*).  Geo* has an emphasis on the development of mathematics and algorithms that enable parsimonious and compact representations of Geospatial Representation and Analysis coupled to end user applications such as image to digital elevation modeling, targeting, route planning, and motion mobility simulations.  This new program represents a major thrust area for DSO that will comprise a multidisciplinary, multi-pronged approach with far reaching impact. Geospatial Representation and Analysis: The Department of Defense makes considerable use of geospatial information, particularly in the form of digital terrain elevation models and the variation of the earth’s gravitational field.  In turn these data sets are used to support a number of functions including but not limited to route planning, mission planning, navigation, targeting, visualization, and mission rehearsal.  A key observation is that both the digital terrain elevation model and the variation of the earth’s gravitational field are geometric surfaces that we are attempting to model to a specified precision and accuracy.  Typically the variation of gravity is represented by a spherical harmonic expansion while digital elevation models are modeled as a post on a grid with a height attached to each post.  In both cases, the nature of the representation introduces errors.   The nature of the representation used to store the model introduces additional difficulties including the need to support applications with variable spatial resolution and spatial accuracy from a single common database.  The nature of the representations themselves also create difficulties with regard to the operations of conflating and deflating the database as new data is obtained.  This is particularly acute for gravitational field models based upon spherical harmonics that, when updated with local data, force global updates of the model.  Furthermore the structure of the database impacts the techniques by which the database is searched and the time required to complete the search.  The Department of Defense operates over large geographic regions implying the need for large databases.   Schemes to compress the data, including lossless and lossy compression, are desirable provided they preserve the utility of the underlying data for the purposes of calculating gradients that in turn are used in visibility calculations, motion mobility models, route planning, and radar placements. A common primitive function that is difficult to enable in a precise, timely fashion is the registration of imagery obtained from a sensor to the underlying digital elevation model and the direct construction of a digital elevation model from in theater imaging sensors.  This problem is difficult because the geospatial position of the sensor is not known precisely, the pointing angles of the sensor on the platform is not known precisely, and the camera model of the sensor may not be fully known.  The difficulty of registering an image to an existing digital elevation model or the construction of image mosaics is further exacerbated by the use of methods that are not invariant with respect to the spatial quantization of the image, contrast and illumination, require extensive and accurate a priori knowledge, or rely on human beings to select tie points or common features in pairs of images.   This leads to systems that have unpredictable run times, operator dependent errors and accuracies.   The effect of errors in the underlying digital elevation model itself, errors associated with the compression and restoration of the database, as well as intermediate processes such as registration of images to the database introduce uncertainties into client applications such as targeting, route planning, visibility, and radar placements that must be quantified in order to enable improved decision making. 
We would like to invite white papers that are far reaching in their implications, innovative, and ambitious in their goals and implementation.  We encourage the submission of white papers that address one or more of the following areas: (1) New representations for surface and geodetic data that support conflation and deflation that also lead to a 100X improvement in storage of a digital elevation model at a density of a digital elevation model with post spacing of 0.3m relative to JPEG with at a minimum of no additional loss of precision in an end user application and a desired improvement of 10x in accuracy relative to JPEG, such as targeting, route planning, or the calculation of visibility when the calculation is performed using a JPEG compressed database.   At a minimum the representations and compression schemes must support lossy compression that simultaneously preserves height and gradient information and provide a strategy for preserving information as required by other end user applications; (2) Local vice global representations of geodetic data providing storage reduction of 100x relative to spherical harmonic expansions with local controllable error that support conflation and deflation without recomputation of the complete representation as new data becomes available; 
(3) New mathematical methods with analysis tools for automated registration of images to images that enable image stabilization, frame integration, passive moving target indication, and three dimensional model building with appropriate metrics and accuracy.  The primary sensor modalities of interest are monochromatic images derived from infrared and visible sensors, video, ladar range, ladar intensity, multispectral, and hyperspectral imagery.  We are discouraging efforts that will register images derived from radars.  The associated analysis should provide quantified errors in terms of pixels that, if given a camera model, would enable estimation of the registration error on the ground.   The methods to be developed must be capable of automatic operation and support projective transformations between the images as well meeting the requirement of provable contrast invariance and illumination invariance. At the end of the program this capability must be capable of operating at 60 Hz with images that are 512 x 512 with 12 bits/pixel; (4) New mathematical methods with analysis tools for automated registration of images to digital point position databases that will perform the registration to the left and right member at a frame rate of 30 Hz with appropriate metrics and accuracy and to geospatial representations with an accuracy equivalent to the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency proposed definitions of DTED 4, 5, or 6 or 3m, 1m, or 0.3m respectively  The primary sensors of interest are monochromatic images derived from infrared and visible sensors, video, ladar range, ladar intensity, multispectral, and hyperspectral imagery.  We are discouraging efforts that will register images derived from radars.  Authors of white papers may make the following assumptions in order to guide the development of their effort.  The image will be composed of pixels that correspond to 0.5m, 1m and 5m on the ground in an orthographic representation; the image is either 256 x 256 pixels or 512 x 512 pixels; and that the footprint of the image on the ground is initially known to within 0.5 km.   The algorithm and associated analysis should provide quantified errors in terms of pixels so that if a camera model is supplied, the algorithm would enable estimation of the registration error on the ground and produce sub pixel registration accuracy.   The methods to be developed must be capable of automatic operation and support projective transformations between the image and the reference database as well as meeting the requirement of provable contrast invariance and illumination invariance. At the end of the program this capability must be capable of operating at 60 Hz with images that are 512 x 512 with 12 bits/pixel; (5) New representations for rapid storage retrieval that enable techniques that would allow “Image Search and Retrieval by Image” in the absence of text annotation of the images where one of the images has been subjected to a perspective or projective transform as well as contrast or illumination changes relative to the stored database.  At the end of the program this capability should be capable of operating at 60 Hz with images that are 512 x 512 with 12 bits/pixel; (6) New representations for rapid storage and retrieval that would enable rapid search and retrieval of lines of iso-height as well as enable queries for heights between specified bounds that are compatible with multi-resolution methods and require only a single pass through the stored database.  The algorithms to be developed must be compatible with a concept of operations that includes a single database supporting multiple users each of which has a different resolution requirement.  For the purposes of algorithm development, authors may assume an initial database with a post spacing 0.3m supporting clients with operational requirements equivalent to a digital elevation model with post spacing of 30m, 10m, 3m, 1m, or 0.3m. WHITE PAPER REQUIREMENTS. White papers may include any combinations of the above areas.  We strongly discourage white papers that focus on the design of new sensors or data collection efforts.  We encourage the formation of interdisciplinary teams integrated toward solutions to these challenging problems.

The U.S. Department of Commerce has a requirement  to provide support to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)/Non-Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) Cooperative Program.  BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION  - The United States assists the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic countries, Central Europe Countries, and other countries to assume the full responsibility for preventing the proliferation of equipment and technologies that could be used in the development or delivery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with other U.S. Government agencies, works with these countries in establishing fair and effective national export control systems. The BIS/Non Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) group has been working in cooperative outreach programs with export control organizations in these countries since 1994. The level and scope of NEC’s outreach efforts have increased due to the growing concerns of the U.S. Government regarding the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems. For example, in FY 2003, NEC conducted more than double the number of technical exchange activities from the previous year (approximately 75 - 95). This has required NEC to restructure its contract mechanisms and redefine the roles and relationships between federal staff and contract support staff. Historically, the NEC group requires contractor support in the areas of: TRAINING DEVELOPMENT – The contractor shall work under the direction of the NEC group to identify training modules for development in order to meet the requirements of particular cooperating countries. These modules augmented the existing NEC training material originally established as part of the NEC Course Curriculum. These training materials satisfy learning objectives that are established by NEC in a model country plan. The appropriate mix of instructional methods and delivery approaches (e.g. lecture, role-play, simulations group discussions) was evaluated and integrated into the training material to meet the learning objectives. The Contractor shall maintain a technical library of Government-owned course material, program books, and other materials which is Government property. The library shall allow access to previously developed training material, agendas, and presentations (electronic and hard copy form) for use in planning future programs.  TRAINING DELIVERY AND DEPLOYMENT – The Contractor shall deliver training courses to export control officials and experts in cooperating countries in the various export control areas (e.g. legal, regulatory, licensing, control lists, industry/Government relations, export enforcement). These courses are to be delivered in the US in a government owned facility to foreign delegations from participating countries. The contractor is also to deliver training workshops, seminars and conferences in foreign locations. For both the foreign and domestic training delivery activity, the Contractor shall be responsible for organizing the material, arranging for translation, and coordinating speakers from within the Department of Commerce, other U.S. Government agencies and U.S. industry. Program books shall be built and reproduced for the technical exchanges/seminars and copies of course materials shall be provided to the foreign trainees. In order to ensure the most widespread use of the training material and software training tools within the client country, the contractor shall, at times, provide specific hardware such as computers, zip drives or other computer peripherals.  NEC is interested in exploring creative strategies for the delivery of training materials.  MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL EXCHANGES - Many times a year, the NEC group works with cooperating Governments and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) to sponsor export control conferences on a variety of topics. These conferences can be specific to the host country or can be regional in nature. In order to effectively manage these conferences, the Contractor shall established business relationships with the conference hosts who have in turn handled the local logistics including venue, speakers, program material, simultaneous interpretation, and other miscellaneous support activities. As a co-sponsor of these conferences, the NEC group will often ensure a US presence at the conferences. The Contractor shall work with the NEC group to identify and prepare U.S. Industry participants who will be part of the US delegation to the conference. MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM DEPLOYMENTS -As a result of efforts since 1994, the NEC group has made significant progress with cooperating Governments in building export control institutions. In particular, as the cooperating country’s export control systems are developed, the need to have good industry and Government cooperation has become apparent. In the field of industry-Government relations, the contractor developed software tool, the Internal Control Program (ICP), shall be modified and adapted to the regulatory environment of specific cooperating countries. The ICP tool establishes a framework for the foreign industry to comply with its own Government’s export control regulations and meet international standards regarding control of strategic commodities. The Contractor shall work with the export control agency or its designated NGO to establish a plan to modify and deploy these country specific versions of the ICP tool. Efforts shall be made to encourage all countries to adopt all 10 elements of the generic ICP model, but the ultimate product shall be a function of the cooperating country’s specific export control law and regulations. A rapid series of ICP deployments have taken place in Russia, Ukraine, and a select set of Central European countries. Based on the number and geographical diversity of the foreign enterprises, the Contractor shall be required to handle some deployments independently of the NEC group. LOGISTICS SUPPORT  - In the course of conducting the international training program, both in the US and abroad, the contractor shall  plan and manage logistics for both US and foreign nationals for ticketing, billeting, conference facility management, and ground transportation.  OTHER ACTIVITIES - Based on the number of countries and the expanding scope of activities under the NEC outreach programs, the NEC group may require the Contractor to perform other unique tasks as they arise. These requirements may be generated by outside agencies such as State and Defense Departments who are trying to coordinate their activities with the NEC group. NEC envisions a greater contractor role in the continuous planning for fiscal year budget submissions based on medium to long-range strategic goals and in planning, scheduling and implementing short-term (one year) operation plans. NAICS Code: 541611. Size Standard: $6.0. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  HOWEVER, IT WILL CONTAIN THE PROVISIONS OF A CASCADING SET-ASIDE PREFERENCE WHICH PUT LARGE BUSINESSES ON NOTICE THAT, IF THE AGENCY RECEIVES A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESS OFFERS, LARGE BUSINESS PROPOSALS RECEIVED SIMPLY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.  Proposals must include business size, Federal Taxpayer Identification Number, and Dun and Bradstreet Number. All contractors interested in this requirement must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). As of October 1, 2003, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR.

Prospective firms interested in participating in this procurement should review the revised version of the notice carefully before providing their submission. It will also be noted that the submissions are still due on April 6, 2004. Accordingly, the original synopsis, dated March 23, 2004, is hereby deleted in its entirety and in its place is the following in lieu thereof:

The following is the contract for which you may apply and this information must appear on the outside of your package: Solicitation #HSFE05-04-R-0001.  Submittals by facsimile transmission will not be accepted and will be considered non-responsive. All contracts are to be capped at $30,000,000 over the life of the contract, which is one (1) base year with 4 option years.  The minimum amount for each contract will be $50,000 over the life of the contract. This procurement is unrestricted competition and is classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541330.  The small business size is (not to exceed) $4 million. If one or more large businesses are selected for contract award, they must comply with FAR 52.219-9 (Small Business Subcontracting Plan) and HSAR 3019.705-1 (Small Business Subcontracting Program). The Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not required with the initial submittal, but will be required with the second phase of the selection process prior to contract negotiations. The anticipated contract type will be Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Service Contract with Performance-Based Task Orders.  Task Orders may be firm fixed price, cost reimbursable or cost plus award fee. Only Firms who have an accounting system meeting the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) standards will be given consideration for contract award.   To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). You may register via the internet at www.ccr.gov.

Services: The services to be provided include the compilation of Flood Insurance Study (FIS) data, Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) data, disaster recovery maps in Region V States and technical assistance related to joint mapping activities initiated under the Cooperating Technical Partner initiatives. Generally, assignments initiated under these Task Orders will be completed within a twelve (12) month period. The selected firm(s) may be required to provide all or some of the services as stated in Attachment A: Statement of Objectives.

(See evaluation factors below.) A performance based solution to meet the Statement of Objectives shall be requested from only those firms who are on the “short list”. DUE DILIGENCE sessions will be part of this procurement for only those firms notified that they are on the “short list”. The Due Diligence Library is available now. These sessions will be held in the FEMA Region V offices in Chicago (by appointment only) prior to the date for solution submittal estimated to be approximately April 26, 2004. The library may be accessed through www.fema.gov/regions/v/mit/idiq_due_diligence_library.shtm. Expenses for the solution preparation or for the due diligence process will not be reimbursed. Joint ventures must include a copy of the legal venture agreement signed by an authorized officer of each entity identified and must list the percentage and type of work that will be performed by each participating firm and state that this is a joint venture. Item Five (5) of the SF 255 must be completed in full for the venture to be considered. Only one (1) SF 255 shall be submitted for joint ventures. USE STANDARD PAGES OF THE SF 254 and 255 (Rev. 11/92) prescribed. All firms shall submit one (1) copy of the SF 254 and 255 in order to be considered.

Additionally, key staff submitted shall not be changed after award without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. In the event the selected firm(s) decides to utilize other personnel in the performance of the Task Order(s) for this contract, submit their resumes to the Contracting Officer for approval. The qualifications of the substituted personnel must be equal to or better than those of the person that they are replacing. In Block 8, in addition to the ten (10) projects, attach the two examples of performance accomplishments as requested in Factor 4 (Past Performance). Item 10 of the SF 255 shall be limited to one (1) single sided page, also using standard 12-point type size. It should include a brief presentation of internal controls and procedures that you use to insure that a quality product is produced. All other material such as brochures and samples of work will not be considered and will be discarded upon receipt. 

Selection Process: Firms will be selected using procedures for acquisition of Architect-Engineer services set forth in FAR, Part 36 and the Brooks Act, 40 USC #5 (1988) as amended. The “Selection Criteria” will be in accordance with FAR, Section 36.602-1 “Selection Criteria”. If a firm has multiple offices, for each of the criteria requiring demonstrated abilities and experience, submit project experience for each specific office and list the personnel in the office who would be assigned to perform the work. The selection process will be accomplished in two (2) phases: (Phase 1) Review, rating and ranking of the SF 254 and SF 255. Those firms rated as most highly qualified in the first phase will be notified and requested to submit their solutions for fulfilling the Statement of Objectives. The solution package shall include the Program Management Plan, Technical Work Plan, Quality Assurance Plan and Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

The firm may be requested to provide additional information or clarification concerning their solution. The opportunity to revise your solution may be provided after these discussions.  Firms selected for consideration of an IDIQ contract will be notified. Negotiations will be conducted beginning with the most preferred firm(s) in the selection, and will proceed until an award or awards are made or all of the short-listed firms have been rejected. Responses shall reference “Synopsis Number HSFE05-04-R-0001” on the face of both the SF 254 and SF 255 as well as the outside of the envelope.

<DESC>This modification is to correct the title to Liquid and Gas Components.

Research and Development Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI):  The Naval Center for Space Technology at the Naval Research Lab is seeking sources for liquid and gas components to build and test a spacecraft propulsion system that will be operated with gases and cleaning fluids on the ground, and with hypergolic rocket propellants in space. Examples of items needed include, but are not limited to, the following: solenoid and latching valves, pressure tanks, propellant tanks, propellant lines and fittings, fill and test valves, ordnance activated valves, thrusters, custom machined brackets, pressure test components including valves, gauges, regulators, flexible hoses, hazardous propellant protection equipment, welding equipment, pumps, vacuum and leak detection equipment, analysis software, cleanroom equipment and cleaning products, and certified materials such as cleaning fluid, propellants, and raw metallic materials. The flight hardware requires both high reliability and special care in assembly that is associated with reliable spacecraft equipment. The vendor for such flight hardware shall use, when specified, detailed and fully documented processes and procedures (e.g., welding, cleaning) to define all of the materials, fluids, manufacturing steps, inspections, and quality assurance processes used in designing, developing, manufacturing, testing, and delivering the item. All such processes and procedures shall be made available to the customer for review and approval prior to beginning manufacturing operations. Vendor’s ability to meet stringent time constraints and rigid schedules will be a primary consideration.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a request for proposals and a solicitation is not available at this time. Interested vendors must submit a statement of capabilities and a summary of work performed with a list of customers.

A.  INTRODUCTION.

THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT.

The High Power Microwaves High Power Systems Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the development of technologies, components, and systems for High Power Microwave and other directed energy systems via this Directed Energy Technology Applications and Research (DETAR) program.  The DETAR program intends to develop and enhance present capabilities as well as expand the horizons and search for new opportunities in all aspects of high power microwave (HPM) system and technology development.  The program will provide technology and applications research and development (R&D) for pulsed power (PP) and HPMs, making optimum use of AFRL/DEH capital resources, facilities, and experience.  This should include, but is not necessarily limited to, R&D on narrow band and wide band HPM loads; associated compact, portable pulsed power supplies suitable to drive such loads, including repetitive pulsed power supplies; alternative uses of such technology such as high energy particle beams; higher current and energy pulsed power and its applications, such as intense ionizing radiation sources, hypervelocity projectiles, material jets, and particulate beams; and other innovative developments of and use of pulsed power.

In making full use of capital assets located on Kirtland AFB, NM, the contractor is expected to provide R&D maintenance and management of several Kirtland AFB, NM facilities.  Sites and buildings housing these assets include the High Energy Plasma Laboratory (Building 322), The High Energy Microwave Laboratory (HEML, Building 323), the High Energy Research and Technology Facility (HERTF, Building 66071), portions of Sandia Area 4 used by AFRL/DE (Building 963), portions of buildings in the Building 900 complex, and a new facility located on KAFB housing operations presently conducted at Sandia Area IV. The pulse power systems contained in these facilities include modular capacitor systems capable of storing several mega joules, and delivering up to 20 megamps with flexible timing, and triggering of separate modules (e.g., SHIVA-STAR).   As part of this program, contractors will be expected to offer a significant and comprehensive facilities maintenance and operations program encompassing all operational, safety, and health aspects.

The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $25-49.9M over five years (FY05: $5-9.5M; FY06: $5-10M; FY07: $5-9.5M; FY08: $5-10M; FY09: $5-10.9M), and the resulting contract will be awarded with a ceiling of $49.9M.  This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period.  AFRL reserves the right to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards.  This includes the possibility of making more than one award within a given topic area.  If multiple awards within a topic area do occur, contractors may have to compete with each other for a given task order.  If competed, AFRL will evaluate task order proposals on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  technical merit, affordability, and previous performance on the contract.  AFRL then will evaluate, for realism and reasonableness, the cost proposal of the contractor selected for negotiation.

Technical Task Areas are described below.

1.  High Power Microwave Development:  

Preliminary results of the probability and effects testing and scenario modeling has indicated that HPM source power levels greater than 1 GW are of interest for the DETAR program, consistent with antenna gain and distance from target.  The thrust of this activity is to identify and explore new or novel sources and reassess existing sources capable of generating greater that 1 GW peak power and repetition rates in the 10s of hertz; execute an experimental research program that will fully test sources including fabrication and modification of test equipment and diagnostic equipment, and the evaluation and analysis of test results; downselect, design, fabricate and test the most likely candidate technologies based on modeling and experimental results; coordinate source development with pulse power and antenna development after the downselection process has occurred.   Heavy reliance on and coordination between this technical task area and the Theoretical and Computation R&D Technical Task Area 2 is expected.  A further aspect of this technical task area is to investigate, test, and fabricate antenna and antenna array concepts capable of adhering to volumetric requirements stemming from potential air vehicle concepts while obtaining sufficient gain to reach RF intensity goals on target at specified distances based on scenario development.  Consistent with reaching intensity goals is to explore the phenomenon of air breakdown at various altitudes and conditions, and to explore the physics associated with radiating multi-GW RF pulses in space including partially ionized sources in a vacuum and diffraction of antenna patterns by the upper atmosphere.  Work in this area may provide distinct, specialized products and fabrication techniques, unique diagnostics, and innovative methods to overcome air breakdown limits.   

2.   Theoretical and Computational R&D:

The objectives of this technical task area are to advance existing magneto-hydrodynamic codes and plasma modeling codes to verify HPM source concepts and various plasma application experiments.   Numerical analysis of such devices typically employs multidimensional (two and three dimensional) computational physics software of various types.  Examples include magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) software, such as Mach2 and Mach3, for dense plasma phenomena; particle-in-cell (PIC) software, such as ICEPIC, MAGIC and SOS, for collisionless charged particle phenomena; computational electromagnetics (CEM) software, such as PARANA and HFSS, for particle-free electromagnetic phenomena; and other software.  Research conducted by this modeling and simulation technical task area should explore the use of new materials, processes, and methods for improving the HPM source and subsystem performance characteristics, and efficiencies.

The task area also encompasses the theoretical and numerical analysis of systems from the prime mover to the radiating structures to demonstrate scientific and engineering feasibility and assess mission effectiveness.  A significant part of the research conducted in this technical task area is to gain further understanding of microwave effects on various electronic systems.  The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for microwave effects on electronic systems, and evaluate various scenarios to predict microwave effectiveness in engagements.  The development of simulation tools capable of describing the microwave power pattern, electric field, and magnetic field powered by a pulse waveform is highly desired as well as improving codes used in modeling the interaction between a HPM signal and a "target."  These interactions include properly handling ground reflections, multi-path interference, side-lobe suppression techniques, scattering and standing waves, to ultimately determine field quantities at various points in the problem.  The DETAR program is interested in determining scaling laws for frequency, growth rate, and studies of competing instabilities.  

3.  Pulsed Power (PP) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to research and investigate new, innovative, or promising pulse power technologies, devices, and subsystems.  This will involve all aspects of pulse power R&D relevant to HPM and other AFRL/DE applications.  The work under this Technical Task Area includes hardware design, fabrication, assembly and test of components associated with multi- megajoule, greater than ten megamp, terawatt, ten microsecond systems.  Examples of pulse power devices and components include capacitors, inductors, fixed and dynamic (Electrically Exploded Fuse (EEF) and Explosively Formed Fuse (EFF)) resistors, transformers (air-core, ferrite-core, and partial-ferrite-core), over-volt and triggered switches (gas, vacuum, liquid metal, solid-state, and mechanical), insulators (gaseous, liquid, and solid-state), and diodes (vacuum and solid-state).  Examples of pulse power subsystems include capacitor banks, explosive magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs), Marx generators, pulse forming networks (PFNs), pulse forming lines (PFLs), and pulsed power loads. Pulse power loads of interest include vacuum and solid-state HPM sources, implosion devices for intense radiation production, magnetic field compression devices to accelerate charged particles, plasma and hypervelocity projectile accelerators, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to reducing system, subsystem, or component size, weight, efficiency, lifetime and cost, increasing performance, or improving reliability and robustness.  

4.  Pulsed Power Systems (PPS) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore the development of pulse power systems that drive HPM systems, charged particle beam systems, and other pulsed systems at required repetition rates and power levels, and ultimately to reach required volume and mass limits to achieve system requirements that may stem from the various technical task areas.   The scope of this effort includes designing, fabricating, testing, and integrating various pulse power technologies and prime power systems utilizing a systems engineering approach into a compact PPS driver(s) integrated to HPM source(s).  Examples of integrated PPS include single-shot flux compression generator-based inductive storage-pulse conditioning systems for narrow-band HPM tube loads, compact, rep-rated Marx-generator based systems for driving narrow-band or ultra-wide-band HPM sources, and conventional capacitor-bank systems with dynamic vacuum implosion loads.  Some research efforts are expected to be directed at continuous wave converters, oscillators, amplifiers, phased arrays, and wide-band generators.  Further efforts will be devoted towards modifying existing pulse power systems to accommodate new HPM or charged particle beam loads of various impedances.  Particle beam load drivers will be used to reliably achieve full current delivery to drive solid armature or solid liner implosion loads.  Some of these systems include the use of a main pulse driver with two or more auxiliary pulsed power discharges fired with controlled timing relative to the main discharge, with timing jitters as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Additional pulse power system work will include development of explosive magnetic flux compression generators that produce megamps to tens of megamps of current, and megajoules to tens of megajoules of magnetic energy, and the development of high current opening switches in the 10-20 megamp, 5 megajoule range with opening times less than 300 nanoseconds.  Pulse power systems work may include fielding remote experiment operations including the pulsed power system and load, fast photography, and radiation diagnostics.

This technical task area will explore fundamental research into the areas of hardware systems, subsystems, and diagnostic tools/hardware, which in turn will be used to test physical and/or engineering principles.  Diagnostics must be capable of measuring at least the current, voltage, and magnetic field in physical areas associated with experiments that produce hostile blast, debris, radiation fields and thermal environments.  Unique diagnostics include the ability to radiograph the types of experiments included in Technical Task Areas 3 and 4, including solid, armature, and solid liner implosion loads, with multiple radiographs at different, controlled times.  The timing jitters associated with radiography will of necessity be as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Research and experiments will be conducted with the goal of enhancing energy coupling efficiencies, increasing power (trillion watt range) delivered from a PPS driver to an output (experimental) load, mating advanced weapons concept devices to HPM generators, and develop hardware/techniques to characterize system performance.

5.  Prime Power:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore new, efficient, compact, low-mass, prime sources of power for pulse power systems.  This is an enabling technical task area and innovative solutions are sought to drive pulse power systems at desired repetition rates to achieve high average power levels over short pulse trains.  Areas of research for this technical task area include the design, development, modification, testing, and use of compact high-peak power limited lifetime devices, high voltage power supplies, compact transformers, motors, generators, batteries, thermal batteries, fuel cells, power conditioning, rotating machines, inverters, energy storage components, and the like.  A further area of investigation is expected to encompass the modification of existing equipment designed specifically for use in or with existing HPM, PP, PPS, and future compact PP system design.

<DESC>This solicitation has been submitted by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory for the Regional Development Alliance (RDA) and Community Reuse Organization (CRO) located in Idaho Falls, Idaho. The Regional Development Alliance, Inc. (RDA) & Community Reuse Organization (CRO) is seeking expressions of interest regarding conversion and operation of a coal fired power plant located on the property of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) located near Idaho Falls, Idaho.  The objective is to convert this facility, which is currently in shutdown, into a commercial power generation plant.  It is also the objective of the CRO that the operator of the power plant makes the facility available to the researchers at the INEEL for test purposes as long as that research does not interfere with commercial operation. 

The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is making the Coal-fired Steam Generating Facility (CFSGF) located at the INEEL available to the CRO.  The CFSGF is located within the boundaries of the INEEL at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC).  The CFSGF was operated from 1983 through 1999 to provide plant steam to the INTEC complex.  The CRO is investigating acquisition of the CFSGF as excess DOE real property and returning the facility to productive regional use.  Successful respondents would be required to modify the facility for electric power production and potentially co-generation, operate the facility primarily as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) and provide a negotiated revenue stream back to the CRO.
  
Current facility specifications are as follow: two (2) Foster Wheeler Atmospheric Fluidized Bed Boilers, 135,000-pounds steam generation per hour capacity, 650 psig operating pressure, bubbling (limestone) bed design, pulsed jet bag house particulate control, Detroit overbed fuel feeders, stoker coal / processed derived fuel / liquid-solid fuel mixture feeds, fuel feed / bottom ash / fly ash boiler sample ports, and railcar or truck fuel receiving and unloading. The facility could generate approximately 15 - 20 MWe (gross) after addition of turbines and any necessary modifications to the boilers. The boiler house has sufficient space to accommodate two additional boilers that could raise the capacity of the facility.  Preliminary investigations suggest that the transmission grid and the existing environmental permits could accommodate a total capacity of up to 50 MWe.  Additional boiler capacity would need to be negotiated with DOE. The facility is fully equipped with a continuous emission monitoring system. Additionally, the facility has a mobile mounted air analyzer for certification of the stack's emission monitoring system that can be modified to meet project-specific requirements.

The capital facilities currently located at the CFSGF site will be transferred to the successful IPP at no cost but with a negotiated continuing royalty on power generated.  Modifications to the facility will be accomplished by the IPP at its own cost.  The IPP will be responsible for removal of the power plant at the end of its useful life. The successful IPP would enter into a Lease and a Site Interface Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Department of Energy. 

Companies interested in evaluation of this opportunity should submit an expression of interest to the address listed below.  Included with that expression of interest should be a brief financial summary of the submitting entity in sufficient detail to assure the CRO that the submitting entity can fulfill its potential obligations.  The submittals should be made within forty-five (45) days from the issue date of this RFI to the attention of Mr. Tim Solomon at the following address.  Notification of the selection process will be made to successful candidates within thirty (30) days.  Upon notification of selection the candidates will be given the opportunity to make a complete inspection of the property and will be asked to make a formal proposal on the conversion and operation.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command, Soldiers Systems Center (RDECOM-SSC) in Natick, MA, is conducting a market survey for technical information from foreign vendors on a reusable Container Delivery System (CDS) Aft Restraint a nd Release System on C-130 aircraft. The current system uses up to three plies of Type XXVI nylon webbing to provide aft restraint. During airdrop of CDS bundles, the static line retriever winch is activated and through a pulley system it cuts the nylon we bbing with a guillotine knife. A new system is desired that will be reusable while reducing the pull forces on the static line retriever required to actuate the release. Additionally, the new system should be compatible with both Center Vertical Restraint (CVR) and non-CVR operations. The ability to insert interim release gates for the purpose of extending exit times is also critical. This potential science and technology effort in the area of applied research and experimental development being considered is on the order of $50K - $150K per year for one year. Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. All  interested foreign firms, regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this request for information.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, Stennis Space Center, MS, intends to procure the service of Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc. to acquire a Sea Bird SBE 9/11 Plus System. This is replacement of the Oceanographic Data Acquisition System for NOAA Research Vessel Gordon Gunter. The aging scientific equipment on a Fisheries Research vessel requires replacement in order to provide quality data for fisheries stock estimates and management.  The equipment to be replaced provides a vertical profile of the water column containing the following data: 1) Salinity, 2) Temperature 3) Water depth, 4) Dissolved oxygen concentration, 5) Chlorophyll a concentration, 6) Light transmissivity 7) Ambient light availability. These parameters must be sampled at near the same instant in time in order to obtain a realistic representation of the actual oceanographic conditions. This is due to the fact that both the sampling platform, the ship, and the media to be measured, the ocean, are both constantly in motion. The singe instrument, which performs these measurements on Gordon Gunter, is the SBE-25, manufactured by Sea-Bird Electronics. The instrument has been used for several years on the Gordon Gunter and previously on various other research vessels, but is nearing the end of its useful life due to age. Many of the sensors have been replaced over the years because of damage or age. The SBE-25 along with the individual sensors, a personal computer, Sea Bird proprietary software, and an oceanographic winch form an integrated data acquisition on Gordon Gunter. The scientific crew responsible for oceanographic data on Gordon Gunter is also responsible for the data on various other research vessels equipped with a Sea Bird SBE 9/11 Plus System. This system uses the same sensors, software, and maintenance/deployment procedures as the SBE-25. The SBE-25, which is being replaced, uses the same software as the SBE-9/11 Plus System replacement. The same software is in use on the other research vessels as well. The proposed contract actions is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any business capable of providing the exact make and model of the equipment required to perform this work is encourage to respond to this announcement within 15 days after publication of this notice. Interest firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size, and a brief statement regarding its capabilities to perform the work.  Firms should also submit the name, telephone number and point of contact for businesses or other Government agencies to which they have previously provided such work.

The VUAV system will comprise fully integrated components, including: air vehicle, modular and interchangeable payloads, Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) interface systems, ground control systems, launch and recovery equipment, and automatic take-off and landing subsystems. The VUAV system will be expected to successfully operate within the mobility and transportability constraints of the Marine Corps.
With this in mind, Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting a market survey to obtain industry input relative to its current capabilities to satisfy the fully documented Marine Vertical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System requirements. We desire any information on capabilities and performance of the respondent's system/air vehicle as it relates to the capabilities,located in other documents associated with this RFI, and could be demonstrated within the next eighteen months. The VUAV system could have an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) as early as FY10.
Please include in your response information addressing: (1) development status design verification testing and design/configuration stability) of major subsystems and components; (2) production status of major subsystems and components; (3) availability of design and support documentation such as specifications of major subsystems and components; (4) all data links used to include discussion of net-ready and joint interoperability capabilities; (5) sensor payloads, payload capability, weapons load out and payload growth capacity (weight and power); (6) concepts for system load out on a C130, CH - 53 and V-22 (7) estimated production costs for an air vehicle with an electro-optical/infrared/laser designator modular payload and the ability to interchange with future payload such as a communication relay package or a SAR; (8) growth paths for any performance area that does not meet the requirements, and (9) business arrangements such as partners or team members who would participate in the development and manufacture of the system/air vehicle.  
The response should include the following air vehicle (AV) specific data: (10) basis for AV structural design requirements; (11) performance limits (altitude/speed envelope); (12) power required and drag polars, and (13) empty and maximum gross weight table, and (14) data on RF, IR, visual and acoustic signatures on your system.
The response should include the following ground control station data:  (15) basis for control station design requirements; (16) performance limits;  (17) human to computer interfaces; (18) estimated production cost for ground control station capable of simultaneous control of multiple air vehicles, and (19) open architecture capabilities.

<SUBJECT>Integrated Installation Information Architecture
<DESC>This Special Notice has been updated to include the presentation slides and list of registrants/attendees for the Pre-Solicitation Conference that was held on 25 MAR 2004. Future Business Opportunity Announcement Statement of Requirement: Commander, Navy Installations (CNI) has a requirement for services to support the assessment, analysis, and planning associated with the development of an Integrated Installation Information Architecture (I3A) for the Navy-wide shore installation infrastructure. Background: CNI was established in October 2003 with a clear mandate to enhance the effectiveness of shore installation management.  The current CNI business environment is comprised of nine major business areas which are further divided into 32 sub-functional areas, each with its own set of applications and data sources.  CNI is working to significantly reduce the number of its applications and associated data sources and servers.  Other major CNI and Navy initiatives are already underway that are impacting the CNI IT environment.  CNI desires to take immediate action to develop a vision for a viable I3A end state in order to ensure that, as the CNI IT environment continues to evolve, all efforts are effectively aligned. CNI Vision: CNI?s future IT architecture (I3A) will support a robust decision support capability.  It will be expected that the I3A enable the transformation of integrated data into management information, provide data accessibility and situational awareness within and across functional areas, and support improvements in business processes by making available output-driven metrics via a significantly reduced number of standard applications.  The foundation of the I3A will be an effective and efficient integration of the NMCI network with the ?to-be? CNI infrastructure. Major objectives of I3A related initiatives include, but are not limited to: 1) standardization of applications to support establishment of common business practices; 2) alignment with Federal/DOD/Navy IT initiatives, mandates, and guidelines; 3) reduction of IT infrastructure costs and the CNI total cost of managing and operating Navy shore installations; 4) enhancement of management decision support systems; and 5) establishment of authoritative data sources. The I3A initiative will be a carefully planned and phased multi-year effort. Business Opportunity: CNI requires industry expertise in the areas of IT architecture, application rationalization, server consolidation, enterprise application and sensor integration to support the transformation of CNI?s ?as-is? environment into a more effective, efficient, and integrated enterprise IT infrastructure (?to-be?).  This business opportunity is a first step.  Contractor support will be required to: 1) conduct an analysis and assessment of the ?as-is? CNI IT environment in order to create an understanding of the relationship between business processes, applications, and organizations; 2) build on this understanding to develop a framework for the ?to-be? I3A; 3) develop a high-level migration plan using ?gap analysis? or other analytical methods to describe the ?way ahead.?  The migration plan will be supported by prioritized, actionable work packages that provide sufficient information for CNI to make implementation decisions.  Specific attention to identification or development of standards or criteria for sensor integration will be required.  The contractor will also perform analysis related to server consolidation planning and develop an approach that enables CNI to initiate actions that align with evolving Navy plans.  During the performance of work, the successful bidder will be required to integrate and work with other government organizations and support contractors engaged in supporting ongoing Navy and CNI IT initiatives. Contractual Approach: The planned acquisition strategy for this initial effort will be a competition among existing GSA Schedule holders, which will result in an award of an FFP order for a six-month period of performance.  At completion and acceptance of the contract deliverables, CNI will assess the viability of the solutions offered and formulate a plan to execute the CNI I3A initiative. Pre-Solicitation Conference: To further publicize and clarify the scope of the CNI I3A initiative, a ?Pre-Solicitation? Conference will be held on Thursday, 25 March 2004, from 1000 ? 1300 at the Crystal City Hilton Hotel.  Further information concerning the CNI IT Initiative and contractual approach associated with this FBO will be presented.  Additionally, a brief presentation of the current CNI IT projects and other identified government IT initiatives which will impact the CNI I3A initiative will be provided.  A question and answer session will follow. Further detailed information on this conference will be posted on the CNI Clearinghouse website.  All prospective offerors are urged to attend this conference.  In order to make the conference as productive as possible, offerors are requested to submit any questions in writing to the Contracting Officer, Code 0215AC, Contracts Division, SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, SC, fax (843) 218-5930 or via e-mail (angela.e.carter@navy.mil) so as to arrive at least two working days prior to the conference.  Prospective offerors are requested to submit the names of the representatives who will attend the Pre-Solicitation Conference to Angela Carter (via fax or e-mail address noted above) no later than Monday, 22 March 2004.  Since space is limited, each prospective offeror is requested to send no more than 3 representatives to attend the Pre-Solicitation Conference.

Statement of Objectives
Asbestos Database Upgrade 
Altus AFB, Oklahoma

1.	Background
Past building inspections have identified asbestos-containing materials (ACM) in many facilities at Altus AFB (AAFB).  Information developed during past inspections has been input into an in-house database system known as Personal Computer View 3 (PCV3) for managing both asbestos and lead-based paint (LBP).  This database is a DOS based database and is difficult to manage and difficult to input updated information.  Also, the Air Force is moving to incorporate environmental data, including asbestos and lead based paint data, into the ESOMIS database system.  This will occur in the next few years.  The PCV3 database will not allow the current data to transfer into the ESOHMIS database
2.	Objectives
Two major objectives exist for this project: 1) Develop a Microsoft ACCESS database for asbestos and Lead Based Paint and transfer existing data from PCV3 to the new ACCESS database; 2) Provide training to selected Altus AFB personnel on the use and upkeep of the new database..
2.1	Database Conversion
The Base will provide the contractor with a copy of the current PCV3 asbestos and lead based paint database
Contractor will develop an ACCESS database capable of retrieving, updating and manipulating asbestos and LBP information from all facilities surveyed in the 1994-1995 survey.  
Contractor will migrate all information contained in the PCV3 database to the new ACCESS database
Contractor will provide the base with a user’s manual type of instructions for managing the new database.  These instructions shall be in electronic version, allowing the base to reproduce the instructions as necessary.
2.2	     Training
Contractor will provide a one time on site training to selected base personnel.  This training will cover use and management of the asbestos and LBP database
The base will determine which personnel are to receive this training.  All training will be conducted in one session.

3.	Deliverables

Deliverable	Frequency	No of Copies
ACCESS based Asbestos and LBP database	Draft and Final	Base POC	Two (2)
Instruction Manual	Draft and Final	Base POC	One (1)

4.	Meetings

5.	Government Furnished Materials
·	Altus AFB will provide an electronic copy of the database information.
·	Altus AFB will provide information on the known current status of asbestos material not in the existing database.
·	Altus AFB will provide the site and any required multimedia training aids for the contractor to conduct on site training.
·	Altus AFB will assign a project liaison to assist the Contractor in obtaining information and answering questions on the particular needs of the base.

<DESC>Amendment 0004
The closing date of the solicitation is hereby extended to 1700 Baghdad time on 2 April 2004.  In verbal communications with potential offerors, the contracting officer indicated that the Berry Amendment, which applies to this solicitation, only requires that the cloth be manufactured in the U.S.A.  Even though offerors were advised to contact their own attorney with regard to the Berry Amendment, in a sense of fair play the solicitation is extended.  The Berry Amendment requires that the fibers are made or grown in the U.S.A., and the cloth and the end-item are manufactured in the U.S.A.

The legislative history notes that this was the intention of Congress as conveyed below:

"The Committee notes that it has long been the intent of Congress that this provision covers not only fabrics and apparel themselves but also all stages of textile production and all types of textile products, including manufactured articles. The Committee further notes that synthetic fabric fuel containers for military aircraft are included within the coverage of this provision and directs the Secretary to instruct the relevant offices within the Department of Defense to take note of this and ensure that Department procurements are consistent with the requirements of this provision." S.Rep. No. 154, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 368 (1992).


According, please submit revised prices, certification from the textile manufacturer that the cloth is produce from U.S.A. fibers and the place of manufacture of the end item.

All offerors are reminded that they must comply with all solicitation requirements and amendments.
