Phase 2 will be final exhibit design and engineering, and Phase 3 will consist of  fabrication and installation. It is strongly recommended that all prospective offerors make a site visit to examine the location of the work.

The firm date will be included in the RFQ. Effective October 1, 2003, prospective vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract.

It is anticipated that a Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be issued on or about December 19, 2003, however all dates in this announcement are subject to change.  The RFP will be issued via www.fedbizopps.gov/ but the Government reserves the right to issue the solicitation on paper or CD-ROM if the website becomes inoperable or if the Contracting Officer determines it is in the Government's best interest to do so.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about December 16, 2003 to solicit industry proposals for the management and payment of insurer claims for reimbursement as part of its implementation of Title I of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the Act). Section 104 (a) of the Act provides that, “[T]he Secretary may employ persons or contract for services as may be necessary to implement the Program.”  

The Act establishes a temporary Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (Program) under which the Federal Government will share the risk of insured loss from certified acts of terrorism with commercial property and casualty insurers until the Program sunsets on December 31, 2005.  However, Section 108(b) of the Act provides the authority to pay or adjust compensation for insured losses after termination of the Act.

Treasury rulemaking has been modeled on customary business practices and procedures of the reinsurance industry.   As stated in the rulemaking to implement the Act, Treasury seeks to establish operational procedures that emulate, as appropriate, the best practices of a re-insurer.  This contract is to support these activities.

Interested parties may request the RFP from the Contracting Officer, John A. Palmieri, through email requests at john.palmieri@do.treas.gov. A pre-proposal conference will be conducted on or about January 8, 2004. The time and place for the conference will be announced in the RFP. Questions and/or clarification requests related to the RFP must be submitted to the Contracting Officer by email at john.palmieri@do.treas.gov by December 30, 2003, and will be addressed at the pre-proposal conference. Treasury will use the questions and clarification requests to determine if changes to the RFP will be necessary. Proposals will be required on or about February 6, 2004.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health, announces the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP) to support research to facilitate the efficient execution of NINDS-sponsored clinical research in order to complete more clinical research projects and to develop and test more treatments of neurological diseases more expeditiously.  NINDS-supported investigators will use the Clinical Research Collaboration (CRC) Facility to assist with recruitment of patients for clinical studies, involving the broadest possible range of patients and physicians.  Hundreds of academic-based and practice-based neurologists will recruit and follow patients through access to multiple clinical research protocols coordinated by the CRC Facility.  Researchers will have more ready access to larger groups of patients with rare diseases.  Research projects will be developed, funded, analyzed, and reported by independent investigators through the traditional peer-review process, with the CRC Facility serving as hub and providing research support services.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract will be made for a period of five years in September 2004.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  It will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address:(http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THE WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to numbered note 26. ****

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   NAICS Code: 541990 THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIO0NAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-04-00076 and the solicitation is being issued as a request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition  Circular 01-16.  The associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.0 million.  Full and open competition procedures will be utilized.  A firm fixed price purchase order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures is anticipated to result from the  award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the development of four-dimensional data assimilation in weather research and forecast model for air quality applications.  STATEMENT OF WORK: Background: The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model is EPA's principal numerical air quality  modeling tool for scientific and policy analyses for tropospheric ozone, fine particulate matter, acid deposition, and visibility.  This model derives its meteorological input from the NCAR/Penn State Mesoscale Model Version 5 (MM5), itself a community model for weather forecasting and analysis.   To achieve a tight coupling between the air quality and meteorological models, the CMAQ model uses the same parameters of the grid definition and map projection as the MM5 model.  Thus there is a strong dependence of the CMAQ model on MM5 for meteorological input.  Since most applications of the  CMAQ model by EPA and the states involve application of the modeling system for a historical episode, there was no need to use the MM5 in a "weather forecast mode", but rather in a retrospective mode.  Therefore EPA supported the development of a four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) technique  for MM5 (actually an earlier version in the MM series of models), known as Newtonian nudging, in which observed surface and aloft meteorological observations are used to continuously "nudge" the solutions of the MM5 model equations throughout the entire model simulation (Stauffer and Seaman, 1990,  1994).  This provides more accurate meteorological fields for the air quality model to use.  In recent years, as the MM series of models has progressed to Version 5, a decision was made by NCAR that makes the successor model to MM5 a new model called the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) Model.   Therefore there will be no MM6 to couple with the EPA CMAQ model, but rather there will be a WRF model to couple with CMAQ.  This new model is also to be a community model, maintained by NCAR.  Beta-test versions of the model are now available and are being used throughout the mesoscale modeling  community.  At the current time, plans for the inclusion of Newtonian nudging in the WRF model are vague.  Other data assimilation techniques that are less useful for air quality purposes, and more applicable to weather forecasting applications, are being included in the WRF model system.  As with  the predecessor MM model series, EPA has an interest in including Newtonian nudging FDDA in the successor model, WRF, for linking this model to the CMAQ model for air quality applications.  Without this FDDA technique in WRF, EPA would be in a compromised position for application of its principal  air quality modeling system.  Purpose: The purpose of this procurement is to acquire the senior meteorologist servicesto modify and test the WRF model available from NCAR with the existing FDDA Newtonian nudging techniques available in the MM5 model.  The resulting modified WRF model, and any  required preprocessors, would then be made available to NCAR as an addition to its community model.  The resulting modified WRF model would also be available to EPA, the states, and others to couple with the CMAQ model for air quality applications.  In the initial stages of this work, the  contractor will acquire the most current versions of the WRF and MM5 modeling systems from NCAR (available at http://wrf-model.org/ and http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/mm5-home.html, respectively).  An initial analysis of the WRF model code is to be performed as to the application of "analysis" and  "observations" nudging in WRF.  Analysis nudging refers to the assimilation of larger scale analyzed meteorological fields into WRF model simulations, while observations nudging refers to the assimilation of single point or profile measurements into (usually fine-scale) model simulations.  Both  types of nudging are available now in the MM5.  The contractor will study how these techniques have been implemented in the MM5 model in advance of implementation in the WRF model.  The resulting code in WRF is to be tested on a historical application period, to be specified by the EPA Project  Officer, and documentation of the changes to the WRF system to enable analysis and observations Newtonian nudging FDDA is to be prepared.  The application/demonstration of the revised WRF code should include at least three domains of different scale (e.g., continental U.S., northeast U.S., NYC or  Boston area) and different horizontal grid cell sizes (e.g., 32km, 8km, and 2km).  Task:  The Contractor shall:  1) Acquire and review the model code for analysis and observations Newtonian nudging FDDA in the most current available version of the MM5 meteorological model; 2) Acquire and review the  code and coding conventions in the most current available version of the WRF meteorological model; especially those sections that will need to be modified for adding analysis and observations Newtonian nudging FDDA; 3) Prepare a written plan for the addition of analysis and observations Newtonian  nudging FDDA in the WRF model; 4) Implement the code modifications needed in the WRF model and its preprocessors for the addition of Newtonian nudging; 5) Consult with the EPA Project Officer as to the selection of a historical episode for testing, and run the WRF model system including Newtonian  nudging FDDA for this period.   The application should include at least three one-way nested model domains, and the use of analysis and observations nudging as appropriate for the grid resolutions.  Run control simulations without FDDA on the same episode, for comparison purposes; and 6) Prepare a  report documenting the overall approach and coding modifications made to the WRF model system for adding analysis and observations Newtonian nudging FDDA, as well as the results of testing and evaluation on the historical episode for simulation.  Deliverables: 1) Workplan and algorithm outline for  the addition of analysis and observations Newtonian nudging FDDA in the WRF meteorological model(Due 3 months after contract award); 2) Progress report on Task 4: Implementation of code modifications in WRF model and processors for analysis and observations Newtonian nudging FDDA (Due 6 months  after contract award); 3) Revised WRF model system computer code and in-line documentation implementing analysis and observations Newtonian nudging FDDA (Task 4)	(Due 10 months after contract award); and 4) Final report describing the development and testing of the analysis and observations  Newtonian nudging FDDA scheme in the WRF model (Tasks 5,6) (Due 14 months after contract award). Government Responsibilities: The Project Officer shall make available to the Contractor, the web sites for access to the latest versions of the MM5 and WRF meteorological models.  The Project Officer  shall provide written comments to the Contractor on the final scientific report within 10 days of receipt.  Period of Performance: 14 (fourteen) months from effective date of contract award.  Selection Criteria:  EPA will select a vendor based upon cost and technical factors so that the Agency  receives the best value for this purchase, with technical factors being significantly more important than cost.  The requirements for the selected contractor are that the offeror:  (1) have experience in the modeling of mesoscale meteorology and four-dimensional data assimilation; (2) have  documented prior experience in using the MM5 and WRF mesoscale meteorological models; (3) have documented prior experience in developing analysis and observations Newtonian nudging FDDA in mesoscale meteorological models; and 4) Past Performance: Please provide contact information for at least  three recent customers (within the past three years) for similar work.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a sole source HUBZone contract to American Technology Corp, Baltimore, MD for the manufacture of 200,000 Second Skins for the MCU-2A/P mask.  The MCU-2A/P is the primary Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Protective Mask used by the Air Force and Navy for their ground forces.  The MCU-2A/P is a single eye lens variant of the M-40 Mask currently used by the Army and Marines.  The MCU series mask consists of silicon face blank and nose cup, side mounted C2/C2A1 canister, six point head harness, front and side voicemitters, drinking tube and built in microphone pass-through.  The face blank is vulnerable to chemical agent permeation since silicon will allow chemical agents, especially liquid to penetrate at a much faster rate, thus jeopardizing the protective capability of the mask.  The Second Skin is a molded covering that fits over the face blank of the mask providing the needed chemical protection.  Point of contact is Lt Cheryl Collins at (210) 536-8223, cheryl.collins@brooks.af.mil

Statement of Work
Large Analog/Digital Audio Visual Switchers/Routers
Elkwood Project



C.1. BACKGROUND

The Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center (NAVCC) is currently under construction in Culpepper, VA and will be the first centralized facility in America especially planned and designed for the cataloging, storage and preservation of the nation’s heritage collections of moving image and recorded sound materials.  It is expected to be the largest facility of its kind, a state-of-the-art conservation and preservation facility dedicated to the preservation of our audio-visual heritage, which will ensure that the heritage is accessible to generations to come.  The Library is interested in exploring the technologies and systems that could be used for central and local switching/routing of analog and digital AV signals in the NAVCC.

C.2. SCOPE

The Library of Congress specifically seeks the following information: 1) Conceptual technical alternatives and assessments. 2) Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives. In addition The Library of Congress requires the ten elements describe in more detail in section C.3.1.  The contractor shall provide required information in written format.

C.3. GENERAL REQUIRMENTS

C.3.1. Additional issues that the Library wishes respondents to address are 3) fail over issues.  What happens when a segment fails or has its quality compromised?  Discovery, diagnosis, substitution and notification, etc.  4) Cabling requirements and wiring for multiple formats/forms of audio and video.  Outlets and wall plates.  5) SMPTE time code handling, test signals, and automation/machine code handling.  6) Monitoring and managements of system, ease of use, inclusion in other databases as metadata. 7) Local (within room) vs. building-wide wiring/switching/routing, control, and user interface(s).  8) Installation of routers/switchers and pathway verification.  9) Maintenance issues. 10) What issues would arise if implementation of one of more media formats were deferred?  11) Any other issues relating to analog/digital AV routing that the Library should explore in order to assure that the NAVCC can effectively fulfill its goals.

C.4. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

C.4.1. Currently the Library’s motion picture and sound recording holdings include more than 3,500,000 items.  The collections to be housed at the NAVCC have grown at an average rate of 120,000 items annually.  In addition, off-air online capture of broadcast 
and born digital media represent other significant collections growth areas.  The Library estimates that 10,000-20,000 hour of such content will be acquired annually.

C.4.2. Obsolete formats/media continue to be received and added to the Library’s collections: the need to read old and obsolete formats/media will persist long into the future.  Past and present preservation practice for older media has been to make an analog copy of the item on current media.  Digital archiving, however, is seen as the future of preservation.  A switch to an emphasis on digital archiving is planned for the NAVCC, with digital streams being output from preservation copying rather than solely analog.  The Library has every video media type from the 1950s to the present.  Independent analog and digital audio channels will be required.  Refer to Attachment A for matrix of all commercial and consumer based video products.

	C.4.3. Current estimates for the number of channels required:
-	640 Analog Audio
-	640 Digital Audio
-	128 Analog Video (w/associated audio)
-	256 digital Video (w/associated audio)
-	RS-422/232 Control over IP and/or standard routing

C.5. DELIVERABLES: Not yet established.

C.6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Not yet established.

C.7. APPLICABLE DOCUMENTATION:  See attachments A and B.

C.8. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT/PROPERTY

C.8.1. In the NAVCC, the following rooms have been designated and designed to facilitate productivity and quality:
-	Nine to ten Audio Expert/Standard/Production Transfer Nodes (A1);
-	Two Audio Production/Standard Transfer Nodes (A2);
-	Three Video Duplication Nodes (non-robotic) (V1);

Statement of Work
Large Analog/Digital Audio Visual Switcher/Router



C.1. BACKGROUND

The Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center (NAVCC) is currently under construction in Culpeper, VA and will be the first centralized facility in America especially planned and designed for the cataloging, storage and preservation of the nation’s heritage collections of moving image and recorded sound materials.  It is expected to be the largest facility of its kind, a state-of-the-art conservation and preservation facility dedicated to the preservation of our audio-visual heritage, which will ensure that that heritage is accessible to generations to come.  The Library is interested in exploring the technologies and systems that could be used for central and local switching/routing of analog and digital AV signals in the NAVCC.

C.2. SCOPE

The Library of Congress specifically seeks the following information: 1) Conceptual technical alternatives and assessments. 2) Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives.  The Library also wishes respondents to address the elements described in Section C.3.1.  The contractor shall provide required information in written format.

C.3. GENERAL REQUIRMENTS

C.3.1. Additional issues that the Library wishes respondents to address are 3) failover issues.  What happens when a segment fails or has its quality compromised?  Discovery, diagnosis, substitution and notification, etc.  4) Cabling requirements and wiring for multiple formats/forms of audio and video.  Outlets and wall plates.  5) SMPTE time code handling, test signals, and automation/machine code handling.  6) Monitoring and managements of system, ease of use, inclusion in other databases as metadata. 7) Local (within room) vs. building-wide wiring/switching/routing, control, and user interface(s).  8) Installation of routers/switchers and pathway verification.  9) Maintenance issues. 10) What issues would arise if implementation of one of more media formats were deferred?  11) Any other issues relating to analog/digital AV routing that the Library should explore in order to assure that the NAVCC can effectively fulfill its goals.

C.4. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

C.4.1. Currently the Library’s motion picture and sound recording holdings include more than 3,500,000 items.  The collections to be housed at the NAVCC have grown at an average rate of 120,000 items annually.  In addition, off-air and online capture of broadcast 
and born digital media represent other significant collections growth areas.  The Library estimates that 10,000-20,000 hours of such content will be acquired annually.

C.4.2. Obsolete formats/media continue to be received and added to the Library’s collections: the need to read old and obsolete formats/media will persist long into the future.  Past and present preservation practice for older media has been to make an analog copy of the item on current media.  Digital archiving, however, is seen as the future of preservation.  A switch to an emphasis on digital archiving is planned for the NAVCC, with digital streams being output from preservation copying rather than solely analog.  The Library has every video media type from the 1950s to the present.  Independent analog and digital audio channels will be required.  Refer to Attachment A for matrix of all commercial and consumer based video products.

	C.4.3. Current estimates for the number of channels required:
-	640 Analog Audio
-	640 Digital Audio
-	128 Analog Video (w/associated audio)
-	256 digital Video (w/associated audio)
-	RS-422/232 Control over IP and/or standard routing

C.4.4. During the life of the building some of the facilities may be repurposed to efficiently address work being done at the time.  The wiring/routing/switching systems throughout the facility, as well as within the individual work rooms, need  to be flexible enough to serve the NAVCC reliably for the foreseeable future.

C.5. DELIVERABLES: Not yet established.

C.6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Not yet established.

C.7. APPLICABLE DOCUMENTATION:  See attachments A and B.

C.8. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT/PROPERTY

C.8.1. In the NAVCC, the following rooms have been designated and designed to facilitate productivity and quality:
-	Nine to ten Audio Expert/Standard/Production Transfer Nodes (A1);
-	Two Audio Production/Standard Transfer Nodes (A2);
-	Three Video Duplication Nodes (non-robotic) (V1);
-	Up to four Robot-assisted Production Nodes (central Machine Room):
-	One Video quality monitoring and review room (QA);
-	Five (estimated) Born Digital processing Nodes (possible);
-	One Video Off-satellite Recording Node “Satcast” (possible);
-	Four Digital Restoration of Film Nodes and Two Datacine Nodes;
-	One theater with several film projectors, two sound systems including FOH speakers for speech amplification and a programmable cinema system with surround;
-	Various listening/viewing stations throughout the facility.

(Refer to Attachment B for room locations and other information.) Ideally, a signal stream coming from a source device should be deliverable to its destination – within the same room or to a different room within the complex – without loss of quality.  The source device might be in the same room where work is being done on what is being played, or it may reside elsewhere in the facility.  It is also desirable to be able to route the analog/digital signal being worked on to multiple locations simultaneously to facilitate professional consultation or supervisory QA.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State, Office of Acquisition Management will issue a solicitation for the manufacture of armored vehicles.  These armored vehicles will be worldwide for protection of American officials.  A portion of the solicitation is classified as Secret.  All offerors will have a pre-solicitation site visit and will be evaluated by the attached site survey by a government official.  The manufacturing will be accomplished at the contractors’ facilities and shipped to the Department of State Facilities located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.   It is anticipated the contract will have a 12 month base year with 4 one-year options.  The government contemplates an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for this requirement.  Future acquisitions will be full and open competition with firms who have clearance or who are able to obtain clearances prior to the release of the solicitation.  The Government will issue a synopsis well in advance of the solicitation release so firms that may not possess the required clearances are given the opportunity to obtain a clearance.  However, due to the time and cost associated with the clearance process, the Department will only sponsor those firms for clearance that it believes have the necessary technical capabilities to furnish these vehicles.  The clearance process as well as the necessary technical capabilities will be included in the synopsis so that all firms are aware of the Government’s requirements.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is DG133W-04-RQ-0014 and this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation has incorporated provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-17.  This acquisition is being conducted as a full and open competitive requirement.  The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service (NWS) presently has custom-written software running on Intel x86-based computers using the Red Hat Linux 7.2 operating system.  The Red Hat Linux 7.2 operating system is scheduled for end-of-life (termination of support by Red Hat) on 31 December 2003.  NWS has a requirement to continue to use the Red Hat 7.2 through September 2005.  Therefore, NWS is looking for contractors who have the capability to support the Red Hat 7.2 until it is replaced in September 2005.  The required support consists of providing tested binary patches for the component packages in Red Hat Linux 7.2.  The contractor shall promptly provide patches for any reported security vulnerabilities that affect any components of Red Hat Linux 7.2, and also provide any patches that the above-mentioned security-related patches depend on.  The contractor will also provide patches (drivers) as requested to support new hardware, and patches as requested to support upgrades to component packages of Red Hat 7.2.  NWS’s own servers and procedures will be utilized to deploy patches.  Vulnerabilities, errata, and upgrades for which the contractor is required to provide patches will already have been patched for some other version of the Linux operating system, or the patches will be available in source code form from the maintainers of the utilities in question.  The contractor will not be expected to provide drivers for any hardware which has never before been supported under Linux.  Patches must be tested by executing the patched utility on x86 hardware.  The Government may require that certain patches be tested on specific Government Furnished equipment.  The patches shall be provided in easily-installable packages.  RPMs are preferable.   Compressed tar files with installation scripts are acceptable.  The contractor shall provide consultation and support services as necessary to NWS Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) in planning and executing deployment of the patch.  The contractor may be asked to provide services or assistance for diagnosing OS, infrastructure (for example XFree86), and hardware problems.  The contractor shall submit a statement of work and a quality assurance plan that address the above requirements and the following scenarios:   
(1) Patches for critical security vulnerabilities must be made available as soon as possible after the NWS requests them.  The contractor will have only five business days after notification to provide a test patch.  (2) Patches to support hardware and software upgrades:  NWS will notify the contractor at least 30 calendar days before the required delivery date.  (3) The contractor may be asked to provide assistance with low-level systems programming or diagnostic services.  This acquisition is for one base year with one one-year option.  The anticipated start date for this acquisition is 01 January 2004.  The following provisions apply to this RFQ: 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial, Tehnical/Management/Past Performance portion of the proposal shall be submitted separately from the Price portion; 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items, Technical/Management/Past Performance is more important than price.  The Contractor’s Solution to the above requirement will be evaluated, the Contractor’s Quality Assurance Plan will be evaluated, and the Contractor’s Past Performance will be evaluated.  For Past Performance, Contractor’s must submitted relevant experience along with points of contact information.  The past performance data can not be no more than 3 years old.  Cost is not scored but will be evaluated for realism.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Lubos Navratil, Secretary, Crisis Management Staff of Central Bohemia, Zborovska 11, 150 21 Prague 5, Czech Republic, Phone: + 420-257-280-156.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to deliver technical assistance to develop an integrated emergency management system (IEMS) in the Central Bohemia Region of the Czech Republic.

The Government of the Central Bohemia Region of the Czech Republic is developing an IEMS.  The project would attempt to create a plan for cooperation between all governmental first-responders to work together.  There would be mutual sharing of databases as well as the development of networks that would allow for real-time sharing of information during a crisis.  A Regional Emergency Center (REC) would be established to coordinate the various efforts.  This center will be both a clearinghouse of information, through a dedicated Internet portal and database exchange, and a communication channel.  

The project will also involve the establishment of IEMS infrastructure for municipal emergency centers – 26 in Central Bohemia.  These will be created on a shared basis with the local fire rescue emergency centers (33).  The municipal emergency centers will act as points of communication and coordination.  They will coordinate closely with the REC.  This is a high priority task, since the newly created 26 municipalities with “extended authorities” will take over the responsibilities of the existing administrative districts. 

The objective of the technical assistance is to perform technical, environmental, economic and financial assessments of the project and to complete a conceptual design of an IEMS.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $395,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  RCS Kladno, s.r.o., a private Czech firm with substantial expertise in emergency management systems, has been pre-selected as a sub-contractor on this project.  The subcontract will be worth $51,550, however the details of the budget and the exact terms of reference for the subcontract will be based on negotiations between the U.S. firm and RCS Kladno, s.r.o.  A notional budget and terms of reference for the subcontract has been included in the bid documentation.  USTDA will hire an independent consultant to review invoices and deliverables from RCS Kladno, s.r.o.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, December 15, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

 SOLICITATION NUMBER: RFP 263-04-011
 ISSUANCE DATE: December 4, 2003
 CLOSING DATE/TIME: 4:30 pm Cairo time on January 11, 2004  
 POSITION TITLE: Chief Information Officer (CIO)
 MARKET VALUE:  GS-13
 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 2 years with three-one year option years. 
 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/ Cairo, Egypt 
 SECURITY ACCESS: SECRET 
 AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens
  
 POSITION DESCRIPTION
 
I.	Introduction: 
             
               Organizational Location of Position: The position requires residence in Cairo, Egypt. Cairo (pop. approx. 16 million) is the largest city in Africa and Middle East. Although suffering from many urban problems (e.g. severe pollution, and traffic congestion), Cairo is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites and most sports. The Red Sea and the Mediterranean, easily reachable for weekend trips, provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba.
          
              USAID/ Egypt Program : USAID/ Egypt manages the largest and one of the most diverse bilateral assistance program in USAID, with Fiscal Year [FY] 2004 operating year budget of $575 million and a pipeline of approximately $1.4 billion. The Mission, with 47 U.S. Direct Hire (USDH), 21 U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC), and approximately 240 Foreign Service National (FSN) employees, manages approximately 130 major contracts and grants. The program is highly visible and, consequently, attracts intense State Department interest, Embassy oversight and Congressional scrutiny. USAID/ Egypt is implementing assistance programs across its Strategic Objectives (SOs). 
 	 
	The Mission employs a vast range of mechanisms in implementing activities to achieve these SOs, including cash transfer policy reform programs, infrastructure construction, endowments, a commodity import program and a significant local currency program, in addition to traditional technical assistance and grants.

              The USAID/ Egypt Mission also supports the US-Egyptian Partnership for Economic Growth and Development. The Partnership provides an additional dimension of complexity to program management because of the imperative to balance long-term foreign assistance objectives with more immediate priorities articulated by the Office of the Vice President and a wide range of other US government departments/ agencies participating in the Partnership. The Mission is currently restructuring its portfolio to accommodate the planned reduction in the program budget over the next couple of years and a newly- approved Country Strategy that is designed to support Egypt’s efforts to compete successfully in the global economy.

II.		Basic Functions


The Chief Information Officer (CIO) serves as chief of the information division within the Office of Management, USAID Egypt, providing oversight and general supervision of the Data Management Services (DMS) and Communications and Records (C&R) offices.  As the Mission’s Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO), the CIO is responsible for the development, implementation and enforcement of information system security plans and procedures in accordance with USG and USAID regulations and policies.  The CIO serves as the principle advisor to Mission management on all aspects of information systems operations, communications, and records management.

III.	Specific Duties and Responsibilities

1.  Information Systems Security

The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that all USAID/Egypt information systems operate effectively, efficiently and securely.

The Contractor monitors security measures to protect system integrity, oversees the implementation and state of readiness of the Disaster Recovery Site, and serves as the primary point of contact with the AID/Washington Office of Information Resources Management on all matters relating to systems security.   The Contractor is accountable to the Information Systems Security Manager in USAID/Washington for security plan development, system compliance auditing, conduct of self-assessments, and implementation of a computer security education and awareness program.  The Contractor will oversee the conduct of annual mandatory information systems security training for all Mission employees, and will develop activities to ensure continued employee sensitivity to systems security requirements.  The Contractor performs security checks as needed, and advises Mission management on potential vulnerabilities and how to resolve them.  

2.  Information Systems Operations

The Contractor provides oversight and general supervision to the Data Management Services office, which installs, maintains and periodically upgrades all computer hardware and software operating systems.  The Contractor ensures that all systems are operated and maintained in accordance with USAID policies, standards and regulations.

The Contractor oversees the evaluation, development and implementation of application systems by DMS staff, identifying future Mission needs and working with DMS staff to develop responses to those needs.  The Contractor works with Mission management and technical and support offices to ensure that services provided by DMS are responsive to Mission needs, that operation and backup schedules minimize disruption to the work schedule, and that appropriate support is provided to TDYers working for extended periods of  time at the USAID/Egypt Mission.  The Contractor oversees the long-term planning for procurement and upgrading of all Mission automated data processing (ADP) systems.  The Contractor identifies opportunities for USAID Egypt to serve as a pilot site for implementation and testing of new Agency-wide systems and applications.  The Contractor advises USAID-funded programs and projects on technical aspects of program-funded information technology acquisitions, including activity design, feasibility studies, and training, taking into account equipment compatibility and functionality at remote sites where the reliability of the electric supply and quality of phone lines can damage sophisticated equipment.

3.  Communications

The Contractor oversees Mission use of communications systems, including telephone (both landline and mobile), radio, facsimile, and email systems, to ensure appropriate and secure use of all such systems.  The Contractor coordinates with Mission management on development and implementation of policies relating to use of such equipment, and serves as the primary liaison with the Embassy’s Information Management unit to ensure the provision of optimal telephone services.  The Contractor ensures that all systems are operated in accordance with USAID policies, standards and regulations, and that systems are operated effectively and efficiently.   The Contractor oversees the long-term planning for procurement and upgrading of all Mission communications systems.

4.  Records Management

The Contractor oversees the distribution, storage and disposal of official and unofficial Mission communications (cables, facsimiles, courier- and mail-delivered documents, etc.).  The Contractor monitors Mission compliance with USAID policies, procedures and regulations relating to maintenance of official USAID files, ensuring that all Mission staff are cognizant of their responsibilities for safeguarding sensitive information.  The Contractor serves as principle advisor to Mission managers on all matters pertaining to records management.  The Contractor oversees the procurement planning process for acquisition and replacement of photocopying machines, and the implementation of computer imaging and archiving technologies which will reduce Mission dependence on paper-based documentation.

5.  Overall IO Supervision 

The Contractor supervises the Data Management Services and Communications & Records Management offices, guiding the establishment of office work objectives, overseeing the development of individual employee work plans, and monitoring achievement of established goals and objectives.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses to provide the NIH with rental of cold water coolers (no-spill system), delivery of bottled drinking water and cups.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS.  This is a request for interested firms with the capability of providing the required services to submit a capability statement for the purpose of determining whether or not this procurement will be set aside for small/small disadvantaged businesses.  For small business set-asides, any concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must furnish the product of a small business manufacturer.  The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 312112 with a size standard of 500 employees.   Many of the buildings located at the NIH main campus, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD, and the NIH Animal Care Center, Poolesville, MD, contain drinking water with an unacceptable level of lead content.  The NIH Office of Research Services is responsible for supplying drinking water to those facilities where the water has been determined to contain unacceptably high lead content.  Under any resultant contract, the contractor shall be responsible for furnishing rental coolers (without hot water dispenser feature), “no-spill” system, equipped with cup dispenser.  Currently the NIH has approximately 2,640 coolers located in various locations.  The contractor shall deliver bottled water/cups to each water cooler twice weekly (Tuesday and Friday), excluding Federal holidays.  If the scheduled delivery falls on a Federal holiday, the contractor shall delivery the bottled water on the following workday.  Contractor-furnished bottle racks shall be provided at each location next to the coolers for both back-up water bottles and empty water bottles.  The contractor shall be responsible for replacing any water cooler which is determined to be dirty, has an odor, or the water develops an unusual taste.  At the request of the Government, new facilities may be added throughout the life of any resultant contract which shall be serviced by the contractor.  Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (1) a capability statement demonstrating their experience and capability to fulfill the Government’s requirement.  Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the area under consideration.  Experience should identify on-going and/or previous contracts performed including a brief description, dollar value, client’s name, address, telephone number, and name of contact and duration of contract.  (2) available resources; (3) firm’s size and type of business (e.g., small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), etc.); and, (4) evidence of membership in the International Bottled Water Association partnerships and alliances or the National Sanitation Foundation.  Interested firms responding to this notice that propose to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must identify the name of the manufacturer they intend to utilize under any resultant contract.  Two copies of the capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis no later than 15 calendar days from date posted on FedBizOpps.  When utilizing a courier service, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail, the city, state and zip code MUST READ ROCKVILLE, MD 20852.  Responses by facsimile (FAX) WILL NOT be accepted.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether sufficient small businesses possess the capability to fulfill the Government’s requirement and to ensure competition under a set-aside acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

3.0	INTRODUCTION, OVERVIEW, OR BACKGROUND

Technical Training Management System (TTMS)
Headquarters Air Education & Training Command
Directorate of Plans & Programs, Requirements, Information Technology (XPRI)
Providing Software Tools For Managing Air Force Technical Training Students


The TTMS utilizes commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software to systematically modernize specific training functions and locations.

It provides a suite of automated tools to manage schoolhouse activities, reporting tools to aid decision makers, and new business practices to maximize efficiency and minimize duplication.

This system supports the following functions:
	
Student Management

Provides training organizations with software tools for training management, student management, scheduling, tracking, and historical reports targeted for all technical training courses within the command.
Also employs related resource scheduling, tracking, and utilization information.

Standardizes student/course management data collection, reporting, and systematically modernized specific training functions.  This phase also provided operational benefits for future implementation phases.

Currently used by over 5,000 faculty members.
Supports approximately 1,800 courses.
Manages over 30,000 new students each year.
Manages Advanced Skill Level Training.
Tracks over 100,000 students annually.


Integrates an automated Instructional System Design (ISD) process with a central database at six training locations.

The course data automatically populates the Student Management data necessary for the student management process.

Customer requests required the development of several course control document templates necessary for course developers.

Reduced course development from 8 – 10 months to 10 – 12 weeks!

Query Capability

Established the need to provide query capability to Training Leadership at all levels.  

Provides the Training Leadership with the necessary access to TTMS production data through a series of pre-defined cubes. 

Evaluation

This phase will modernize and automate the course evaluation process.  The initial deployment is defined as fielding non-TTMS integrated software at the six training locations for Graduate Assessment Surveys (GAS), End-of-Course Critiques and Course Evaluation/Validation.  The final phase will integrate the field evaluation questionnaires and Testing.

Resource Management

This phase will allow users to manage all facets of resource management to include shared utilization of major equipment items, determine equipment utilization rates, and facility utilization.

Employee Management


This phase will provide management insight to instructor qualifications, define instructor-training requirements, and document instructor-training accomplishments.  This will also serve as the instructor’s formal record set.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is one of several bureaus of the U.S. Department of Commerce, a cabinet level agency of the executive branch of the United States of America.

In the 21st century every aspect of the NOAA mission faces new urgency given the intensifying national needs of the environment, the economy, and public safety. The NOAA role in facing these challenges is to assess and predict environmental changes, protect life and property, provide decision makers with reliable scientific information, manage the Nation's living marine and coastal resources, and foster global environmental stewardship. 

VISION - 	To move NOAA into the 21st century scientifically and operationally, in the same interrelated manner as the environment that we observe and forecast, while recognizing the link between our global economy and our planet's environment.

MISSION - 	To understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation's economic, social, and environmental needs.

MISSION GOALS - 

1)	Protect, restore and manage the use of coastal and ocean resources through ecosystem-based management.

2)	Understand climate variability and change to enhance society's ability to plan and respond.

3)	Serve society's needs for weather and water information.

4)	Support the Nation's commerce with information for safe, efficient, and environmentally sound transportation.


National Ocean Service (NOS)

The NOS mission is to manage society's uses of coastal ecosystems t sustain their natural resources and services.  With nearly 1200 employees and a budget of $500 million, the NOS ranks fourth in size among the five NOAA line offices.   Described as a "national leader for coastal stewardship" and "the primary Federal agency working to preserve the nation's coastal resources through observation, measurement, assessment, and management," NOS helps to meet the challenges facing U.S. coastal regions.

NOS has the widest range of coastal program responsibilities and missions of any Federal agency.  By taking an integrated approach to coastal issues, NOS addresses the complexities of the coast.  As the Federal partner to the 34 coastal states and territories under the Coastal Zone Management Act, NOS is responsible for the 95,000 miles of U.S. coastline.  NOS administers the world's largest system of marine protected areas.  NOS is the Nation's natural resource trustee in the event of major offshore oil spills, and supports a wide range of research, including the forecasting of natural hazards such as the onset of harmful algal blooms or red tides, to better understand and advance the sustainable use of coastal resources.  NOS is active in mapping U.S. coral reefs, monitoring coral reef health, and supporting state and territorial efforts to protect local reefs.  NOS provides critical navigation services to the maritime community - nautical charts and products, hydrographic and shoreline data, accurate positioning data, and real-time/forecast water levels, tides and currents conditions.  


Office of Coast Survey (OCS) 

The Office of Coast Survey (OCS) manages the NOAA nautical charting and nautical data collection and information programs. The Office manages an integrated suite of programs in hydrography and cartography.  It operates interactively to help protect both life and property, support economic growth and development, and protect the environment in support of the overall mission to promote safe navigation.  The Office collects and evaluates marine hydrographic and other navigational data; determines requirements for and conducts a national program of nautical charting; constructs and maintains nautical charts, Coast Pilots, and related marine products for the nation.  It directs field programs for ship and shore based hydrographic survey units; develops hydrographic survey specifications; conducts technological development and application programs to increase efficiency in survey data acquisition; data processing, and chart production; and carries out research to develop techniques and methods for accomplishing these objectives.  The Office develops long-range program plans and objectives for marine charting, data base management and utilization, data dissemination, and related marine and coastal products and services.  

Marine Chart Division

The Marine Chart Division manages the national database of nautical charting and marine mapping information, the aggregation of information from external sources for database maintenance and the production of charting products. As a part of this mission, the Marine Division performs the following functions: 

1)	Promotes, directs and monitors the transition from traditional charting technologies to a more fully digital operation. 
2)	Directs the development of new nautical products and promotes and maintains communication with users. 
3)	Manages personnel and resources, and fosters efficiency. It represents U.S. civil mapping and charting interests to the general public and other private, public and international organizations. 
4)	Authorizes changes in standards and specifications.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY LICENSEE TO PRODUCE AND SELL AN ADAPTIVE PHOROPTOR FOR VISION EVALUATION AND CORRECTION
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY LICENSEE TO PRODUCE AND SELL AN ADAPTIVE PHOROPTOR FOR VISION EVALUATION AND CORRECTION


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking a company to license and commercialize a MEMS based Adaptive Optics Phoropter (MAOP), which is a system for vision evaluation and correction.  This MAOP system has recently received the R&D 100 Award for one of the 100 best new inventions in 2002.

Traditional phoropters can only correct for lower order aberrations (defocus and astigmatism). Unlike traditional phoropters, the MAOP system can diagnose and correct for lower and higher order (such as spherical aberrations, coma, etc.) aberrations.  Higher order aberrations have been clinically shown to increase with an individual’s age and effect factors such as contrast sensitivity. Correcting for higher order aberrations has been shown to be beneficial for patients undergoing laser eye surgery and for those suffering with extremely poor vision. Modules are currently being constructed that would enable the system to also perform retinal imaging. Enhanced retinal imaging would be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration.

The MEMS-based Adaptive Optics Phoropter is intended to replace the standard phoropter commonly used today by ophthalmologists and optometrists.  Patients will have nearly the same experience as they have today.  They will view a visual scene (e.g., an eye chart) through a viewport and then be asked to comment on whether the scene appears clearer (a subjective response).  The clinicians’ experience will also be similar, except they will not need to perform many of the manual steps required with standard phoropters.  However, in contrast, the results of the MAOP system will be significantly improved and more precise than today’s outcomes.

Visual acuity is degraded by aberrations in the cornea and lens of the eye. These aberrations distort the wavefront of the reflected light. The MAOP system is based on the use of adaptive optics to compensate for these aberrations and correct the wavefront. The wavefront corrector (MEMS based deformable mirror) applies the appropriate correction, automatically calculated by the wavefront sensor (Hartmann Shack type).  This objective information will then be combined with the subjective response from the patient so that the clinician and patient can attain the best correction and compensate for high-order aberrations.  The resulting wavefront information can then be used to specify an individualized prescription for custom contact lenses or custom laser eye surgery.

A copy of the most recent journal article is available at: http://www.llnl.gov/tid/lof/documents/pdf/243526.pdf

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Adaptive Phoropter should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 60-04

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Adaptive Phoropter.
