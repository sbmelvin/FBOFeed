  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.

<RESPDATE>040314
<CONTACT>Erin M. Riffey, Contract Specialist, Phone 785-320-6817, Email erin.riffey@fletc.dhs.gov - Jason A. Gerloff, Contracting Officer, Phone 785-320-4197, Email jason.gerloff@fletc.dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security/Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, will issue a solicitation, HSFLBP-14-R-00001, for construction of a Waste Water Thermal Decontamination System (WWTDS) Replacement for the existing system at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) on or about January 29, 2014. PIADC is a federally owned 840-acre island off the northeastern tip of Long Island, New York, and is located approximately 1.5 miles from Orient Point, New York, and approximately 12 miles from New London, Connecticut.
<p>There is a current need to replace the facility's existing WWTDS. The resulting contract will require construction of a new Bio-safety Level 3 Enhanced facility capable of decontaminating 65,000 gallons per day of raw sewage and animal waste. The decontamination system shall be a batch system using steam to heat the waste to 275 degrees Fahrenheit at 31 psig and holding the waste at that temperature and pressure for one hour. After treatment the waste shall be discharged to the sewage treatment plant at no more than 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Major components for the system to be provided as part of the construction include approximately 60,000 gallons of storage in carbon steel tanks for holding waste prior to treatment, five 3300 gallon stainless steel cook tanks, heat recovery heat exchangers to preheat the next batch of waste, sea water heat exchangers to achieve the final 80 degree Fahrenheit temperature, a solid separator system to remove the majority of un-digestible cellulose and non-organic solids, and a HEPA ventilation system for the facility. The facility will require information technology and security infrastructure to support a highly automated treatment system in a secure, monitored facility.</p>
<p>The solicitation is unrestricted, under NAICS Code 236220, with a size standard of $33,500,000. Contract award will be determined using the best value continuum as addressed at FAR 15.101. It is anticipated that the awarded contract will be firm-fixed price construction contract. Evaluation factors will include present/past performance, proposed key personnel, proposed staffing plan/organization, price, and other directly relevant factors identified in the RFP. The relevancy of present/past performance and other non-cost factors are significantly more important than cost or price.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a follow-on sole source contract to continue QuikSCAT satellite mission operations, engineering analysis of bus performance, contingency operations during anomalous events, and implementation of End of the Mission activities, if necessary, with the incumbent Ball Aerospace and Technology Corporation (BATC) located in Bolder, Colorado, in order to maintain the health and safety of the observatory through its science mission. <p> NASA/GSFC plans to award BATC a firm-fixed-price contract pursuant to 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, with an estimated period of performance of five years divided into one base-year and 4 one-year options. <p> The QuikSCAT satellite was launched on June 19, 1999. The mission was intended to be a 2-year mission with one option for a third year of operations. Currently, QuikSCAT is in its 15-year of mission operations and continues to provide useful data. <p> Under this follow-on contract, BATC will be responsible for flight operations of the QuikSCAT mission, consistent with existing mission operating procedures. Flight operations include activities necessary to maintain the health and safety of the spacecraft and instruments, mission planning and scheduling, engineering analysis, and mission operations ground system maintenance testing and integration. BATC will perform overall engineering analysis of spacecraft bus harness assembly and the performance to evaluate the health and safety of the spacecraft. BATC will be responsible for the planning, reviewing, testing, execution and evaluation of contingency operations during anomalous events or any events requiring special mission activity as agreed to by NASA; and the implementation of End of Mission activities in accordance with NASA policy, as agreed to by the QuikSCAT Project and the QuikSCAT End of Mission Plan. <p> BATC was the original contractor who built the spacecraft. For the past 15 years, BATC has maintained the QuikSCAT Satellite and continues to provide anomaly support. Ball Aerospace continues to monitor and maintain the health of the QuikSCAT spacecraft by collecting telemetry data, processing all health and status telemetry data and assess the performance of each spacecraft subsystem. The unique familiarity of the BATC team with QuikSCAT assets is an essential key to successfully achieving critical program goals. BATC has acquired unique experience and extensive knowledge resolving anomalies, developing workarounds, and modifying the procedures, techniques and approaches used to operate the aging spacecraft. <p> Only BATC possesses the detailed, unique, QuikSCAT-specific knowledge needed to assure the most efficient operation possible of the QuikSCAT aging spacecraft. The experience and understanding gained from past, technologically challenging QuikSCAT-specific work are critical to a high quality science operation, and even more critical to meeting the QuikSCAT mission goals and challenges that lie ahead to achieve maximum useful life. <p> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. Standard Time on January 27, 2014. <p> Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <p> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <p> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of Work</span>:</p>
<p>The Axio Zoom V16 will be used in NHGRI Undiagnosed Disease. Carl Zeiss Microscopy is able to combine accessories to build microscope units that contain all of the specific filters, objectives and documenting equipment necessary for the laboratory. The microscope will be uniquely built to incorporate all the of the lab requirements. A major required feature for all microscopes in the UDP laboratory are that they are capable of producing data that can be directly loaded into the ASSAY builder software which will allow for fully automatic, high-content analyses of images captured by the microscopy systems. This software is specifically designed for us with the microscopes from Carl Zeiss, and has been matched with the all software modules and automated hardware for their machines. Additionally, parts of the microscopes such as cameras, objectives, and filters must be fully interchangeable between all of the purchased microscopes and compatible with those that the UDP laboratory already possesses.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justification:</span></p>
<p>Provide the UDP laboratory a fluoresce-based stereo zoom microscope for analysis of adult and embryonic Danio rerio transgenic models to assess mutation incorporation, fluorescence analysis, and deposition of data into the UDP laboratory scientific notebook and digital repository for collaboration. The microscope must use the ZEN software platform and have the proper fluorescence data output to use the ASSAY builder analysis software already in use in the UDP laboratory. Additionally, parts of the microscopes such as cameras, objectives, and filters must be fully interchangeable between all of the purchased microscopes and compatible with existing Carl Zeiss Microscopes that the UDP laboratory already possesses.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance:</span></p>
<p>Products issued upon Award.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME). <br /><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis without providing for full and open competition to RuRo Inc. 321 Ballenger Center Drive, Suite 102, Frederick, Maryland 21703 to procure Sciency, Sync and User Seats Licenses for Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement:<br /><br /></span>Follow-On Requirement:</p>
<p>1. Clinician Access to UDP LIMS 24/7 Portal (Concurrent Seat/Access), Quantity: Twenty-Five (25).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program. Ultimately, the UDP offers patients the hope of a diagnosis and the possibility of therapeutic strategies. In return, patients provide UDP researchers the opportunity to gain new insights about genetic and biochemical mechanisms of disease and insights into normal cell biology, biochemistry and physiology. So far, UDP researchers have encountered patients with uncommon presentations of known disorders, multi-systemic complex disorders and new disorders that have never been diagnosed. UDP clinical researchers are using advances in DNA sequencing to detect defects in genes that point to known disorders. These tools offer the potential for discoveries about the role of molecular and biochemical events that can cause disease and, eventually, the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for rare and common diseases.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objective</span>:</p>
<p>Ruro, Inc. will provide the Undiagnosed Diseases Program with 25 Clinician Access Seats into the LIMS 24/7 Portal to allow them to input necessary UDP patient clinical data, view sample status and track the patient samples through the UDP laboratory and collaborator pipeline. The data is crucial for further laboratory testing and experimental design and must be tracked in the LIMS 24/7 Portal for laboratory access.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated Period of Performance</span>:</p>
<p>Delivery Upon Award</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justification</span>:</p>
<p>The multi-user nature of NIH's UDP Translational Laboratory, along with its dynamic process structures, engenders a deep set of requirements for any candidate data and project management system. The UDP has currently administered collaborator contracts to assist in the experimental pedigree of the projects derived from UDP patients. The addition of the Sciency collaborator license, sync service and additional Sciency user seats to the current laboratory notebook system, will allow for a real-time repository to effectively communicate results to the UDP staff. This will function as a point of collaboration between the institutions as all experimental results are disseminated through this laboratory notebook to necessary participants in research on UDP patients. This data will also be attached to the enterprise-grade LIMS 24/7 platform, which is a web-based system that encompasses project, task and asset management; user role configurability; user-tailored reporting; extensive audit functionality and information security. LIMS 24/7 is designed to be the meeting place of laboratory software tools, laboratory hardware, and staff users, allowing previously impossible levels of secure data access, communication and process efficiency. Clinician data input is an integral part in the experimental design and further testing that will and can be performed with the patient's samples and must be tracked with the samples in the UDP LIMS 24/7 portal. Additionally, collaborator access to Sciency with sync service capability must be added to the configuration that Ruro Inc. has designed for the UDP laboratory.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regulatory Authority</span>:</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

This contract will focus on historic preservation projects for cultural landscapes and historic structures primarily in park units in the Midwest Region (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota) with the secondary locations being the rest of the United States. The properties and related projects vary in complexity, scale and the matters to be addressed.  The properties are located within the National Park Service, Midwest Region units and National Historic Landmarks (NHLs) under a variety of ownerships. The Midwest Region contains nearly sixty individual parks, with over two thousand historic structures, over one thousand cultural landscapes and over four hundred NHLs.  The Midwest Region of the NPS includes nationally significant historic sites associated with Indian cultures, the fur trade, the exploration and opening of the American West, Civil War and frontier battles, presidential homes, and important 20th century developments in business, society and civil rights.  Additionally there are parks of scenic and natural beauty which include historic structures in cultural landscapes of local significance.  The NHLs present in the Midwest Region represent a large cross-section of American history and design.  They are among the nations most significant historic places, and while some are units within the National Park system, most are owned by other governmental agencies, non-profits, or private individuals.  The diverse NHLs include residences, farms, military, industrial and commercial complexes, designed and vernacular landscapes, monuments and cemeteries.  The sites represent the development of the Midwest and include not only vernacular designs but high style examples of French Colonial, Gothic, Queen Anne, Tudor, Classical Revival, Craftsman and Modern.  Most of the NPS properties are vernacular in nature.  These include: historic institutional or military complexes, such as life-saving stations, lighthouses, schools, and forts; industrial complexes, such as mines and mining town sites, steel producing and shipping districts; agricultural properties, such as those supporting farming, ranching, fishing and logging; historic transportation systems such as canals, railroads, roads, maritime and aviation properties; a large variety of homes and cabins ranging from Mandan-Hidatsa earth lodges, to resorts, to presidential homes, to model and modular houses.  Designed or relatively high-style properties include:  parks developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, parkways and recreational lodges, cabins and shelter structures; Beaux Arts- inspired landscapes, monuments, and memorials; institutional campuses, cemeteries and military parks; and unique artistic creations such as the Gateway Arch and Mount Rushmore.  The scope of work includes Predesign Services which may comprise primary and secondary historical research, field investigation, site survey, physical investigation and materials testing, condition assessment; Schematic Design Services including  treatment recommendations, conceptual designs, design guidelines, cost estimates, value analysis, asbestos and lead paint analysis, and other architectural/engineering work; Design Development and Construction Document Services including preparation of construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates and value engineering; and Construction Management such as inspection/ observation, site visits, consultation, review of submittals and shop drawings, and preparation of operation and maintenance manuals and as-built drawings. Required disciplines include historical landscape architecture; historical architecture; architectural history; soil, structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical engineering; National Environmental Policy Act compliance (Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements); sustainable design expertise; and certified value analysis experience.  Secondary support disciplines include geographic information systems (GIS) expertise, land use planning, materials and art conservation, surveying and dense cloud point mapping, historical research, horticulture of local and vintage plants, ecological restoration specialist, civil, environmental, and geotechnical engineering.  Construction work performed in historic buildings, landscapes or sites will require continuous attention to and compliance with historic preservation guidelines.  All work will be guided by NPS policies and directives, however historic resources often present unique and unusual conditions and the NPS encourages creativity in the development of preservation methods. Projects will require coordination with various review and planning entities.  Prospective firms shall demonstrate past experience with cultural landscapes and historic structures, archaic building and landscape materials and compatible contemporary design.  EVALUATION CRITERIA The following criteria in descending order of importance shall be used in the evaluation of the prospective firms: 1. Professional qualifications of the firm and staff proposed for satisfactory performance of desired services; 2.The firm demonstrates substantial specialized experience and technical competence as prime contractor or as a consultant on historic preservation projects for the National Park Service or other public/government or non-profit agencies(such as Historic Structures Reports, Cultural Landscape Reports, Environmental Impact Statements/Environmental Assessments, Landscape Preservation Maintenance Plans, and National Register of Historic Places Nominations). It is preferred that both the prime contractor and sub-contractors have demonstrated past experience with sensitive design within historic properties; 3. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. In addition, the A/E firm shall: a. Demonstrate expertise in preparing required compliance documents associated with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), such as Environmental Impact Statements and Environmental Assessments, especially past performance with NEPA compliance on cultural resource projects.  b. Demonstrate expertise in conducting value analysis (VA) at planning and pre-design stages, as well as the more traditional value engineering (VE) studies. The firm shall also demonstrate expertise in utilization of value methods in decision making e.g. Choosing by Advantages (CBA), functional analysis e.g. FAST diagram, life cycle cost analysis, importance(benefit) to cost graphing or other method of evaluating non-monetary benefits; enabling and assisting the NPS to make benefit cost decisions and comparisons. A/E shall identify facilitator(s) with Certified Value Specialist certification or approved equal, to conduct studies and consult with the prime with regard to decision making methods.; 4. Capacity to accomplish multiple projects within the desired time schedule and to manage multi-faceted projects within schedule.  The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  Sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities.  Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices.

<div>Firm Term:<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>5 years</div>
<div>Option Term:<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>0 years</div>
<div>Additional Requirements:<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Subleases are not acceptable.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Government currently occupies leased office and related space under a lease that will be expiring. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government&rsquo;s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>A review of the Federal Emergency Management Agency&rsquo;s (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Map 51059C0295E, revised September 17, 2010, and the Letter of Map Revision, effective November 23, 2010, indicate portions of the property on which the existing leased space is located are in the base floodplain, making it susceptible to flooding at or above the 100-year flood level. &nbsp;Compliance with the President&rsquo;s Executive Order (EO) 11988: Floodplain Management and GSA&rsquo;s Floodplain Management Desk Guide (1999) is required for any proposed action that may occur in a floodplain. &nbsp;These regulations direct GSA to avoid base floodplains unless it is determined that there is no practicable alternative and to carry out the eight-step process, which the agency has established in order to implement the provisions of Executive Order 11988. The Government may decide there is no practicable alternative to remaining at the existing location. As the existing leased space may represent the only practicable alternative for GSA&rsquo;s proposed leasing action, in compliance with EO 11988, GSA has decided to carry out the eight-step process, which requires the identification of mitigation measures. &nbsp;</div>
<div>In response to this request for Expressions of Interest, the incumbent Lessor must offer flood plain mitigation measures (e.g. flood insurance, flood barriers, etc.) and indicate the line item cost of such mitigation measures, or confirm that the costs are included in the offered rental rate. &nbsp;The costs of the incumbent Lessor's mitigation measures shall be considered in the cost benefit analysis described above.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>The required occupancy date is no later than May 21, 2015. &nbsp;Whether or not an offered building can meet the required occupancy date is in the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>Buildings offered for consideration must have the ability to meet all current Federal/GSA/PBS, State, and Local codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, handicapped accessibility, and OSHA by the required occupancy date per the terms of the Lease. &nbsp;The building must also have the ability to meet certain building and energy efficiencies in accordance with the Energy Independence and Security Act. &nbsp;The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced. Offered space shall not be in a flood plain unless there are no practicable alternatives.<br />&nbsp;</div>

<DESC>1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation, but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.<br /><br />1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334511, which have a corresponding Size standard of 750 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran&shy; Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. <br /><br />2. Program Details:<br /><br />2.1 The following information is provided to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully provide the described capability. AFLCMC/WWMPA F-16 System Program Office, Integration Section, Hill AFB, UT intends to award a contract to design, manufacture, and test a prototype adapter to the AN/ALM-288 tester. The ALM-288 is the support equipment that simulates the release of countermeasures from the aircraft via signals it receives from the AN/ALQ-213 Electronic Warfare Management System. With the current Pylon Integrated Dispenser System Universal (PIDSU), the ALM-288 is inserted into one of the PIDSU's three pylon magazine chambers to accomplish testing. USAF has recently flight tested and SEEK EAGLE certified a modification to the PIDSU that cants the countermeasure magazines downward and replaces the PIDSU breech plate. This modification impacts the ALM-288's ability to fit and interface with the modified PIDSU; therefore an adapter to the ALM-288 is required.
<p>This action is being conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for the following:</p>
<p>a. The potential source shall develop a prototype adapter to the AN/ALM-288, enabling the ALM-288 to connect with the USAF flight-tested, modified PIDSU pylon.</p>
<p>b. All functions native to the ALM-288, including countermeasure release simulation and stray voltage testing, shall be maintained.</p>
<p>c. The potential source shall be able to demonstrate a thorough technical understanding of the F-16 Blocks 25/30/32, the PIDSU pylon (both current and modified version) and the ALQ-213 system.</p>
<p>d. The potential source shall consider field usability and sustainability into its adapter design, including efficient methods of removing the adapter from the PIDSU.<br />e. The potential source shall provide engineering and program management support for formal reviews and tests throughout the design and testing process. This includes supporting government presence at a contractor testing site, and contractor support at a government testing site.</p>
<p>f. The potential source shall develop and deliver prototype retainer plates to support future USAF testing. These retainer plates interface between the PIDSU breech plate and its countermeasure magazines, and identify the type of countermeasure to be loaded.</p>
<p>g. Technical data, technical reports, design drawings, and instructions for usage, installation, and maintenance shall all be required.<br />h. It is estimated that the required delivery for a fully qualified hardware will be no later than six (6) months after receipt of order (ARO).</p>
<p>3. This is a request for information seeking sources capable of meeting the requirements in the attached Purchase Description. When responding please include:</p>
<p>a. Company Name and Cage code.</p>
<p>b. Who is your POC? Please provide an email address and phone number.</p>
<p>c. Please describe your experiences with the same or similar items. Also describe how you would address the requirements in Section 2, letters a. through h.</p>
<p>d. Suggested NAICS Code.</p>
<p>e. Business Size Classification for NAICS and qualifications if any and any sub-category.</p>
<p>f. Would you be a prime or subcontractor?</p>
<p>g. Lead Time for the task performance.</p>
<p>All responses can be submitted to the POC via e-mail or fax.</p>

<DESC>Description:  NASA Ames Research Center is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for providing Facilities Maintenance Services at NASA Ames Research Center. The broad scope of the requirement includes the facility maintenance services necessary for a large campus environment consisting of approximately 125 facilities spread over an area exceeding 1800 acres. The facilities range in purpose from general office activities to state of the art research facilities and range in age from relatively new to over 70 years old. The Facilities Support Services requirement includes: Planning and implementation of a comprehensive maintenance program covering the following Technical Areas: electrical; mechanical; plumbing; pipefitting; infrastructure utility services; heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC/R) services; environmental services required in performance of this effort; maintenance engineering; grounds maintenance; and building trade services. The Contractor shall be required to determine what should be maintained, the appropriate level of maintenance, performance of the maintenance tasks, measurement of the effectiveness of maintenance to determine adequacy of the program, and redesign of portions of the program to assist in achieving effective results. Critical to this process will be the ability to apply modern maintenance management techniques such as Reliability Centered Maintenance strategies to determine the optimum mix of preventive, predictive, reactive, and proactive maintenance practices. Another important requirement will be the operation and maintenance of existing automated systems for planning and management of the maintenance process as well as the implementation of additional techniques to lower operations and maintenance costs. <p> This request relates to the planning activities associated with the follow-on requirement for Facility Maintenance Services. The work will be performed primarily at Ames Research Center (ARC), Moffett Field, California. <p> CURRENT CONTRACT FEATURES: The current NASA Ames Facilities Maintenance Services Contract NNA10DF30C with IAP World Services, Inc. has the following features: <p> 1) Period of Performance: 10/01/10 to 9/30/15. 2) Contract Type: Combination FFP/IDIQ/CPFF. 3) The contract was awarded under Full and Open Competition. 4) The current value of the contract is approximately $101,828,928. <p> PART I. PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <p> This RFI has two purposes: <p> 1) To request information, stated in Part III of this RFI, from interested parties regarding their recommended contracting approach, including contract type, incentive structure and contract duration, to provide the facilities maintenance services described above. The Government is also seeking input on how to make any future contract for this effort scalable to allow timely and simple changes to the work content and contract value in the event we must adapt to declining budget scenarios during the period of performance. All acquisition methods are being considered by the Government including the potential use of Federal Schedules. <p> 2) To request information on capabilities/qualifications of potential Offerors to provide the services described in the technical areas stated in Part II of this RFI in order to determine if this requirement is appropriate for a small business set-aside. Information received as a result of this section will be considered by the Government and used for acquisition planning purposes only. Please note, a decision to set-aside this requirement for small business or to compete it through full and open procedures has not yet been made. An interested parties list will be posted. <p> *Note: Responses to Part I of this RFI are not requested. <p> PART II. RESPONSES REGARDING THE CAPABILITIES/QUALIFICATIONS OF POTENTIAL SOURCES: <p> Interested Offerors having the required specialized capabilities/qualifications to support some or all of the work described in the Description Section of this RFI are asked to submit a description of their capability/qualifications in 10 pages or less (including any exhibits, attachments, etc) that must include the following: <p> 1) Provide your company name, address, point of contact, phone, fax, e-mail, and website (if applicable). <p> 2) State whether your company is a Large business, Small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, certified 8(a) small business (include anticipated graduation date), HUBZone small business, Woman-owned small business, Veteran-owned small business, HBCU/MI, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business for NAICS code 561210, size standard $32.5M in average annual receipts. <p> 3) State whether your company is on any Federal Schedule for these services and which ones they are. <p> 4) Describe your companys maintenance and repair capability and capacity in each of the Technical Areas listed in the Description Section above. <p> 5) Provide a list of relevant work performed in the past five (5) years, including contract type, contract number, technical description and how it is relevant to this work, dollar amount, period of performance, and a customer reference name and telephone number. <p> 6)  Discuss your ability to effectively use, operate, and maintain a Government furnished facility automation system over a large network monitoring approximately 125 buildings in a combination airfield and research laboratory environment. <p> 7)  Discuss your knowledge, understanding, and compliance with Federal, State, and local regulations as well as policies pertaining to environmental, health, and safety issues in implementing a maintenance program. <p> 8)  In the event recent budgetary trends continue, the Center could continue to face a decline in the amount of funds available to support investment in our facilities during the ultimate period of performance of this projected contract.  While we are unable at this time to characterize this, and while we will advocate to avoid this scenario, we must be prepared, and hence must plan, for year-over-year reductions of 2% to 10% on a projected overall contract value of $80 to $100M.	The key to this will be balancing flexibility and agility with providing a sound and at least minimally compliant facilities approach.  If the Government wanted to achieve timely cost savings, please describe how you would best accommodate this declining budget environment, maintain optimal scalability, and implement directed cost savings to the Government within 30 calendar days of such a decision and still meet contractual requirements. <p> 9)  Based on the description of the facilities on ARC and Moffett Field (Attachment #1), what would be the yearly estimated budget to perform all necessary preventive, predictive, reactive, and proactive maintenance.  Which of these areas does the Contractor predict to be the largest cost driver and which area would present the greatest opportunity to realize cost savings through innovative practices in execution? <p> 10)  Discuss your experience in using computerized maintenance management system(s). Assess the degree to which Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) concepts are in place or are being implemented and integrated into maintenance programs by your company. Discuss your experience using Predictive Testing and Inspection (PT&I) technologies and equipment.  What is the extent of your knowledge and usage of PT&I technologies in assessing and/or analyzing plant equipment? <p> The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses. <p> PART III. RESPONSES REGARDING THE CONTRACTING APPROACH: <p> The Government is soliciting industry comments on the optimal contracting approach to perform a potential Facilities Maintenance Services procurement that will enhance competition and provide business opportunities. Responses to Part III must be in 5 pages or less (including any exhibits, attachments, etc) and include the following: <p> 1) Please provide your view regarding what type of contract provides the best approach for this type of work, how should the risk be shared by the Government and Contractor, and how does the proposed contract type incentivize the Contractor to perform high quality work at a reasonable price and maximize scalability over the life of the contract? Discuss your views regarding the implementation of incentive fees, award fees, performance deduction schedules, award term(s), bonuses, and/or other appropriate incentives for contractor performance. <p> 2) Service contracts are typically limited to five year durations unless a deviation is approved. Is five years the appropriate duration or is a shorter period appropriate to take advantage of competitive forces, or would it be in ARCs best interest to seek a deviation to the five year limitation  what would be the Government benefit of a longer term, how would a longer term maximize NASAs return on investment, etc.? <p> 3)  As a result of potential fiscal constraints and budgeting fluctuations, how would the Contractor recommend structuring any potential future contract to allow for periods of reduced support while still meeting all legal and essential operational requirements to maintain ARC?  <p> 4) What would help reduce the Contractors bid and proposal or transaction costs during any potential proposal development and evaluation process for this effort? <p> 5) Socio-economic considerations are a priority at ARC.  Given the general scope of work stated in the Description section of this RFI, please submit suggested percentages of the work that could be subcontracted to  each of the following types of businesses: Small Business Concerns; Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Concerns; Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Concerns; HUBZone Small Business Concerns; Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) (includes other minority Institutions); Veteran-Owned Business Concerns; and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Concerns. This information may be used to establish subcontracting goals for any future procurement.  <p> PART IV. INSTRUCTIONS ON SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI: <p> All responses to Part II and III of this RFI shall be received no later than February 3, 2014. Please respond via electronic mail (e-mail) to the Contract Specialist, Robert M. Benion, at the following address: Robert.m.benion@nasa.gov.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> JSC is seeking co-development partners with similar interest in developing and demonstrating relevant technologies associated with Green Propulsion. <P> NASA is currently developing Green Propulsion technologies including, but not limited to: main and reaction control engine development, integrated systems testing including use of the Morpheus vertical test bed, innovative low mass/volume pressurant storage and distribution solutions, low mass/thermally efficient composite propellant tanks and structures, and advanced materials and manufacturing for low cost component production. Green Propulsion technologies are of great interest to the aerospace industry.  These technologies also have relevance to any entity that desires the ability to generate environmentally friendly power and propulsion. <p> Technology: <p> NASA JSC has a long history in the development of propulsion systems for human-rated in-space vehicles and landers.  Traditionally, these systems have used earth storable propellants that provide adequate performance but are encumbered by significant test and operational impacts associated with their high toxicity.  Additionally, earth storable propellants are not compatible with in-situ propellant production/in-situ resource utilization (ISPP/ISRU), which is considered enabling for human missions to Mars.  LO2/CH4 propulsion offers the advantage of increased performance, low toxicity, and ISRU compatibility and has been identified by NASA as an enabling technology for Mars human mission architecture. The propellant combination supports a high degree of integration between Propulsion, Power, and the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) enabling common vehicle fluids and storage solutions.  By minimizing the number of fluids on the spacecraft and consolidating tankage, the integrated spacecraft fluid storage architecture could realize significant mass reductions and systems packaging efficiency at the vehicle level. <p> R&D Status: <p> JSC has been working in collaboration with the Morpheus Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) project, the University of Texas El Paso Center for Space Exploration Technology Research, and Penn State University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) to further the development and demonstration of key technologies necessary to enable a LO2/CH4 spacecraft and/or lander propulsion system.  <p> As part of the Morpheus AES project, JSC has developed and is operating a versatile platform to support integrated vehicle-level test and demonstration of spacecraft systems including non-toxic propellant technologies, integrated propulsion/avionics/Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) architectures, and Autonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT).  The Morpheus vertical test bed has the ability to fly analog trajectories such as Lunar descent using LO2/Methane propulsion for low-cost testing with rapid recycle time. <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <p> 	 Thermodynamic Vent System for On-Orbit Cryogenic Reaction Control Engine, NASA Tech Briefs, May 2012. <p> 	 Regeneratively Cooled Combustor Equilibrium Tool for Matlab (RCCET-M) Version 1, NASA Technology Report, May 11 2012. <p> 	Automated, Real-Time Targeting and Guidance (ARTGUID) Software for Lunar-Descent and Precision Landing <p> Reference Papers: <p> 	AIAA 2013-5310, Project Morpheus: Lessons Learned in Lander Technology Development <p> 	Global Exploration Conference, May 2012, GLEX-2012.05.2.4x12761, Morpheus: Advancing Technologies for Human Exploration <p> 	JANNAF, 2011-0015LV, 2-Inch Piezoelectric Isolation Valve Tested on an Integrated Cryogenic Feed System <p> 	AIAA-2011-5775, Characterization of Propellant Distribution for a Cryogenic Attitude Control System <p> 	AIAA-2011-5633, Slosh Baffle Design and Test for Spherical Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Methane Propellant Tank for a Lander <p> 	AIAA-2011-6113, Advanced Development of a Compact 5-15 lbf LOX/Methane Thruster for an Integrated Reaction Control and Main Engine Propulsion System <p> 	AIAA-2011-5927, Project Morpheus Main Engine Development and Preliminary Flight Testing <p> Detailed information for the above mentioned technologies furnished upon request. <p> This co-development project may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> JSC is seeking partners to further Hydrogen and Hydrocarbon, Air Independent Fuel Cells technology. NASA JSC has a long history in the development of fuel cell systems using pure oxygen as the oxidant and pure hydrogen as the fuel.  Such a system was the primary power source for the Space Shuttle Orbiter. Along with spacecraft applications, these solutions could enhance mission capability in remotely operated subsea vehicles independent of surface power sources.  <p> Technology: <p> For future spacecraft power, NASA will require air-independent fuel cells and plans to push this technology in three directions:  (1) higher reliability, (2) higher-temperature heat rejection, and (3) efficient use of fuel from reformed hydrocarbons.  Potential solutions for the first requirement include dead-headed fuel cells of any chemistry, which have no active components for reactant management in the balance-of-plant. Potential solutions for the other two requirements center on solid oxide fuel cell chemistries.  These chemistries can operate above 800 oC, which can minimize the mass of heat rejection radiators, and can utilize both carbon monoxide and hydrogen as fuel, thus minimizing the stages required to reform hydrocarbon fuel sources. <p> R&D Status: <p> JSC has been working in collaboration with the US Navy to conduct testing programs and understand the system integration issues associated with potential solutions.  <p> Intellectual Property (IP):  This Partner relationship may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided.

JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <P> Purpose: <P> NASA JSC seeks to advance the technology readiness of aluminum wiring for aerospace, aircraft and other applications where weight is a factor.  Our goal is to reduce the mass of aerospace vehicles by replacing the copper wiring with aluminum wiring.  To determine if the aluminum wiring and associated connectors can be used in the space environment, the wiring must be tested and analyzed to create a standard that must be adhered to for aerospace vehicles. <P> Technology: <P> Replacing copper wiring with aluminum wiring involves an end-to-end systems approach including connectors, crimping techniques and all facets of the wiring system.	The testing and analysis of an aluminum wiring system must be compatible and consistent with the standard wiring practices now employed by NASA, the DoD and commercial aircraft. The results must be repeatable and reliable. Any usage data or lessons learned from current or previous applications in the aerospace environments would be beneficial. <P> R&D Status: <P> Aluminum wiring is currently in use in European spacecraft and airplanes, but NASA has limited access to the data and testing standards.  As such, while much of the research and development may have been done, an industry standard does not exist to allow common use throughout the aerospace and aircraft industries. <P> Intellectual Property (IP): <P> This Partner relationship may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <P> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> NASA JSC seeks parties interested in co-developing technology associated with Composite Sandwich Habitable Pressurized Structures (CSHPS).  <p> CSHPS technology includes permeability, radiation and Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris (MM/OD) shielding which are built into the structure along with embedded sensor technology for structural and thermal health monitoring.  This co-development opportunity focuses on advancing the technology in design, analysis and manufacturing of a multi-functional composite structural system through the fabrication of a habitable composite cabin structure.  <p> This technology can be modified and adapted to accommodate many applications that can benefit from lightweight, thermally protected and impact resistant habitable structures. <p> Technology: <p> Over the past two years, NASA JSC has been leading the design, fabrication, and testing of multi-functional structural sandwich panels constructed of composite face sheets and metallic foam core.   Evaluations of these panels have demonstrated that this structural system has a high potential to successfully be utilized in design and fabrication of large habitable structures.  In 2012, composite tooling was designed, fabricated and used in the manufacture of a solid laminate structure.  The objective of this effort was to use these tools to manufacture a multi-functional cabin structure.  This structure will be pressure and modal tested and subsequently outfitted with an internal structure to simulate a deep space Advanced Exploration System (AES). <p> Currently, NASA JSC is bonding the MM/OD shielding with high and low density foam core and performing mechanical testing to understand the synergism of a focused, system designed structure.  Analytical models for structural and environmental response are being developed and correlated to test data. The resultant structure is being built into prototypes at component and full-scale levels.	The fundamental objectives are to save mass (~20%) and volume by incorporating capability into (not onto) the structure. The end goal is a human-rated, single wall vehicle technology with pressure inside and Thermal Protection System (TPS) outside.  More specifically, this effort intends to provide a platform for space vehicle applications. <p> NASA JSC is currently on track to narrow-down/define design parameters and to begin producing demonstrators to enable advancement toward production with notable capability at significant weight savings. Products include test data, demo hardware and reports. <p> The proposed sandwich composite system using an aluminum foam core has never been utilized in a habitable structure configuration.  Material/System configuration property development and damage tolerance require significant resources for testing. Additionally, manufacturing processes for large complex structures have yet to be demonstrated.  <p> R&D Status: <p> This technology has become part of the Human Asteroid Lander (HAL)/ Multi-mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV), supports Lagrange Point 2 (L2) habitable vehicles, and is tied to Dryden Research Center (DRC) test development and Ames Research Center (ARC) composite heat shield development.  <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <p> 	Multi-Functional Composite Structure for Deep Space 	Inside-Out Manufacturing of Multifunctional Composite Structures <p> Detailed information for the above mentioned technologies furnished upon request. <p> This co-development project may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> NASA is seeking parties interested in co-developing technology associated with low launch volume, lightweight, durable inflatable structures. <p> Space structure engineers and designers have identified inflatables as a lightweight and durable supplement to current human spaceflight architectures. NASA has recognized a number of potential applications for the versatile technology including use as an airlock for spacewalking astronauts, an expandable living space for crewed spacecraft on long duration missions, an inflatable habitat on a planetary surface, and even a bag to capture and return an asteroid. <p> In addition to having significant benefits in space, inflatable structures also possess numerous earth applications, including but not limited to: quickly deployable-durable habitats, hyperbaric chambers, deployable shock absorbers, storm surge protection devices, pipeline fluid plugs, and fluid stowage containers. <p> Technology: <p> Engineers at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) are currently offering co-development opportunities focusing on four important technologies necessary for improving the performance of inflatable structures: <p> 1.  The development of a flexible, inflatable bladder capable of maintaining elasticity in the harsh cold of space (-50 Fahrenheit) and exhibiting a low permeability to minimize the chance for leaks. Such a structure could also serve as a cold temperature storage tank for numerous industries here on earth. <p> 2.  Analysis and testing of high strength and high stiffness advanced materials like Kevlar or Vectran to verify their potential as construction materials and optimize micrometeoroid/orbital debris and passive thermal protection systems to minimize mass required for long-term space missions. <p> 3.  Innovative ways to monitor the health of inflatables and conduct repairs. Engineers are especially interested in developing non-invasive monitoring of structural layers and low power methods of sensing important traits like pressure, temperature, strain and radiation exposure.   4.  Methods for integrating substructures into large inflatables.  Air beams can provide secondary support structure for habitats and airlocks and serve as the main support structure for an inflatable asteroid capture bag. <p> R&D Status: <p> Currently the main areas of research are being undertaken by NASA and Bigelow Aerospace. NASA is currently studying inflatable lunar bases with the planetary surface habitat and airlock unit, which is in an early prototype phase, and has conceptual proposals for utilizing expandable-technology space structures in cislunar and interplanetary-crewed exploration spacecraft. <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <p> Patents awarded: <p> 	Advanced Structural and Inflatable Spacecraft Module- US 6,231,010; <p> 	Portable Hyperbaric Chamber- US 6,321,746; <p> 	Inflatable Vessel and Method- US 6,547,189; <p> 	System and Method of Designing a Load Bearing Layer of an Inflatable Vessel- US 7,295,884; <p> 	Apparatus for Integrating a Rigid Structural into a Flexible Wall of an Inflatable Structure; US 7,509,774. <p> 	Exploration Launch-Optimized Folding Top (X-LOFT) <p> 	Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) vertical cylinder habitat <p> Detailed information for the above mentioned technologies furnished upon request. <p> This co-development project may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided.

<p>1.1 Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane in support of the EA-6B, EA-18G, P8-A, and CEASAR programs is seeking information in regards to contractor who can provide supplies under the following Federal Supply Codes (FSC); 1280, 1550, 1560, 1660, 1680, 1740, 2840, 3010, 3020, 3130, 3439, 4010, 4130, 4140, 4370, 4710, 4720, 4730, 4820, 4920, 5120, 5305, 5306, 5307, 5310, 5315, 5320, 5325, 5330, 5331, 5340, 5342, 5355, 5360, 5362, 5365, 5370, 5485, 5590, 5811, 5820, 5835, 5840, 5841, 5862, 5865, 5868, 5905, 5910, 5915, 5920, 5925, 5930, 5935, 5940, 5945, 5950, 5955, 5960, 5961, 5962, 5963, 5970, 5975, 5977, 5980, 5985, 5990, 5995, 5996, 5998, 5999, 6020, 6105, 6110, 6115, 6130, 6135, 6145, 6150, 6210, 6220, 6230, 6240, 6250, 6350, 6615, 6625, 6645, 6680, 6685, 6930, 7010, 7021, 7025, 7690, 9535, 9905. A complete list of items will be included as an attachment to this RFI.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>Due to the need to provide supplies in support of the EA-6B, EA-18G, P8-A, and CEASAR programs, the Navy is looking for interested contractors who can provide supplies under the FSC codes identified in section 1.1 of this RFI. The Navy is considering issuing a Multiple Award Contract (MAC) to fulfill this requirement. A list of all items will be included as an attachment to this RFI. It's the Government's preference that all respondees be able to provide supplies in all FSC's, however, this may not be a realistic expectation.</p>
<p>Ideally, the Government would like to find multiple contractors who can provide all of the items listed in the attachment. If a solicitation is issued at a later date, the Government's preference would be to compete each requirement among the awardees and issue job orders/delivery orders based on pre-established evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>3.0 Responses</p>
<p>3.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>3.2 White papers in Microsoft Word for Office 2010 compatible format are due no later than 27 February 2014, 3:00 PM EST. Responses shall be limited to 5 pages and submitted via e-mail only to matt.burkett@navy.mil Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Submissions will be reviewed by NSWC Crane personnel.</p>
<p>3.3. Section 1 of the white paper shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum:</p>
<p>3.3.1. Name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail of designated point of contact.</p>
<p>3.3.2. What FSC codes you can support and which ones you can't support.</p>
<p>3.3.3. Is your company an authorized distributer for any of the items called out in the attachment to this RFI?</p>
<p>3.3.4. Information is requested as to the methods utilized to verify the authenticity of procured parts, in order to ensure the parts are new parts from the Original Equipment Manufacturer.</p>

<CONTACT>Vincent J Sanchez, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-875-6629, Email SanchezVJ@state.gov - Bernard L. Turner, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-875-4224, Email turnerb1@state.gov
<DESC><p>1. Background<br />The Department of State (DOS) Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), Security Infrastructure (SI), Office of Personnel Security and Suitability (PSS) has developed a Continuous Evaluation (CE) Program. The CE program addresses guidelines set forth in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and Executive Order 13467 of 2008.<br />The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) established the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The ODNI in collaboration with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and other Government agencies outlined several strategic goals to address IRTPA, as part of the clearance reform process. One of these strategic goals was for agencies to establish a Continuous Evaluation process. Continuous Evaluation will provide a mechanism by which cleared individuals would be investigated more frequently, and thereby reducing risk to national security<br />Executive Order 13467 of June 2008 amended Executive Order 12968 of August 1995, by requiring that "an individual who has been determined to be eligible for, or who currently has access to classified information, shall be subject to continuous evaluation (CE)."<br />2. Product and Services Description<br />The product and services potentially required are for a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Security Survey System to support the CE Program. The Security Survey System, a critical part of the overall CE Program, will include the ability to create, manage, distribute, and track Security Surveys. The Security Survey System will include the ability to have staff profiles on individuals. In addition, the Security Survey System will allow individuals with profiles to self-report key life events or activates.</p>
<p>2.1. Functional Requirements <br />As the Security Survey System is part of a larger solution, the system must be able to import and export data in a structured format, preferably XML. The Security Survey System will receive data from Human Resource (HR) systems and other security systems. This data will be used to create and maintain staff profiles. The system must have error checking and handling, and the ability to reconcile incoming data to existing staff profiles, including to create an account if no account exists based upon data from another system. The system must have the ability to export, in a structured format, any staff profile data or survey data to other systems including HR and other security systems. <br />The Security Survey System must have the ability to support customization of the User Interface (UI) for DOS branding and standards to be applied. These customizations include, but are not limited to, applying DOS logo, changing colors, and some amount of page layout including headers and footers with links to other sites. In addition, the system must support adding and managing fields and field names in the staff profiles. <br />The Security Survey System must have the ability to create and manage staff profiles. Data in a staff profile could include staff member's unique information including name, SSN, date of birth, place of birth, Passport Number, network log, and other unique identifiers. The staff profile could also include staff member's job related information including current and former job titles, assignments (Post / Region / Location), accesses / special programs, supervisors, and peers. In addition, the staff profile must store and make accessible any surveys completed by user. The system must support management of the staff profiles including automated and manual creation, modification, merging, deleting, and archiving (exporting content into another system).</p>
<p>The Security Survey System must have the ability to create and manage multiple surveys. Surveys must be able to utilize text boxes, radio buttons (yes/no), scales (on a scale of X to X), multiple choice questions allowing multiple answers, and branching questions. Surveys must be able to be managed including having multiple surveys, question pools, randomly assign questions to surveys, developed reference support (recipient must recommend X number of other users to receive surveys), assign values or weighting to questions, assign triggers to questions, assign notifications for trigger results (via e-mail or other means), and manage trigger notifications (group or role to route triggered event).</p>
<p>The Security Survey System must have the ability to create and maintain instructions / help files. The system must allow for instruction / help files to be created and associated with a certain part of the system including user profiles and surveys. The system must support maintaining instructions / help file that could include instructions on related policies, general guidance, links to other resources such as SharePoint, detailed system functions, and contact information to obtain further information or directly contact support (e-mail link).</p>
<p>The Security Survey System must have the ability to manage the survey process. The system must be able to send out surveys both manually and automated based upon rules. The rules must be configurable based upon defined criteria, such as dates. The system must allow a survey to be manually taken back and rerouted to a different user. The Security Survey System must have the ability to manage and view completed security surveys. The system must allow a rejected survey to be rerouted to a different user. <br />The Security Survey System must have the ability to allow a recipient of a survey to receive and track one or multiple surveys assigned to them, reject a survey (with reason / comment), save survey in progress, see percent complete of a survey, spell check survey, access previously completed surveys, e-mail copy to self, print copy, and access instruction / help files. <br />The Security Survey System must have the ability to track and report on surveys in progress and completed. The system must track status of surveys (opened, percent complete), automated and manual sending of e-mail notifications to survey recipients (new survey, incomplete survey, and deadlines). The system must have reporting functions on both the survey process and survey results. The system must have the ability to prioritize surveys for review based upon results of a survey and defined by triggers. So the answering of a triggered question in a certain manner could result in an action for a user to review that survey within X days. If that survey is not reviewed, a notification results (via e-mail or other means).</p>
<p>The Security Survey System must support staff profile self-reporting of key life events. The Security Survey System must have the ability to create and manage self-reporting surveys or forms; each type of self-reporting survey will have unique data fields. The system must support management of multiple self-reporting surveys or forms. Surveys must be able to utilize text boxes, radio buttons (yes/no), scales (on a scale of X to X), multiple choice questions allowing multiple answers, and branching questions. The system must allow self-reporting surveys to be saved in progress, see percent complete of a survey, spell check of survey, access previous completed self-report surveys, e-mail copy to self, print copy, access instruction / help files help files. The system must allow triggers to be created to send follow up surveys based upon answers in their self-reporting survey. The system must allow for sending notifications for trigger results (via e-mail or other means), and manage trigger notifications (group or role to route triggered event). The system must allow for assigning values to questions, assigning triggers to questions, assign notifications for trigger results, and manage notifications (via e-mail or other means) based upon trigger. <br />The Security Survey System must have role based permissions with the ability to control permissions and accesses based upon predefined roles. These roles will determine which users can create and accounts / profiles, modify survey forms either system sent or self-reporting, which users can create and modify triggers and routing of triggered results, as well as basic user functions such as completing surveys.<br />The Security Survey System must have the ability to log events. The system must log both system managed or automated events and manual events. This logging could include, but is not limited to, transaction logs related to importing or exporting data, creation and/or modifications of profiles, creation and/or modifications of surveys, creation and/or modifications of triggers and results of triggers, and activity related to completion of surveys.<br />2.2. Technical Requirements <br />The Security Survey System must support Federal Government and DOS specific technical requirements including Section 508, Single Sign-on, encryption, and Certification and Accreditation. <br />The Security Survey System must meet Section 508 compliance standards, ensuring the system can be used by people with disabilities. This includes providing a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) and providing supporting information on how the product meets Section 508 standards. <br />The Security Survey System must comply with Title III of the E-Government Act of December 2002, entitled the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). DOS has implemented FISMA controls in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards as defined in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 and 200, and guidelines Special Publications (SP) 800-series including SP 800-53. The provider must be able to support the development of a System Security Plan with implemented and documented security controls in accordance with a moderate level system, and leading to Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A). <br />The Security Survey System must support Single Sign-on utilizing Microsoft Windows Active Directory services. The system must be able to link DOS network credentials to accounts with roles and permissions. <br />The Security Survey System must support encryption of data at rest and data in motion.<br />2.3. Technical Services <br />The provider of the Security Survey System must be able to provide technical services on customer site. These services include but are not limited to installation and configuration support, customization support, training, and C&amp;A support. <br />2.4. Optional Functional Requirements <br />Optional functional requirements are desired or enhanced capabilities, but may or may not be potentially required for the Security Survey System to be successful, depending on industry response to this notice. <br />The Security Survey System optionally would have the ability to maintain training records associated with staff profiles and manage training material. Based upon results of surveys, either completed by others or self-reporting, the system would allow training material to be made available for completion by a user. This training material would consist of a number of PowerPoint slide shows. The system would allow a user to make available to another user one or more of the slide shows. The system would allow the user to review / complete and certify understanding of the training material. The system would allow tracking of training (opened, percent complete), automated and manual sending of e-mail notifications to training recipients (new training, incomplete training and deadlines). The system would allow all training information ongoing and completed to be made available in that user profile. The system would allow reporting functions on training progress and results.</p>
<p>There seem to be two (2) distinct IT architecture solutions being employed by industry for these types of products. A Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product model is preferred over a SaaS model. The SaaS model involves the provider hosting the software and associated data on their internet access architecture or "cloud." This model poses several challenges. Due to the unique and sensitive nature of the data that will be stored in the system meeting Government security requirements both physical and logic would greatly increase costs. No potential SaaS provider had a FedRAMP authorized solution (FedRAMP is the General Services Administration (GSA) program to certify cloud providers as being FISMA compliant), and industry is still some time away from being a listed FedRAMP Cloud Service Providers. In addition, the system will be part of a greater overall solution, so interoperability and connectivity between this system and the other systems would create additional complexity and IT architecture challenges such as creating new solutions to allow internal and external systems to transmit data. Finally, the Government anticipates the solution will require customization due to the unique, and non-standard, use of the solution to meet this effort's objectives and SaaS solutions are more limited in the amount of customization allowed. For the aforementioned the Government prefers a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product based model that can be maintained within DS's IT architecture as the best approach to meet this potential need.<br />Acronyms<br />CTO Chief Technology Officer<br />DS Diplomatic Security<br />DOS Department of State<br />FISMA Federal Information Security Management Act<br />HR Human Resources<br />NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology<br />OPM Office of Personnel Management<br />PSS Personnel Security and Suitability<br />SaaS Software as a Service<br />SI Security Infrastructure</p>

Sources Sought Synopsis

Project: OMB Circular A-123 Acquisition Assessment Services

Background: The Denver Acquisition and Logistics Center is conducting market research and seeking information from all interested vendors regarding performing OMB Circular A-123 Acquisition Assessment Services.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires acquisition assessment services to complete the requirements of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Management's Responsibility for Internal Control http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a123/a123_rev.html.

On May 21, 2008, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued a memorandum with guidelines for conducting entity level internal control reviews of the acquisition function as required by OMB Circular A-123.  Using tools similar to those for financial reporting, OFPP developed "Guidelines for Assessing the Acquisition Function", http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/procurement/memo/a123_guidelines.pdf , to provide the framework for standardizing the evaluation and reporting of entity level internal control reviews of the acquisition function.  This framework consists of four interrelated "cornerstones": (1) organizational alignment and leadership, (2) policies and processes, (3) human capital and     (4) information management and stewardship.  Each of these cornerstones directly influences the extent to which the acquisition function is efficient, effective, and accountable to the taxpayer.

VA requires the assessments at various VA locations across the continental United States.

Information Requested:  The Government is requesting that all interested vendors provide information regarding their experience and capability to perform these types of services.

The VA may utilize the responses to this Sources Sought to conduct additional market research. It is possible that the VA may invite respondents to attend an in-person question and answer meeting with VA officials. The information gathered will be used to more fully develop a requirement that would be properly completed.  Information obtained from this RFI and the subsequent meetings with the vendors, if any, may be utilized to assist the VA in developing a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quote (RFQ).

Vendors should also provide supporting documentation that describes past projects that are similar in scope.    

Specific Questions to be Addressed: All questions listed below must be answered completely.

1.	What is your organization's experience in performing acquisition assessment services?  It is especially important to include experience in assessing the federal agency acquisition functions under OMB Circular A-123.  Describe the scope of services and the agency(ies) for which these services were performed. Included names and telephone numbers of agency representatives with knowledge of the contract.  

2.	What is the socio-economic category of your company?

3.	Does your company have a GSA schedule contract that includes assessment services?


Responses: Responses should be single-spaced, 12 point-font, with numbered pages and should not exceed 20 pages in length, including cover page, appendices, tables and figures. Electronic submissions shall be in either Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format.  
Dates: Responses must be submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Denver Acquisition and Logistics Center, on or before 12PM (noon) Mountain Time on January 24, 2014.

Addresses: Please send to:  kip.sheppard@va.gov  

Note: The VA will utilize the information from this Sources Sought to help develop the agency's RFP or RFQ.  Vendors shall identify any proprietary information in their responses.  Proprietary materials will neither be distributed to nor discussed with any other vendor.  The use of information submitted to the Government as a result of this RFI will be at the discretion of the Government.  The information obtained from responses to this RFI will remain confidential insofar as permitted by law, including the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.

The Government is not obligated to provide comments to vendor submissions.  The Government will not pay for information solicited and will not recognize or reimburse any costs associated with any RFI submission.  Therefore, the Government recommends vendors submit electronic versions of, or web links to, previously prepared presentations, documentation, white papers, and other relevant information.

Disclaimer: Responses are not offers and cannot be accepted by VA to form a binding contract.  VA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought or to otherwise pay for information solicited. The term "vendor" refers to those members of industry providing a response to this Sources Sought.

Any questions should be electronically directed to Kip Sheppard, Contracting Officer, by 12 PM Mountain Time on January 17, 2014. E-mail communication must include company name, address, point of contract name and title, e-mail address, and phone number.

A.	General Information
BACKGROUND

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA) initiated the development and launch of a unique, engaging and immersive web based learning community titled MyVeHU Campus (MVC).  Launched in March of 2011, MVC serves to introduce and guide VA and VHA staff thru the many online resources available from past VHA eHealth University (VeHU) F2F conferences and provides an engaging, educational and accessible online learning resource.  VeHU is VHA's annual training conference that provides education on the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and related clinical software (VistA) developed by VHA. Every year, VeHU highlights innovations towards patient care through training classes on VHA's clinical informatics products.  

VHA OIA, has recognized the need for alternative means to traditional face-to-face (F2F) forums, meetings, and conferences.  VHA OIA has an on-going obligation to continue providing educational resources to our VHA Staff and clinical trainees and is focused on delivering alternative technologies such as the increased use of immersive on-line education virtual environments and webcasting. 

The following Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) shall provide VHA OIA and the MyVeHU Campus learning community with the necessary production and webcasting resources to expand its reach and deliver live, interactive and on-demand training and education to larger audiences in near real time, and at a greatly reduced cost.  MyVeHU Campus membership is currently at over 22,000 and will continue to grow in membership and value as VA's streaming initiatives expand.

It is the intent of VHA OIA to enter into aBPA with a selected and qualified small business vendor for the performance work identified herein.  In order to properly broadcast within MyVeHU Campus and grow attendance and exposure to VA staff, VHA OIA requires additional support services and intends to provide for those services utilizing this BPA.  Those services include speaker coach management, track directors, 508 compliance support, accreditation management/support, usability analysis, and outside speakers.  Actual performance will be ordered via specific event related task orders issued by a VHA OIA Contracting Officer. All orders under this BPA must be performed by the selected BPA Contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein, and in accordance with the requirements included in individual task orders issued under this BPA.

4.1	VIRTUAL EVENT SUPPORT TASK ORDERS

Many requirements are likely to be associated with virtual meetings conducted by the VHA OIA. These are typically 1-2 day meetings which are generally held to one originating location, but can also be held at various locations around the continental US. Due to the unique and immersive nature of these streaming events, many of these meetings will be held and/or originate from production facilities and studios and therefore are likely to be held in one location as a cost reduction measure. Participants for these virtual events may include senior management staff within Department of Veterans Affairs, VHA, OIA, EES and others as may be deemed necessary.   VHA OIA may conduct other types of virtual meetings and/or conferences at various locations with varying durations which will also require the services described herein. The number of expected on-line viewers/participants for virtual events (webcasts) may vary but are typically expected to be between 100 and 500 simultaneous users. The Contractor must accommodate these varying requirements and locations on an event by event basis as specified in individual task orders assigned to each event.

Accessibility Requirements (Section 508) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220) requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology (EIT), they must ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities.  Federal employees and members of the VA who have disabilities must have equal access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that enjoyed by non-disabled Federal employees and members of the VA. 

All EIT deliverables within this work statement shall comply with the applicable technical and functional performance criteria of Section 508 unless exempt. Specifically, the following applicable EIT accessibility standards have been identified: 

Section 508 Applicable EIT Accessibility Standards:  

o 	36 CFR 1194.22 Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications, applies to all Web-based deliverables, including documentation and reports procured or developed under this work statement. When any Web application uses a dynamic (non-static) interface, embeds custom user control(s), embeds video or multimedia, uses proprietary or technical approaches such as, but not limited to, Flash or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) then 1194.21 Software standards also apply to fulfill functional performance criteria.  

o 	36 CFR 1194.24 Video and Multimedia Products, applies to all video and multimedia products that are procured or developed under this work statement. Any video or multimedia presentation shall also comply with the software standards (1194.21) when the presentation is through the use of a Web or Software application interface having user controls available.  

o 	36 CFR 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria, applies to all EIT deliverables regardless of delivery method. All EIT deliverable shall use technical standards, regardless of technology, to fulfill the functional performance criteria. 

o 	36 CFR 1194.41 Information Documentation and Support, applies to all documents, reports, as well as help and support services. To ensure that documents and reports fulfill the required 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria, they shall comply with the technical standard associated with Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications at a minimum. In addition, any help or support provided in this work statement that offer telephone support, such as, but not limited to, a help desk shall have the ability to transmit and receive messages using TTY.  

Section 508 Applicable Exceptions.  Exceptions for this work statement have been determined by VA and only the exceptions described herein may be applied. Any request for additional exceptions shall be sent to the VHA OIA Project Coordinator and determination will be made in accordance with VA MD 4010.2. VA has identified the following exceptions that may apply:  

36 CFR 1194.3(b) Incidental to Contract, all EIT that is exclusively owned and used by the contractor to fulfill this work statement does not require compliance with Section 508. This exception does not apply to any EIT deliverable, service or item that will be used by any Federal employee(s) or member(s) of the VA. This exception only applies to those contractors assigned to fulfill the obligations of this work statement and for the purposes of this requirement, are not considered members of the VA.  

Section 508 Compliance Requirements 36 CFR 1194.2(b) (COTS/GOTS products), When procuring a product, each agency shall procure products which comply with the provisions in this part when such products are available in the commercial marketplace or when such products are developed in response to a Government solicitation. Agencies cannot claim a product as a whole is not commercially available because no product in the marketplace meets all the standards. If products are commercially available that meet some but not all of the standards, the agency must procure the product that best meets the standards. When applying this standard, all procurements of EIT shall have documentation of market research that identify a list of products or services that first meet the agency business needs, and from that list of products or services, an analysis that the selected product met more of the accessibility requirements than the non-selected products as required by FAR 39.2. Any selection of a product or service that meets less accessibility standards due to a significant difficulty or expense shall only be permitted under an undue burden claim and requires authorization from the VA.

<a href="mailto:matthew.a.chase.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Tobyhanna</a>
<DESC>Scope <br>  <br> The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit industry feedback regarding their capability to deliver special-purpose electrical connectors for cable manufacturing to support Product Manager Ground Soldier, Ft Belvoir, VA.  These connectors are part of Nett Warrior (NW), a weapon system that provides Battle Command and Situational Awareness to dismounted soldiers.  These connectors are also employed in US Army expeditionary power products used in the field.  The NW program established a technical architecture for interconnect cables based on earlier versions of the system, extensive qualification, field testing, trade-offs with multiple alternative sources and design iterations in earlier versions of the system.   <br>  <br> TYAD produces the interconnect cable assemblies for the NW Production and Fielding phase.  Glenair Inc. designed and manufactures a line of  quote mark Series 80 quote mark  electrical connectors that are a miniaturized version of MIL-DTL-38999 open standard connectors.  These push/pull connectors have been specified for use by the NW program.  Based on program requirements, all interface cable connectors shall be fully compatible with specific versions of Glenair 807 series connectors. <br>  <br> Information contained in this RFI is the result of preliminary research on existing depot connector resources, business intelligence capabilities, is subject to modification and is in no way binding on the Government. There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government contract. <br> Process <br>  <br> In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this RFI.  <br>  <br> This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be considered a proposal. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define requirements and compatible connectors to be considered. <br>  <br> If the Government develops a requirement that addresses any submitted or similar connectors, the resulting procurement will address technology and business requirements to achieve the required objectives.  Any results developed from this RFI may be the subject of a subsequent acquisition, and any such acquisition will be publicized accordingly.  Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving awards related to the submitted topic area.  <br>  <br> Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise because of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information. <br>  <br> All information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary, or represents confidential business information, will be received and held in confidence. Proprietary information submitted, as part of responses to the RFI, shall be clearly identified as COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE.  <br>  <br> TYAD reserves the right to follow up on a one-on-one basis with RFI respondents to gain additional information or clarity about information submitted by respondents, best practices, industry environment, and other subjects relevant to this RFI.  <br> Interested responders shall provide data and production representative connectors in a phased approach to determine interest and capability to provide source of supply for connector equivalents that are 100% compatible with Glenair part numbers:  <br>  <br> 	8070-1675-01ZNU6-6SY, Connector Receptacle, Crimp Socket <br> 	8070-1676-06ZNU6-6PY, Connector Plug, Crimp Pins. <br>  <br> Responses require engineering analysis, submission of drawings, providing test results, and supplying production representative sample connectors for the Government to assess compatibility with the benchmarks.  The Government will evaluate progress at the completion of each phase and determine if the candidate(s) sufficiently meet the criteria, before proceeding into subsequent efforts.  Detailed requirements on connector performance and test criteria are available on request. <br>  <br> Details <br>  <br> The Government will conduct a four phased technical assessment: <br>  	Identify candidates <br>  	Evaluate test results provided by industry <br>  	Manufacture sample cables for supplier testing <br>  	Conduct system testing by TYAD, and/or other Government agencies <br>  <br> Phase I--Identify Candidates <br>  <br> Interested suppliers shall submit technical details on candidate connectors to TYAD for technical evaluation.  This evaluation will assess the supplier's capacity to define the appropriate interfaces, dimensions, tolerances and materials in their candidate.  Suppliers shall provide drawings with sufficient information to perform an engineering assessment conducted by TYAD.  The Government will not assist industry in revising submissions or provide advice on developing a conforming product.  Successful candidates, as determined by the TYAD engineering analysis, will be invited to participate in Phase II. <br>  <br> Phase II--Manufacture sample connectors and test <br> Suppliers meeting the criteria in Phase I may continue into Phase II to produce 20 each of both types of connectors.  These connectors shall undergo testing by the supplier using certified equipment or by independent certified test facilities to validate conformance to a set of performance criteria provided by the Government.  Tests, as defined by TYAD, shall include mechanical and electrical compatibility with the benchmarks, as well as certain types of environmental testing tailored from MIL STD 810.  TYAD will evaluate test results documentation submitted by industry.  Failure to meet all requirements will be reason for dismissal of the applicant.  The Government will not assist industry in revising submissions or provide advice on developing a conforming product.  Successful candidates, as determined by TYAD, will be invited to participate in Phase III. <br>  <br> Phase III--Manufacture sample interconnects for subassembly testing <br> Suppliers that successfully complete Phase II will be invited to provide 20 each of both types of connectors and sufficient instructions for TYAD to produce cable assemblies with the candidate connectors.  The supplier may advise TYAD cable manufacturing on the assembly process to assure builds are complete as intended.  Process metrics will be collected to assist the Government in determining materials and labor content required to manufacture interconnect assemblies.  The Government may provide assembly details on interfacing the candidate connector the currently defined wire stock, cable shielding and overmolding.  Ten each of the resulting products will be returned to the supplier to conduct cable assembly testing to validate conformance to specifications and associated verification criteria.    Supplier testing shall use certified equipment or be conducted by independent certified test facilities.  Test data shall be submitted to TYAD for evaluation and candidates assessed as successful shall be further evaluated in Phase IV by TYAD. <br>  <br> Phase IV--System Testing <br> Suppliers who successfully complete Phase III will continue evaluation into Government testing.  TYAD will use the remaining 10 each cable assemblies to perform detailed testing on fully configured Nett Warrior systems to examine performance at the system level.  This step is necessary to assess aspects of connector-related system performance that cannot be evaluated at the component level.  A final evaluation will be conducted after completing testing and results will be provided to the Nett Warrior program office.  Individual respective assessments will be provided to each supplier participating in this phase. <br>  <br> Phase I is the initial focus of this RFI.   Interested participants shall provide technical information as described for Phase I, sufficient for TYAD to determine physical compatibility with the benchmarks.  Note any proprietary data as defined in the Process section of this RFI. <br>  <br> Send questions or concerns regarding this RFI through e-mail to:   <br>  <br> Stanley M Czock <br> Nett Warrior Systems Engineer <br> Tobyhanna Army Depot <br> Tobyhanna, Pa 18466 <br> stanley.m.czock.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br>  <br> Questions submitted prior to the closing date and answered by the Government will be published and available to parties registering interest in this RFI.  Complete responses to this RFI shall to be submitted electronically to the above referenced e-mail address, no later than 12:00 PM EST on 6 March 2014. Responses shall include the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with TYAD.  <br>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE<br /><br />National Institute of Standards and Technology<br /><br />Proposed Establishment of a Federally Funded Research and Development Center- Fourth Notice<br /><br />AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.<br /><br />ACTION: Special Notice.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Commerce, intends to sponsor a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) to support the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence's (NCCoE) mission to accelerate the widespread adoption of integrated cybersecurity tools and technologies.  NIST has posted three notices to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website advising the public of the agency's intention to sponsor an FFRDC to this point (Reference Numbers NCCoE_FFRDC-FRN_1: May 3, 2013; NCCoE_FFRDC-FRN_2: June 24, 2013; and NCCoE_FFRDC-FRN_3: July 18, 2013).  This is the fourth notice, the purpose of which is to provide responses to each comment received in response to the first three notices.  This notice accompanies Federal Register Notice 78 FR 1831 (January 10, 2014).<br /><br />FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:   Keith Bubar via email at Keith.Bubar@nist.gov or telephone 301.975.8329 or<br /><br />Keith Bubar<br />NIST<br />100 Bureau Drive Mail Stop 1640<br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640<br /><br />BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  NIST has identified the need to support the mission of the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) through the establishment of an FFRDC.  In evaluating the need for the FFRDC, NIST determined that no existing alternative sources can effectively meet the special needs of NIST.

<SUBJECT>--Intent to Issue a Sole Source Purchase Order to Oregon State University
<SOLNBR>SOL-DC-14-00013
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation's Climate Change Division intends to award a sole source purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Oregon State University to provide an update to EPA's current snowpack climate change indicator*, which is part of EPA's Climate Change Indicators Report.  The original analyses and data for EPA's existing snowpack indicator was obtained from Dr. Philip Mote (primary contact) based on published work of which he was the primary author.  Dr. Mote is currently the director of Oregon State University's Climate Change Research Institute.  Dr. Mote uniquely merged two distinct datasets together and developed the methodology for the trends analyses of snowpack measurement data (Mote et al. 2005).  The expertise held by Dr. Mote and the Climate Research Institute uniquely qualifies Oregon State University to perform the work in t he attached Statement of Work. EPA's indicators must be updated using the same methodologies and data sources for each indicator to ensure consistency of EPA's Climate Change Indicators Report.  Currently, the only way EPA can obtain the update to the current snowpack climate change indicator is by using the methodology developed by the lead author of the original analyses. 
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Jeffrey Martin, at martin.jeffrey@epa.gov. Please see the below attached Statement of Work describing the requirement.

<p>FAR Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999):</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection technique. Evaluation may be made with or without discussions with the Offeror(s). The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on an acceptable/unacceptable basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made based on the evaluation criteria listed in the attached evaluation criteria document and the PWS. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or a result of discussions will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following two (2) factors (See Attachment #3 - Evaluation Factors &amp; Subfactors):</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Capability<br />Factor 2. Price</p>
<p>Part I: Technical Capability (Do not exceed 20 pages. This includes the cover page, cover letter, and table of contents).</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability</p>
<p>Technical Capability Proposals will be given a rating of Acceptable or Unacceptable. A technically acceptable proposal shall have a sound technical approach that meets all Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements.</p>
<p>Determination Definition<br />ACCEPTABLE: ALL of the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal. The Offeror's proposal meets the performance and technical capability requirements defined in the PWS.<br /><br />UNACCEPTABLE: Not all of the minimum acceptable criteria are met by the proposal. An unacceptable proposal contains one or more deficiencies. The proposal fails to meet specified minimum performance and technical capability requirements defined in the PWS.</p>
<p><br />Proposal shall address the following subfactors as detailed in Attachment #3:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1: Training Requirements<br />Subfactor 2: Accreditation<br />Subfactor 3: Location</p>
<p><br />Part II: Pricing (Please include the cover page, cover letter, and table of contents that provides the curriculum of the course).</p>
<p>Factor 2: Price</p>
<p>The price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness based upon a comparison of the Offeror's price to the price of competitors. When two or more technically acceptable offers are received (competition) and the lowest price is selected, the price of the lowest offeror can be concluded to be fair and reasonable. A price that is very low will be verified to assure that the offeror understands what is being asked for and no mistakes have been made in preparing the price.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and FAR 15.403-3(a), information other than pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness or realism in the absence of competition. Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If after receipt of the proposals, the Contracting Officer determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the offeror shall be required to submit pricing data. The offeror is to complete the yellow highlighted areas for the costs of each CLIN within the Pricing Schedule (Attachment 4) and submit with the proposal, which will be evaluated for reasonableness. Do not make changes to the format of the Excel Spreadsheet in Attachment #4 without approval from the Contracting Officer. Proposed schedule is provided and is subject to change. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. Failure to provide prices as stated above may result in the rejection of the proposal. All pricing information shall be addressed ONLY in Pricing file format.</p>
<p>Technical Capability and Price are considered equal.</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<CONTACT>Scott P. Keasey, Phone 301-846-1115, Email scott.keasey@nih.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to support the development of a new model for computational analysis of biological data that has the potential to address the challenges described above. This model (which has been articulated recently in a series of NCI Precision Medicine Workshops and publications by experts in the field of biomedical informatics) involves the creation of a set of data repositories with co-located computational capacity and an Application Programming Interface (API) that provides security and data access for developers of analytic tools. In this model, applications are brought to the data, rather than bringing the data to the applications. Such a "Cancer Genomics Cloud" has the potential to democratize access to NCI-generated genomic data and provide a more cost-effective way to provide computational support to the cancer research community.
<p>Towards this end, the NCI seeks to sponsor the development of multiple Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots that will be available for use and testing by the scientific community as part of a competitive evaluation that will include technical benchmarking and cost analysis. If successful, the NCI will consult with the cancer research community and relevant oversight committee(s) to define, and potentially construct, a production version of one or more of the pilot clouds, or a successor design informed by the results of the pilot evaluations. In spirit, and by design, this new initiative will be the first step toward the establishment of a full Cancer Knowledge Commons, along the lines called for in the National Academy report on Precision Medicine, and will be coordinated with The National Institutes of Health's Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative and other relevant activities in large-scale data analysis.</p>
<p>No telephone inquiries will be accepted. All inquiries must be submitted in writing to <a href="mailto:ncicloud@mail.nih.gov">ncicloud@mail.nih.gov</a>. Any inquiries submitted after February 20, 2014 at 4:00 PM local time may not be reviewed.

<DESC>USAID anticipates awarding a cost reimbursement completion-type contract as a result of this solicitation, covering an estimated period of four (4) years, subject to availability of funds and satisfactory performance. The estimated cost range for this procurement is of $23.5 million to $24.5million.
<p>The goal of this project is for the agricultural value chain(s) to increase productivity and output, increase nutritious foods available to agricultural producers, increase employment in the agricultural sector, and increase the market share of crops in the value chains(s) in both domestic and foreign markets.</p>
<p>Kyrgyz Republic is part of the US government's Feed the Future initiative.  Though not a focus country, USAID's work in Kyrgyz Republic contributes to the initiative's high-level goals of reducing poverty and stunting, and the agency's work is guided by Feed the Future operational principles.</p>
<p>The zone of influence for this project - and thus the area of geographic focus - is defined as the entirety of Naryn, Jalalabad, Osh, and Batken Oblasts. While this project will focus on a particular geographic area, work with value-chain actors in other areas may be warranted, particularly if it has relevance to the zone of influence.</p>
<p>Priority will be given to developing value chains that directly involve smallholder farmers in the zone of influence and/or expand their access to markets.</p>

<DESC>U.S.  Department of Transportation<br />Research Innovative and Technology Administration (RITA) <br />Research, Development and Technology Office, RDT-50<br />1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE <br />Washington, DC  20590
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION:</strong> Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), being issued on behalf of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is soliciting Full Proposals for activities to validate initiatives in support of the U.S. DOT Commercial Remote Sensing and Spatial Information (CRS&amp;SI) technologies program for transportation infrastructure development and construction.  <strong>AT THE LEVEL OF THE PRIME OFFEROR (APPLICANT), COMPETITION IS RESTRICTED TO UNIVERSITIES.</strong> Proposed SUB-Recipients may, however, be ANY kind of organization or individual, commercial or otherwise. Interested and eligible offerors may submit separate Full Proposals on one or more of the focus areas described in this announcement.  Full Proposal on each focus area will be divided into detailed technical and cost proposals and must follow the attached guidelines for preparing and submitting the proposal documents. Separate Full Proposals must be submitted for each proposed project/focus area and multiple projects/initiatives cannot be combined into a single Full Proposal.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE:</strong> The CRS&amp;SI technologies program is authorized in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) (PL 109-59) &sect; 5506. The U.S. DOT RITA manages the CRS&amp;SI technologies program.  <strong>RITA INTENDS TO AWARD MULTIPLE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS FROM THIS BAA.  THE TOTAL AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR THIS PHASE IS APPROXIMATELY $6.3 MILLION. ALL AWARDS MADE ARE SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF PROGRAM FUNDS. FEDERAL SHARE REQUESTS IN FULL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION MAY NOT EXCEED $700,000.</strong></p>
<p>This SAFETEA-LU program focuses on major national initiatives and validation of CRS&amp;SI technology applications which deliver smarter and more efficient methods, processes and services for transportation infrastructure development and construction. The program awards will be competitively selected from individual/consortia teams of university research entities working in partnership with industry and state agencies, and meeting the technical and cost sharing requirements of this announcement.</p>
<p>COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING includes remotely sensed imageries and data from satellites, aerial platforms, manned and unmanned vehicles and related Intelligent Transportation Systems and services. SPATIAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY include Position and Navigation data from Global Positioning systems (GPS), Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) etc. The proposals should focus on CRS&amp;SI technology products applicable to transportation infrastructure development and construction.</p>
<p>These focus areas are chosen based on DOT priorities for CRS&amp;SI technology applications for user services that have the potential to produce a high return on investment, in terms of saving costs and improving the efficiency and practices of infrastructure development, planning, construction and condition assessment procedures. Therefore, in order to ensure safe and efficient movement of people and freight within the national transportation infrastructure system, this program is soliciting projects dedicated to reduce inefficiencies, improve system performance, and assess infrastructure condition through implementation of applied research.  Specific <strong>FOCUS AREAS</strong> include:</p>
<p>&bull;	<em>RISK ASSESSMENT &amp; EVALUATION: NETWORK LEVEL RISK ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION OF TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH NATURAL CALAMITIES SUCH AS FLOODS, STORMS, HURRICANES, EARTH QUAKES ETC.;<br /><br />&bull;	POST-HAZARD RESPONSE: NETWORK LEVEL INSPECTION AND EVALUATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR BRIDGES, LARGE CULVERTS, TUNNELS, SIGN STRUCTURES, ETC. THAT PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE DATA FOR PLANNING, MAINTENANCE, AND MANAGEMENT;<br /><br />&bull;	PLANNING, OPERATIONS, MAINTENANCE &amp; PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT: INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS TO INCLUDE WATERWAYS, HIGHWAY FACILITIES, FREIGHT, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND RAILROADS; AND<br /><br />&bull;	SYSTEM DEFICIENCY DETECTION &amp; DAMAGE PREVENTION.</em></p>
<p>The proposed approach addressing any of the above focus areas must pursue ALL OF the following objectives:</p>
<p>1.	Apply and validate CRS&amp;SI technologies to collect data and provide a framework for analysis in studies and projects related to infrastructure development design, planning and construction;</p>
<p>2.	Apply advances in spatial-based technology applications to increase efficiency and safety, reduce congestion and shorten the time required to develop multimodal transportation options;</p>
<p>3.	Apply concepts of CRS&amp;SI technology integration and products to monitor the condition of constructed infrastructure systems and provide quantitative data to reduce/supplement components of current visual inspection procedures;</p>
<p>4.	Develop and apply decision support systems using CRS&amp;SI data and visualization techniques to effectively monitor/assess the condition of new/existing infrastructure systems;</p>
<p>5.	Develop tools/products and effectively disseminate the results to relevant transportation user-communities such as academia, private sector and public sector agencies; and</p>
<p>6.	Develop and execute a comprehensive project outreach program to effectively inform and disseminate project results and products to relevant transportation user-communities such as academia, private sector and public sector agencies;</p>
<p><br /><strong>FULL PROPOSAL, EVALUATION AND AWARD SELECTION:</strong> RITA is soliciting detailed technical and cost proposals that address focus areas outlined in this announcement (see above).  A proposal must include a cost sharing contribution of at least half (50%), in accordance with SAFETEA-LU Section 5101 (a)(1) and (b), of the proposed project's cost to be considered.  In other words, the grand total dollar amount of an Applicant's proposed <strong>COST-SHARING</strong> contribution to the project must <strong>BE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN</strong> the total dollar amount of the <strong>FEDERAL</strong> funding sought by the Applicant. Cost sharing may include direct, indirect and in-kind cost contributions and can be made collectively from the consortia of university research centers, industry and state agencies. Proposed partnerships and cost-sharing arrangements will need to be presented in detail for all Full Proposals.

<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (JOTFOC)<br />1. Agency and Contracting Activity: <br />U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN), 4000 Coast Guard Blvd, Portsmouth, VA 23703</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: <br />Procurement of Brand Specific and model specific VHF communications equipment for Vessel Traffic Service Houston - Galveston.</p>
<p>3. Description of supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value): <br />The proposed acquisition consists of the following:</p>
<p>Zetron Four Position Bundled 4048 RD/M4217, 14-Channels Positions: (4) Integrator RD Clients / M4217s and PC Workstations Common Control Equipment: (2) M4048 PSUs, (1) M4048 Console Card Cage, (1) M4048Channel Card Cage Cards: (2) System Traffic Cards, (4) Console Interface Cards (7) Dual Channel Tone/Local T/R Control Cards, Part Number: 905-0310</p>
<p>Zetron Integrator IRR Package (license required see 930-0048 below). Includes Integrator IRR CDROM and radio/telephone interface. Speakers not included, Part Number: 930-0247</p>
<p>Zetron Integrator IRR Full Protection License, Part Number: 930-0048</p>
<p>Zetron IRR Multi-media Desktop PC Speakers, Part Number: 802-5006</p>
<p>Zetron 5.25" CRT Base Mounts a M4217 and is deep enough to stand a monitor on, Part Number 400-0205</p>
<p>Estimated Value: $95,000.00</p>
<p>4. An Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than Full and Open Competition: <br />The statutory authority permitting other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." And 6.302-1(c) Application of Brand Named Description. Zetron is the Specific Brand required, and Zetron Inc is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).</p>
<p>5. A Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br />The USCG is required to provide radio services to mariners in the VTS Houston-Galveston area. A Zetron system is currently deployed to meet this need. The system consists of deployed radio transceivers, a core unit located at the Sector and networking between the transceivers and the Sector.</p>
<p>The office is relocating. During the relocation radio services must be continuously available; no down time. This procurement acquires a separate core system to be installed at the new location. During the transition, the core system at the old location and the new location will both be able to utilize the deployed transceivers via the existing network. Both locations accessing the transceivers will allow the continuous availability of VTS radio services.</p>
<p>6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies: <br />A Brand Specific RFQ will be posted to the Government Point of Entry (GPE) FedBizOps with the statement, "Any Authorized Distributor that feels that they can provide the items exactly as stated may provide Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Cost Quotation in reply to this posting. "</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable: <br />Fair and Reasonable will be determined with the comparison of past purchases of Zetron items.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted: <br />A search of the items was conducted using the Internet. A listing of authorized Zetron distributors was located. Market Research showed Zetron Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer. This FBO RFQ is for 5 of the Items required, Market Research showed the other 13 required items listed on the Procurement Request were available via GSA, and a GSA RFQ has been posted via GSA E-buy for those 13 items.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: <br />This procurement is to buy a component which will interface with the existing system. This same Zetron system has been deployed as a standard configuration item throughout the Vessel Traffic Centers (VTC) in the USCG. Reengineering the Vessel Traffic System to include new communication controllers would involve considerable rework and expense: the purchase of spares for the depot, and retraining of maintenance personnel would cost will be over $150,000.00 at each VTC Locations.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: <br />No other interest has been expressed.</p>
<p>11. Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for supplies or services required: <br />None at this time.</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification: <br />I certify that this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.<br />James A. Lassiter<br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p>13. Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel.<br />I certify this procurement meets the Governments minimum need and the supporting data which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief<br />LT Art Plummer<br />Technical Representative</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. 
If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security

<p>(5)  MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT <br />1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract.  In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession.  This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items.   These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed.</p>
<p>2.  The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated.  Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc.  The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document".  A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator.  The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award.  The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified.  Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report".   This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times.  All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report.  At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed.  A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness.  The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract.   This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice.  Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received.  A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /> <br />4.  Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard.  This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(6)  GROWTH WORK<br />(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization.  Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government.  If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a <br />Time and Materials modification for this specific repair.  In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.  <br />(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification.  Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an MLCA 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed.  Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown.  If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.<br />(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation.  The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade.  Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor.  Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer.  Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(7)  COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: <br />The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work.  The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.<br />(a)	The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br /> (1)	direct labor wages and salaries;<br /> (2)	all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br /> (3)	other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br /> (4)	all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br /> (5)	any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br /> (6)	profit (fee); and<br /> (7)	all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br /> Supervision and Management   Planning and Estimating<br /> Material Handling            Housekeeping<br /> Engineering                  Transportation/Drivers<br /> Quality Assurance            Contract Administration<br /> Security                     Testing</p>
<p>(b)	The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only.  Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above.  This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system.  These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c)	The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation.  The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract.  The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract.  The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

The purpose of the following amendment is to:
Extends the response date from 01/10/2014 to 01/17/2014.

Answer questions submitted by prospective vendors (see below).

CONSOLIDATED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (1/13/14)
Solicitation # VA248-14-Q-0337

QUESTIONS: All questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted to the Contracting Specialist in writing (email is acceptable).  Any prospective bidder desiring an explanation or interpretation of the solicitation must request it in writing to the Contracting Officer:  Christopher Brailer (christopher.brailer@va.gov)  No Later Than: close of business on January 9, 2014.  No phone responses will be accepted.  See FAR 52.214-6 Explanation to Prospective Bidders for additional information.

Q: Where is the location for delivery?
A: Malcom Randall VA Medical Center
    1601 SW Archer Road, Gainesville, FL 32608
Q: Do you need the quote FOB destination?
A: FOB Destination.
Q: DO you have a model number for this motor?
A: The SPEC# of the current motors is SPEC #: BAL18E577X765. There is no catalogue number.
Q: Is the customer going to use 230 or 460 volts?
A: 460 Volts.



Q: What is the turn-down ratio of the motor?
A: Per the response from the customer, "These motors are currently on VFD's. They have to be inverter duty motors. The original problem is that when they installed the plant, the Chilled Water Pumps were put on VFD's (Variable Frequency Drive) without being rated as inverter duty motors. We are working to correct this. The impellers were not shaved down as far as I know, because the pumps were going to be run with VFD's. We need premium efficiency inverter duty motors to replace the old motors."
The customer is under the impression that what they need does not have a turn-down ratio. If there is one associated with an inverter duty rated motor, he does not know what it would be.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Air Force (USAF) Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA) at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio, is announcing its intent to solicit proposals under Request For Proposal (RFP) FA8056-14-R-0001. This solicitation will serve to acquire Roof Replacement and Repair for all Active Duty USAF Installations within the Contiguous United States (CONUS), including facilities managed under Joint Basing agreements where the USAF is the lead agent.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this solicitation is 238160, Roofing Contractors. The business size standard in dollars is $14M.</p>
<p>This acquisition is a total small business set-aside with awards carved out for 8(a) firms. The Government anticipates awarding Regional Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. These regions include the following facilities, which may include various ranges.</p>
<p>West: <br />California (Beale AFB, Edwards AFB, Los Angeles AFB, Travis AFB, Vandenberg AFB), Colorado (Buckley AFB, Cheyenne Mountain AFS, Peterson AFB, Schriever AFB, United States Air Force Academy), Idaho (Mountain Home AFB), Montana (Malmstrom AFB), Nevada (Creech AFB, Nellis AFB, Tonopah Test Range), Utah (Hill AFB &amp; Test Ranges), Washington (Fairchild AFB), and Wyoming (F.E. Warren AFB).</p>
<p>Midwest: <br />Illinois (Scott AFB), Kansas (McConnell AFB), Missouri (Whiteman AFB), Nebraska (Offutt AFB), North Dakota (Cavalier AFS, Grand Forks AFB, and Minot AFB), and South Dakota (Ellsworth AFB).</p>
<p>Northeast: <br />Delaware (Dover AFB), Maryland (Joint Base Andrews), Massachusetts (Cape Cod AFS and Hanscom AFB), New Hampshire, (New Boston AFS), New Jersey (Joint Base McGuire), New York (Rome Labs), Ohio (Wright-Patterson AFB), and Virginia (Joint Base Langley).</p>
<p>Southwest: <br />Arizona (Davis-Monthan AFB, Luke AFB &amp; Ranges), New Mexico (Cannon AFB, Holloman AFB and Kirtland AFB), Oklahoma (Altus AFB, Tinker AFB and Vance AFB), and Texas (Dyess AFB, Goodfellow AFB, Joint Base San Antonio (includes Lackland AFB, Randolph AFB and Fort Sam Houston) Laughlin AFB and Sheppard AFB).</p>
<p>Southeast: <br />Alabama (Maxwell-Gunter AFB), Arkansas (Little Rock AFB), Florida (Avon Park AFR, Cape Canaveral AFS, Eglin AFB, Hurlburt AFB, MacDill AFB, Patrick AFB, and Tyndall AFB), Georgia (Moody AFB and Robins AFB), Louisiana (Barksdale AFB), Mississippi (Columbus AFB and Kessler AFB), North Carolina (Seymour-Johnson AFB), South Carolina (Joint Base Charleston and Shaw AFB &amp; Ranges) and Tennessee (Arnold AFB).</p>
<p>Offerors may propose and win IDIQ Contracts in a maximum of two (2) regions, and should expect to submit separate, complete proposals for each region. The contract awards will be for one (1) base year and up to four (4) option years.</p>
<p>The USAF intends to award a target of thirty-two (32) multiple-award IDIQ contracts which will be divided between the five (5) geographic regions. The total contract value is approximately $220M with a ceiling of approximately $325M. Twenty four (24) contractors will receive Effective Awards and be immediately available to compete for task orders. A target of eight (8) additional contractors will receive On-Ramp Awards and be eligible to compete for task orders if the USAF determines that additional capacity is needed in any of the five geographic regions.</p>
<p>Please note that there have been several changes since the Draft RFP release in April 2013. These changes include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Removed requirement for state licensing as part of the technical proposal since not all U.S. states levy this requirement<br />&bull; Removed requirement for the 5 year bonded general contractor construction warranty for roof replacement projects<br />&bull; Added a Contractor Data Requirements List (CDRL) item for annual reporting<br />&bull; Deleted the Technical_Proposal_Narrative_Attachment.docx to simplify proposal submittals<br />&bull; Added contract clauses to allow bases to further set-aside task order projects</p>
<p>All potential offerors should carefully review the instructions in Section L as well as the evaluation criteria described in Section M of the Solicitation. AFICA will award contracts in accordance with the evaluation procedures established in the Final RFP. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.</p>
<p>The USAF is not responsible for notifying any interested parties of the solicitation beyond this notice. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the official government point of entry, www.fbo.gov, for further updates and instructions.</p>

A subsequent pre-proposal conference will be held after the release of the solicitation.
<p>The goal for the Basic Handheld RIID Industry Day event is to provide industry with information relevant to the  upcoming solicitation, including:</p>
<p>&bull;	An overview of the Basic Handheld RIID requirement, including draft requirements for a Basic Handheld RIID. <br />&bull;	An overview of intended concepts of operation by potential end users.</p>
<p>The registration form for the event is enclosed. The list of Basic Handheld RIID draft requirements to be discussed during the event will be issued one week prior to the event.  All releasable information provided during the Basic Handheld RIID Industry Day will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website after the event. Attendance at Industry Day is not mandatory for participation in a future competition for this requirement.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION<br />Registration will be conducted in advance and is open to all interested parties. This is an UNCLASSIFIED event; security clearance visit requests are not required.</p>

This security requirement will be strictly followed and late &lsquo;Incoming Foreign National Visitor' forms and/or walk-ins will not be permitted.   Non-US citizens who have not been previously vetted by DNDO may not attend this Industry Day, but may submit the enclosed &lsquo;Incoming Foreign National Visitors' form to attend future DNDO events.  If you are uncertain of your vetting status, please email DNDO.HPRDS@hq.dhs.gov.</p>
<p>Registration forms must be fully completed and emailed to DNDOHPRDS@hq.dhs.gov by 5:30 pm Eastern Time on January 7, 2014. Late registrations and "walk-in" requests will not be permitted.

All responses must be unclassified. This is a no-fee event, and due to space constraints seating is limited to a maximum of five (5) participants per company.</p>
<p>Event check-in will open at 0830 and the session will begin promptly at 1000. Attendees are encouraged to arrive early to permit time for the check-in process.</p>
<p>&bull; Attendees must present a current photo identification matching the attendee's information submitted via the registration form to gain entry into the event.</p>

This RFI is issued for the purpose of understanding the range of services available for transforming PowerBuilder software to a JAVA code base in support of transitioning Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS) to an Open Architecture (OA) web-based and/or Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) based Automated Information System to replace the current client server based NTCSS.  NTCSS provides the unit commanding officer of ships, submarines, aviation squadrons, and intermediate maintenance (afloat and ashore) activities the ability to manage: ship/aircraft maintenance, parts inventory, finances, tech manuals and drawings, and personnel nformation. In order for NTCSS to meet future Navy and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements, NTCSS must transition from a client-server architecture to a modern and sustainable Open Architecture (OA). OA in this context can include web-based and/or SOA based application functionality. The current In-Service NTCSS system continues to incur increased maintenance and operational risk due to information assurance  vulnerabilities with an aging baseline as well as expanding technology gaps with modern OA based systems. Transitioning to an OA environment will allow for better utilization of resources and improve reliability, reusability, and reduce overall total ownership cost.  Responses are requested no later than 13 January 2014 at 13:00 PDT.

Posted 9/26/2013:
The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N66001-14-R-0028 for Unmanned Maritime Systems Support. SSC Pacific Maritime Systems Division (Code 56400) has been tasked to manage the deployment and operation of unmanned maritime systems, and to contract for engineering and technical services in support of these systems.  These services are required to support the emergent Office of the Secretary of Defense requirement for deployment of prototype and operational systems used in defense against an array of underwater threats, including mines and improvised explosive devices, to several geographic Areas of Responsibility.  To meet overall mission responsibilities, service support is required for these capabilities in the areas of: studies and analysis; requirements, specifications, and design; fabrication, development, integration, assembly, and installation; test and evaluation; fielding and operations; depot maintenance support; training; logistics; and documentation, administration, configuration management, and program management.
This acquisition is a follow-on procurement to N66001-09-D-0032, which was awarded to EDO Professional Services on 22 July 2009.
Acquisition planning began in January 2013.  A market survey to determine small business capability was posted on SPAWAR E-Commerce Central on 24 January 2013.  After thorough review of the small business respondents' capabilities, SSC Pacific intends to solicit the requirement using full and open competition.
Multiple awards are anticipated.  This proposed contract has security requirements at the Secret level. The anticipated contract type will be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity with a three-year base period and two one-year option periods. Subsequent Task Orders will be issued for individual efforts. The estimated level of effort, based upon Full Time Equivalents (FTE's), will be approximately 175 per year. Each FTE is estimated to be 2,080 hours per year. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 and the Small Business Size Standard is $35.5M. The estimated value of the acquisition is $245M.
Draft and final RFPs will only be available electronically. Electronic copies of the RFP may be obtained from the SPAWAR E-Commerce website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil under SSC Pacific "Open Solicitations".  Hard copy versions of the RFP and any subsequent amendments will not be available. Firms are encouraged to review the website regularly for important solicitation information.

<DESC>The proposed projects are for Maintenance Dredging of Newark Bay, NJ, Federal Navigation Project. <br /><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT TO BE USED FOR MARKET ANALYSIS ONLY. NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE FROM THE RESPONSES TO THIS SYNOPSIS. NO SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL QUALIFIED CONCERNS DOING WORK UNDER NAICS 237990. ANY POTENTIAL COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION(S) THAT MAY PROCEED FROM THIS NOTICE WILL BE POSTED TO FEDBIZOPPS. ALL INTERESTED OFFERORS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AT A LATER TIME IF AND WHEN A SOLICITATION IS ISSUED. <br /><br />The purpose of this announcement is to gain knowledge of potential business sources; with specific interest in small business, certified 8(a) Small Business firms serviced by SBA districts located within New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, certified HUB Zone Small Business firms, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business firms (SDVOSB. No awards will be made from the responses to this Market Survey. <br />Background Information <br /><br />The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) proposes to perform maintenance dredging of portions of the Newark Bay, New Jersey, Federal Navigation Project. The proposed maintenance dredging would involve the removal of approximately 366,500 cubic yards (approximately 201,000 cubic yards as basic work, and the remaining as options) of selected critical shoals from Port Newark and Port Newark Pierhead Channels to a depth of -40 feet Mean Low Water (MLW) plus one (1) foot allowable overdepth, subject to the availability of funds. The dredged material, consisting primarily of silt and clay, must subsequently be placed at a suitable contractor-furnished, state-permitted upland placement site(s). It is anticipated that prior to final placement, it will be required to first process the maintenance material at a dredged material processing facility. <br /><br />The apparent low bidder shall, within 35 calendar days from the date the apparent low bidder is notified of being such, provide copies of all required permits and approvals for transfer, transportation, dewatering and / or other processing, and final disposal of dredged material, and shall submit evidence of such permits and approvals to the Government. <br /><br />Once the contract is awarded, the contractor will be required to maintain an integrated production rate of at least 2,250 cubic yards per calendar day for the dredging, transfer, transportation, dewatering and / or other processing, and final disposal of the material. The presence of dredging equipment in the channel will impact ship traffic, and it is necessary to maintain this production rate while minimizing the duration of this impact. <br /><br />Due to restrictions expected to be found in the water quality certificate, it is likely that the proposed work must / can only be performed by a mechanical dredge with a closed environmental clamshell bucket. Additionally, multiple barges and tug boats will be needed to perform the work during the dredging, dewatering and unloading operations. The dredged material will be required to meet all federal, state and local criteria required by the government agencies having jurisdiction where the placement site is located. All necessary permits required for the dredged material placement will be provided to the Government. <br /><br />The proposed work is anticipated to take place between April and July 2014. <br />SURVEY OF THE DREDGING INDUSTRY <br /><br />The following is a confidential survey questionnaire designed to apprise the Corps of prospective dredging contractors' project execution capabilities. Please provide your response to the following questions. All questions are in regard to the Newark Bay maintenance dredging project. <br /><br />General <br /><br />1) Have you ever worked on dredging jobs similar in nature to this project? If so, please describe the project and for whom the work was performed. Identify a point of contact and phone number, if possible. <br /><br />2) What percentage of work (volume of material dredged, transported, dewatered processed, and ultimately placed) can you perform with your own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern? <br /><br />3) Have you performed dredging within the waters of the Port of New York and New Jersey? <br /><br />4) Would you be willing to bid on the project previously described? If the answer is No, please explain why not? <br /><br />5) Would you be bidding on this project as a sole contractor, prime contractor with subcontractor(s) or as a joint venture? <br /><br />6) Is there a dollar limit on the size contract that you would bid? <br /><br />7) What is the largest dredging contract, in dollars, on which you were the prime contractor? <br /><br />8) What is your bonding capacity per contract?

<DESC><p>The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) is a part of the National Security Investigations Division and acts as a bridge for government organizations that have an interest in information on nonimmigrants whose primary reason for coming to the United States is to be students. On behalf of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), SEVP manages schools, nonimmigrant students in the F and M visa classifications and their dependents. The Department of State (DoS) manages Exchange Visitor Programs, nonimmigrant exchange visitors in the J visa classification and their dependents. Both SEVP and DoS use the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.</p>
<p>SEVIS, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, is the Internet-based system where DHS maintains information on SEVP-certified schools, as well as the international students who come to the United States to study in F or M status and attend those schools. SEVIS also maintains information on DoS-designated visitor program sponsors and J-1 visa exchange visitor program participants.</p>
<p>This award represents a bridge task order for SEVIS Help Desk Tier 1 &amp; 2 Support Services.</p>
