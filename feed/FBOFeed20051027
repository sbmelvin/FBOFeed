<DESC>APPLICATION SUPPORT CENTERS (ASC) Operations and Facilities Services – The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (DHS/USCIS) has a requirement to operate, lease, and maintain facilities for the Application Support Center Program.  Requirements include biometrics collection, mobile route operations, application collection, local scheduling, facilities leasing/ maintenance, special projects, and project/administrative support to process USCIS customers seeking immigration benefits.  Currently, biometrics capture and other services for approximately 3.5 million applicants (5 million processed benefits) are performed annually by approximately 1,300 contractor staff at 136 government or contractor-leased ASCs through the USA and its territories.  The prime vendor must assume all leases for contractor-leased space (currently 81 leases), and may be required to obtain leases for and operate a new domestic scheduling center and potentially overseas sites.  DHS anticipates significant ASC organizational and process changes during the life of the contract to meet future workload and homeland security issues.  Sites may be added, moved, or deleted as needs change.  Significant workload lulls and surges are expected.  All contractor staff must be U.S. citizens and must be able to obtain a T-2 (mid-risk) or T-1 (high-Risk) clearance.  Labor categories will vary by site and may consist of site supervisors, quality assurance specialists, quality assurance processors, biometrics technicians, unarmed guards, armed guards, schedulers, and other labor categories that cover the work listed above.

The Power Sources Team of the Logistics Readiness Center (LRC), US Army Communications Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) is in the process of forming a new spec ification for military non-rechargeable lithium batteries intended for portable communications electronics equipment. MIL-PRF-49471B and its associated specification sheets describe the current battery configurations that the batteries of the new specifica tion will replace. Be aware that the current descriptions of these batteries will be somewhat different in the new specification. One major difference will be the incorporation of both State of Charge Indicator (SOCI) and System Management Bus (SMBus) data  output in many of the batteries. The new specification is intended to include a qualification requirement. Qualification is planned for two families of batteries: 14 lithium manganese dioxide batteries and 2 lithium sulfur dioxide batteries. The goal is t o establish a Qualified Product List (QPL) for all these batteries. As part of the process, we need to know which producers would have an interest in participating in the qualification program should we be authorized to conduct it. We need notice of such i nterest prior to applying for authorization. Those sources that provide us with a notice of intent to participate will be involved in the review process for the specification. Each source may decide at any point to withdraw from participation. Should we be  authorized to conduct the program, an announcement seeking applicants for qualification will be issued once the specification is final. It is requested that those sources that wish to participate in the qualification program for military non-rechargeable lithium batteries provide within two weeks of the date of this notice, a written notification of their intent to participate to:   Patrick Lyman, Quality Assurance Specialist, US Army C-E LCMC LRC Power Sources Team, (732) 532-8824, DSN 992-8824, and e-mail address Patrick.Lyman@us.army.mil.

This sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Additionally, FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii) supports the use of “Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements,” because this acquisition is also considered to be a follow-on contract for the provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that an award to any other source would result in (1) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and/or (2) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.

Evaluation of the contractor's unique capability, experience and access to proprietary data for the Tracer ES&T Model 2600 TGA concluded that the requirement described above is available from only one source.  An indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract is contemplated for the issuance of firm-fixed price task orders during a five-year period beginning in early CY 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>A. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Space Based Infrared Technology Branch (AFRL/VSSS), at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors for the Imaging Spectrometer Focal Plane Array (ISFPA) program. The intent of this program is to posture the DOD for current and future-generation hyperspectral sensing applications by developing a single, multipurpose, high performance, large format array that operates simultaneously in the Visible and Short Wavelength Infrared (VIS-SWIR).  The Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) sensor unique concept has been structured to address constraints and complexities imposed by current generation Sensor Chip Assembly (SCA) technology.  The Government anticipates that the combined value of Task 1, 2, and 3, with the potential for multiple awards, will be between $3 and $6 Million and will be accomplished within a two year time frame.  The ceiling for the entire effort, all tasks and including multiple awards is estimated at $9.7 Million.  The driving goal for this program is to deliver initial “flight-grade” arrays for insertion into a demonstration system within two years from contract award.  AFRL/VSSS is pursuing a 4-phase (via task orders) approach to the delivery of the ISFPAs from concept to development of engineering and “flight-grade” demonstration arrays:  Task 1 will comprise the preliminary design addressing HSI unique priorities.  Task 2 will be the development to the Critical Design Review (CDR).  Task 3 will be the fabrication of two (2) engineering and two (2) “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs.  Task 4 will consist of the production of additional “flight-grade” SCAs. 
B. Current technology shortfalls limit air-borne and space-borne tactical system design options, impose collection and post-collection processing complexities, and limit achievable performance metrics.  System designers must accept reduced swath widths or sizeable dead zones associated with butting arrays or implement complex pointing maneuvers to achieve coverage requirements.  Coupled with the desire for large-format arrays is the need to successfully operate over a wide dynamic range.  The dynamic range constraints could be partially addressed by providing a wide range of variable frame times as well as by recognizing that scene irradiance varies significantly over the spectral band opening the door to variable conversion gains across the spectral dimension of the SCA.  High pixel operability is yet another critical parameter.  Therefore, in summary, the Government has identified four (4) critical technology advances for this program: (1) the hybridization of high-yield, large format arrays with minimal dead zones, (2) the development of next generation read out integrated circuit (ROIC) designs compatible with large format arrays incorporating on-chip  Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC), (3) ROIC designs for high frame rate conditions and high linearity over a large dynamic range, and (4) the development of high-performance, VIS-SWIR SCAs addressing operational and storage-life constraints.  Desired features of this SCA include operation in the visible through short-wave infrared spectral bands, programmable frame time, programmable conversion gain, large format, and on-chip ADC.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to contact the technical POC to verify interest in the effort to be proposed as well as to obtain the program specific goals (provided in a separate document).  The contractor will investigate methodologies, which include designing and/or processing of detector arrays and ROICs to improve performance and radiation tolerance based on the goals provided.  A minimum of two (2) flight-grade and two (2) engineering-grade SCAs are expected as deliverables to AFRL as a result of this program.  This program may include delivery of additional SCA deliverables (this is a potential task order number 4).

C. This acquisition is anticipated to result in multiple awards using Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts consisting of tasks for preliminary design (Task 1), detailed critical design (Task 2), fabrications of engineering and “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs (Task 3), and possibly additional “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs as a potential task order number 4.  Up to three (3) contract awards may be made depending on the quality of the proposals received and funds available.

Task 1: The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee Contract for Task 1.  Task 1 will be issued concurrent with the contract award and will constitute the contract’s guaranteed minimum order requirement.  Task 1 is anticipated to be a four (4) month effort to accomplish the preliminary design of the technical goals.  Initial proposals shall include substantiation of specialized experience.  The exit criteria for this task will include providing supporting evidence that overall program cost, schedule and risk are at an acceptable level to proceed into further levels of development.  Risk mitigation factors for successfully accomplishing Task 3 must also be addressed.

Task 2 is anticipated to develop the detailed design of the VIS-SWIR ISFPA.  The overall goal of this task will be to mature the design to the critical design level addressing the technical goals of the program. Again the exit criteria for this task will include providing supporting evidence that program cost, schedule, and risk are at an acceptable level to proceed into fabrication, demonstration, and test.  Risk mitigation factors for successfully accomplishing Task 3 must also be addressed.

Task 3 is anticipated to address the fabrication and testing of ISFPAs.  The overall goal of this task will be to fabricate two (2) engineering SCAs and two (2) demonstration SCAs.  

Task 4 is anticipated to fabricate additional “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs.

D. A separate in-depth description of the goals of this effort is available upon request.  Because of ITAR requirements, all requests for goals must be accompanied by a copy of the DD 2345 or JCP confirmation number.  The goals will then be sent to the address of record on the DD 2345.  Design parameter goals have been categorized as A, B, or C priorities based upon relative importance to Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) sensor goals and objectives.  Category A parameters represents the highest priority.  Categories B and C may be traded for lower risk, cost, and/or improved performance.  Offerors should review and respond to all of the goals, with greater emphasis given to the higher priority items. Offerors should structure their program such that risks of attaining the goals are minimized with respect to yield, cost, and schedule.  All requests for information shall be directed to AFRL/PKVS by contacting Mr. Wayne Zitzka, at email wayne.zitzka@kirtland.af.mil, or via phone at (505)-846-4987.

<DESC>1. The Federal Aviation Administration is planning to compete its Enterprise Architecture and Solutions Environment (EASE) requirement.  With regard to planning, the EASE Program Office (PO) seeks comments on the attached draft Screening Information Request (SIR) and Statement of Work.  The draft SIR is without Sections L and M.  Those sections are currently being drafted.  The PO is open for written comment(s) only from the date of this announcement until October 31, 2005.  The PO does not intend to engage in written or verbal discussion with the author of the comment. Comments will merely be considered for use in enhancing the quality of the SIR.  In any event, the PO is not obligated to directly or indirectly respond either in writing or verbally to the author's comment.  Telephone comments or discussions are unacceptable and will not be entertained.  In view of the above discussion, please direct all comments to the following e-mail address:	glenn.a.Wilson@faa.gov 2. Market Survey:	In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the AMS, this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, small businesses (8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information in triplicate from interested vendors: Capability Statement - In view of the scope of the attached draft EASE SOW, this document should describe capability and identify past performance references concerning operation and maintenance of a computing facility of similar size and scope for five years within the past seven years, with an availability rate of 99% percent or better.  (Limited to 5 pages) Resumes - These resumes should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as key personnel in conjunction with the Key Personnel paragraph in the SIR. Expected approach to provide the computing facility, hardware and software components to augment FAA-provided equipment, disaster facilities, and staffing as stated in the SOW. Expected approach to migrate work to the new facility with not more than 72 hours service disruption. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  The FAA Acquisition Management System clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations On Subcontracting will apply. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form.  If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. Attached is the present draft of the statement of work.  The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this effort is 54153 (Size Standard is $21 Million). This market survey is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment, or a promise to contract by the Government.  This market survey does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition. However, the failure of adequate and appropriate 8(a) business or small business participation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition. With regard to this survey, interested respondents must submit information requested by the date and to the point of contact identified in paragraph one above.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   Amendment #2 Technical Questions Question #1:  In point number 14 of RFQ-OH-06-00007, does the specification require analysis of intact proteins (molecular weight assignment), identification from protein digests, or both? Additionally, is it acceptable to submit a quote  with the option for a second computer? Answer: The EPA will be looking at whole proteins and comparative analysis of different proteins after chemical treatment. This will not require sequencing subroutines, the EPA is looking at results at a rather bulk macroscale level, rather than elucidating  molecular structures of individual molecules.  The EPA's requirement requires the ability to do comparative analysis of chromatographs and mass spectra between samples. An offeror can submit an option for second computer in its quote, but the EPA budget constraints will determine the purchase of  any optional items.   Amendment #1 Technical Questions  Question #1: Requirement:  "Software for performing metabonomics analysis of data."  Please detail the type of data analysis/data reduction desired in terms of Metabonomics analysis of data.  Metabolomics is quite a large area of study.   EPA Answer:  The EPA requires Metabolite software to conduct comparative analysis between samples, independent of sample size.   Question #2:  Requirement:  "Combined Electrospray Ionization (ESI) and Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ion source".   Is this to say that the EPA does  not need or want dedicated ESI or APCI sources in the instrument proposal.  The dual ESI/APCI sources are not as sensitive as the dedicated ion sources.  EPA Answer:  The EPA will accept alternate quotes for separate ESI and APCI sources, but it is expected that quotes include the cost breakdown  for the option between combined sources and separate sources.  In addition, the contractor shall provide technical documentation in support of each of the proposed approaches. The last day for technical questions is Thursday October 27, 2005 by 3:00PM (EST). Quadrapole/Time of Flight (Q-TOF)  Tandem Mass Spectrometer    This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   Amendment #1 Technical Questions Could the EPA clarify this portion of the Specifications:  "Capable of meeting the following specifications: electric field microscopy, life-mode capabilities (i.e. magnetic interactions versus topography). Capable of providing preferred  simultaneous display of topography image and cantilever oscillation." Question #1:  Does the use of an inexpensive oscilloscope meet the requirements of "display", as compared to an alterative of generating stored data, an acquisition of an image or map? Answer:  It might be best to use an  example of an application:  The EPA looks at metal corrosion products frequently and is interested to know whether certain areas of the corrosion deposits are magnetic and/or electrically conductive, as well as possessing  the need to obtain topography information.   For this requirement the EPA  may also be interested to know whether the materials are reactive with certain other materials or chemical functional groups.  Question #2:  Oscillating cantilever may destroy a tip. Is the requirement to have an oscillating cantilever? Answer: The EPA would like to possess the ability to use  appropriate modified tips to answer the questions of reactivity.   It is the EPA's understanding that the simultaneous display of topographic and cantilever oscillation images will permit a qualitative comparison to be made between the material properties of samples.  Basically, the EPA is looking  for the capability of measuring both height and amplitude for a comparison of the area between the two images.   The Last day for Technical Questions is Thursday November 02, 2005.   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR  Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<DESC>Bulk fuel requirement for DF2 and MUM for Camp Cedar II, Iraq.
Diesel Fuel #2 (DF2), 83,950,000 USG (230,000 USG/ day), NSN: 9140-00-286-5294;   and Gasoline, Auto, Regular, 87 Auto (MUR), 18,250,000 USG (50,000 USG/day), NSN: 9130-01-272-0983.   Delivery Period is from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 plus a single six-month option period running from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007.   Option period quantity is 41,975,000 USG (230,000 USG/day) for DF2 and 9,125,000 USG (50,000 USG/day) for MUR.

Under the authority of FAR 6.302, this requirement has been re-identified for non-competitive contract action.  Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is deemed to be the only source capable of supplying the requirement.  Initially this was believed to be the case, but in the absence of any definitive evidence preventing the occurrence of competition, the notice was revised to open the solicitation to other interested parties.  Recently however, KPC has formally expressed that it is its sales policy to contract directly with end-users and not through third parties and that it would not be providing product or access to its facilities to any third party intending to supply DESC under this tender.  As KPC owns/controls the only facilities necessary for providing the requirement, it is not possible for any third party to tender a responsible offer.  Thus it is DESC’s intent to enter into a contractual arrangement with Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC).  

Other interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   However, all proposals received by 31 October 2005 will be considered by the Government.   A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement (Note #22).   Proposals are to be directed to the DESC Bid Custodian before the closing date and time to facsimile 703-767-0488.  E-mail offers will not be accepted.  See Note #12.

<DESC>Industry Poster Session for High-Throughput Antibody and Capture Reagent Technologies


Background

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has established a priority cancer research activity for development and evaluation of technologies for detection of human proteins and peptides in complex mixtures. As a component of the Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative, NCI is evaluating new models of research and business approaches to establish reagent resources to support these activities.  NCI is interested in identifying companies that have high throughput capabilities for production and characterization of antibodies or other capture technologies for highly sensitive and specific detection and quantification of proteins.

In association with the NCI Proteomic Technologies Reagents Resource Workshop being held at the Sofitel Chicago O’Hare Hotel December 12-13, 2005, NCI is sponsoring an industry poster session to be held on the afternoon/evening of December 12. The goal of the poster session is to provide an opportunity for companies or other interested parties that develop or use innovative high-throughput antibody and other capture method technologies to present their methods and technologies to workshop participants. This information will assist NCI and workshop participants in developing approaches to establishing reagent resources for broad access. 

You are invited to present a poster (4&#61602; × 6&#61602;) during an afternoon-evening session on December 12. We would encourage your company to staff the poster with someone who possesses the highest level of scientific/technical experience possible. You also may want to consider bringing handout materials or scientific materials about your technologies to the poster session.

Poster Session Criteria

To be considered, you are strongly encouraged to follow the guidelines below for the subject content that should be included in your poster: 

•	Describe in full detail the key advantages of your antibody/affinity capture production technology and some potential limitations.
•	Describe the methodologies used to produce the antibodies including the methodologies for epitope design, epitope production, cross-species reactivity, etc.
•	Does your company/laboratory produce polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, or both? Describe technological expertise in other affinity capture technologies, if any, such as affibodies or aptamers.
•	What are the throughput capabilities (amounts and time required) for making your capture reagent and can your technology be automated?
•	What is the average cost per antibody/affinity capture reagent that you would charge the scientific community if you were to offer it through the NCI proteomics reagent resource? Ranges would probably be fine, but estimates will be very helpful.
•	Describe the different formats in which the antibody/affinity capture reagent has been verified to be successful 
(e.g., Western, IHC, immunoprecipitation, ELISA, microarray, pre-mass spectrometry fractionation, etc.).
•	What validation methodologies are or can be used to ensure that your affinity capture reagent is binding to the target protein/peptide and verifying its specificity and sensitivity to the target protein/peptide?

Participation Instructions

If you wish to present a poster at this workshop, please provide contact information and a two to three paragraph description of the technology (with website URL) to Diane Chinn by email at dchinn@md.capconcorp.com by 
November 10, 2005. For technical information about the poster session, please contact Dr. Adam Clark, Office of Technology and Industrial Relations, National Cancer Institute, at (301) 496-1550 (phone), (301) 496-7807 (fax) or by

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Circular Advertising Company, Inc. (CAC), located at 99 Ray Road, Baltimore, Maryland for the Agency for Children and Families/Office of Child Support Enforcement (ACF/OCSE) on the basis of other than full and open competition.  The authority for this noncompetitive award is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide services needed to ensure the effective and timely printing and mailing of OCSE issued pre-offset notices.  The Federal Offset Program is a government-wide delinquent debt matching and payment offset system. It is a means of offsetting Federal payments due the delinquent debtor from the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program and the Administrative Offset Program.  It is a cooperative effort between the OCSE and the Treasury’s Financial Management Service (FMS).  CAC is the only known facility at this time that has the capability to provide the required standardization and continuity of these services.  Changing variables would hinder operations already in progress and would jeopardize the services performed by CAC which are critical to the ACF/OCSE for fulfillment of their organizational mission.  CAC is the only known source within a 50 mile radius of the customer that has a required on-site United States Postal Service facility in order to perform these services.  CAC possesses the requisite capabilities to provide the continuity of services without disruption and duplication of cost to the Government.  It is anticipated that this requirement will result in a firm-fixed-price contract for a base period of one year with four one-year options.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541860, and the small business size standard is $6,000,000.  Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit written documentation that demonstrates the ability to respond to this requirement within 15 days from the date of publication of this notice.  This notice is NOT a request for proposals.  Capability statements received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses must be in writing and refer to 06Y008319 to the attention of Susan Moran.  If no affirmative responses are received, the Contracting Officer will proceed with a contract award to CAC.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS AN 8(a) SET-ASIDE; 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SIZE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.  The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research to understand, and ultimately prevent and/or treat, infectious and immune-mediated diseases that continue to threaten millions of lives each year.   The Respiratory Diseases Branch (RDB), DMID, NIAID, NIH, has a requirement for a multi-disciplinary clinical research contract in tuberculosis to integrate, basic and human clinical research to help answer outstanding critical questions in human tuberculosis. This is a recompetition of Contract Number N01-AI-95383 with Case Western Reserve University.  A solicitation will be issued seeking a contractor that will support an established consortium of investigators and institutions with expertise in the areas of epidemiology, microbiology, and immunity to conduct multi-disciplinary, multi-national research of host-pathogen interactions in tuberculosis (TB). The overall goal of the clinical studies to be carried out by the contract is to fill critical gaps in translational TB research and to provide tools needed to advance new health care interventions. The Contractor will conduct and direct specific studies that are expected to provide answers to long-standing questions about the interaction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) with its human host and to contribute to the successful development of new health care interventions. These questions include: (1) Why does Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) protect some individuals from TB disease and not others and what are the kinetics of the immune response after vaccination with BCG versus after infection with Mtb? Answers to this question are expected to facilitate the selection of boosting strategies for vaccine studies of the human immune response to BCG in target populations, such as children, and to better define clinical endpoints and expected outcomes for new vaccines; (2) Why do most individuals successfully control Mtb infection while others progress to active disease? The answers to this question are expected to facilitate characterization of infected persons and those at highest risk of progression to active disease for entry into clinical studies and facilitate the development of diagnostics; (3) What immune responses or other biological markers that predict relevant clinical outcomes can be measured in response to drug therapy and vaccines? The answers to these questions are expected to define early surrogate markers of efficacy and possible approaches for combining drug therapy with vaccination strategies. Clinical studies to be carried out under this contract will be conducted in TB endemic countries (see Dye et al.- http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/282/7/677) with substantial contributions by local investigators and, where possible, will include the creation of data that will be relevant to TB care and research in the host countries. The collaboration must include at least one country outside of the United States in which TB is endemic and which offers an established infrastructure capable of carrying out the clinical studies, including local investigators experienced in the conduct of multi-disciplinary human clinical research in TB, laboratory facilities and personnel to perform protocol-specific tests, and access to appropriate patient populations.  The contract shall also include a Data Management Center for the receipt, storage, quality control and evaluation of all data derived from this contract, and a Specimen Repository for the storage and inventory of mycobacterial strains and human-derived materials.  Supporting non-clinical studies, as well as administrative management may be conducted in the U.S. or non-U.S. countries.  Information submitted in your capability statement shall be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration in each of the following qualifications:   (1) Expertise in the design and conduct of high quality clinical studies in TB endemic countries (see Dye et al.- http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/282/7/677) in accordance with all requirements listed in 45 CFR 46, or equivalent international guidelines, for the conduct of ethical and safe human subjects research; (2) Expertise in managing complex, multi-disciplinary studies in human TB; (3) Expertise with ethics committees and human subjects review boards in TB endemic countries; (4) Expertise in TB research and thorough knowledge of the status of clinical TB research, as well as applied knowledge in related fundamental and translational research areas such as human immunology; (5) Availability of/access to collaborators and clinical research infrastructure in TB endemic countries with the expertise to conduct human clinical studies in TB; (6) Laboratory infrastructure in TB endemic countries and/or in the U.S. or other non U.S. countries to provide, where applicable, immunology, microbiology, and biochemistry support; (7) Access to relevant volunteer and patient populations needed to conduct clinical studies in TB endemic countries; (8) Personnel in the U.S. and/or non U.S. countries and in TB endemic countries who are experienced in conducting human clinical studies and laboratory studies needed for the development of tools and assays for human clinical studies; (9) Expertise in developing and operating specimen repositories, and in developing and maintaining databases to support specimen and clinical data; and (10) Expertise in the development and operation of database systems for the receipt, storage and quality control of clinical and non clinical study data.  The Government anticipates a single award.  The NIAID recognizes that a single organization or institution may not have all the expertise and facilities necessary to carry out this requirement. Consequently, a contractor would be expected to include collaborations and subcontracts with qualified U.S. and/or non-U.S. institutions to provide the scientific and technical expertise and resources needed for human clinical studies in TB. The contractor shall utilize already established and well experienced clinical collaborations and infrastructure in TB endemic countries to conduct research, as well as an established clinical data management infrastructure to conduct this work.  Small business and 8(a) contractors are reminded that in order to quality as a set-aside, 51% of the direct labor must be performed by the prime contractor.  It should be noted that this contract will NOT support the establishment and development of new clinical trial infrastructure and capacity at TB endemic sites or the evaluation of new diagnostics, drug and vaccine candidates that are submitted by the research community for clinical testing.  However, the contract  may integrate experimental and/or approved drugs, vaccines and/or diagnostics into its clinical studies to define and validate markers that will provide improved information for future human clinical studies for TB interventions.   It is anticipated that the duration of the contracts will be a maximum of seven (7) years with an anticipated total effort of approximately 29 FTEs. Interested organizations are encouraged to respond and are required to submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing the areas cited above.  Please identify the NAICS and size status of your organization.  See Government-Wide Numbered Note 22.  NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<ARCHDATE>01272006
<CONTACT>Pam Willis, 256-955-3388
<DESC>This special announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in the SMDC SETAC recompetition at the prime contractor level; and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those interested small busin ess firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level.  The briefings and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firms or teams ability to perform, however, these will be utilized to ma ke final decision concerning number and types of set-asides.  The responses to this notice are for Government planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a definitive intent to proceed with this acquisition. At this time, the Government does not intend to award more than seven (7) SETACs.  Further, we are exploring the potential to maximize set-aside opportunities for the SETAC program.  As the Government is unsure of the extent of anticipated small and small disadvantaged business participation, it is undecided as to the specific number and/or types of set-aside awards to target during the development of its acquisition strategy.  Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award  of a set-aside contract, PROVIDING THAT EACH TEAM MEMBER MEETS THE NAICS CODE SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD.    The current Small Business Administrative (SBA) rules allow a set-aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small business teams when at least 50% of the services will be performed by the collective efforts of all small busi ness members of the team.  The current SBA 8(a) affiliation rules allow joint ventures or teams when the 8(a) concern performs a significant amount of the work with its own employees and the size of at least one 8(a) participant to the joint venture is l ess than one half the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract.  Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA.  A Service-Disabled Veteran Owned-Small Business Concern (SDVO-SBC) prime contractor can subcontract part of a SDVO contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel on the concerns employees or on the employees of other SDVO-SBCs.  A joint venture of at least one SDVO-SBC and one or more oth er business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a competitive SDVO-SBC procurement so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract.  A qualified HUBZone SBC prime contractor can subcontract part  of a HUBZone contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel on the concerns employees or on the employees of other qualified HUBZone SBCs.   A joint venture of two or more qualified HUBZone SBCs m ay submit an offer for a HUBZone contract so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract.  The joint venture itself need not be certified as a qualified HUBZone.  Further information regarding teaming and joint  ventures are located in the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR 124 and 125).  NOTICE CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL FOR A WOMAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE:  If the implementing guidelines for a woman-owned set-aside are in place in a timely manner to allow  for such under the SETAC acquisition, the Government will consider such an award, therefore, if such companies/teams are interested in pursuing this opportunity, you may also express your interest in/schedule a capability briefing which is explained below . The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 1000 employees for this acquisition.   The contractors will be expected to provide non-personal services for systems engineering and technical assistance in support of the Mission and Function Statements for the US Ar my Space and Missile Defense Command, Huntsville and Washington DC; Program Executive Office - Missile and Space; and Other Government Agencies related to air, space, and/or missile defense.  This support is both broad ranging and ever changing.  The curre nt SETAC scope of work (SOW) has seven (7) functional areas:  (1) Requirements Definition, Integration, and Planning; (2) Technology Development, System Development, Assessment, and Validation; (3) Threat Estimation/Projections; (4) Weapons Lethality and E ffects Estimation; (5) Modeling, Simulation and Interfacing; (6) Program/Project Analysis, Evaluation, Experimentation, and Support; and (7) Production and Fielding Support. The follow-on acquisition is anticipated to have the same or similar functional ar eas as well as possible additional functional areas including Warfighter Support and Homeland Defense Support.  This acquisition will result in multiple awards with identical SOWs and numbers of Direct Productive Person-Hours (DPPHs).  The contracts will c onsist of fixed-price labor categories and cost reimbursable travel and materials line items.   The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other  proposing teams).  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award.  The resultant contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC), Program Executive Office - Missile and Space (PEO-MS), GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE (GMD) JOINT PROGRAM OFFICE (JPO), and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) contracts.  To the greatest extent pos sible, while still protecting the Governments interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractors actual SETAC performance.

Interested firms should submit an email stating your interest in presenting such a briefing to the Government within 30 days after the date of this announcement to Cynthia Smith at cynthia.smith@smdc.army.mil (title  email SETAC 07 Capability Briefing).  Large business requests for capability briefing opportunities as a prime contractor are not desired at this time.  Capability presentations must mirror how you plan to propose.  If proposing as a team, the presentat ion must reflect the team and team approach. The capability presentations/briefings will not be scheduled earlier than 60 days from the date of this synopsis.  The capability presentations should focus on issues that affect the decision as to number/types of set-aside awards such as: (1) the breadth and depth of technical and management expertise to successfully execute all SETAC roles, (2) the capability to quickly ramp up qualified and trained personnel at the onset of the contract, (3) the capability to administer and manage an indefinite delivery/ indefinite quantity, task order contract (expected as a minimum to be $100M per year for the total program) with numerous subcontractors, (4) assurance and demonstration that the small business firm or small business team will perform 50% of the work, (5) capability to perform realistic cost and schedule projections for complex technical and integration efforts, (6) a contract management structure that allows for an integrated organization accountable for total performance responsibility, and (7) an underst anding of Army, DoD, and Government Agencies with whom USASMDC and PEO-AMD interface.

<SUBJECT>A -- DEVELOPMENT OF LOW PHASE NOISE FREQUENCY SYNTHESIS
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Time and Frequency Division proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Colorado for the development of low phase noise frequency synthesis.  NIST is engaging in new programs in spectrum analysis and calibration services for industrial, military, and commercial organizations.  PM /AM noise measurements require traceability and certification of microwave components like oscillators, amplifiers, etc.  NIST seeks research associate assistance that is specific to the development of novel analysis techniques, characterizations, and standard calibration methodologies.  Presently, NIST’s best technique for noise measurement is a two-channel cross correlation measurement. NIST expects the noise of oscillators and amplifiers to be much lower than what is measured presently. In order to measure noise of components accurately, NIST needs a measurement system which has a lower noise floor than the current systems being used.  The University of Colorado will assist in the research development of new state of the art frequency synthesis.  The research associate will be responsible for writing reports, instructions, and other documentation that are consistent with plans for implementing the new calibration techniques and services developed.  The research must be conducted at the NIST, Boulder Campus in close cooperation with the Time and Frequency Metrology Group.
The research group at the University of Colorado is uniquely qualified in this area as demonstrated by the collaborative research throughout the last two years.  The contract period is November 10, 2005 through November 9, 2006.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred).  Anticipated award date is November 10, 2005.

<SUBJECT>H -- Bullet-Resistant Body Armor Requirements
<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) only.  The National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Office of Justice Programs (OJP), is the research, development, and evaluation agency of the U.S. Department of Justice.  NIJ provides objective, independent, evidence-based knowledge and tools to enhance the administration of justice and public safety.  NIJ does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI. 

On August 24, 2005, NIJ introduced the NIJ 2005 Interim Requirements for Bullet-Resistant Body Armor, which can be found at the following site: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bvpbasi/docs/08_18_05BodyArmor_int_reqts.doc. These requirements modify and supplement NIJ's Standard-0101.04, Ballistic Resistance of Personal Body Armor, which can be found at http://www.nlectc.org/pdffiles/0101.04RevA.pdf. They are promulgated on an interim basis to address recent NIJ research findings that indicate that certain body armor models previously found by NIJ to be compliant with earlier NIJ requirements for ballistic resistance of new body armor (including NIJ Standard-0101.04) may not adequately maintain ballistic performance during their service life.  In conjunction with the Interim Requirements, NIJ administers a voluntary body armor compliance testing program.  Armor samples are submitted to NIJ, where they are inspected to ensure they meet labeling and workmanship requirements.  The samples are then ballistically tested for compliance with the Interim Requirements/NIJ Standard at independent laboratories that have been certified by NIJ. 

This RFI is issued solely to solicit technical input from public safety officials/agencies and industry for consideration by NIJ as it revises its ballistic body armor standard.  No product demonstrations or marketing presentations will be scheduled as a result of this market research/information gathering announcement.  Specifically, through this RFI, NIJ seeks to gather operational performance requirements and testing methodologies that public safety officials and industry representatives feel should be included in future revisions to the NIJ 2005 Interim Requirements for Bullet-Resistant Body Armor.  NIJ is interested in obtaining suggested operational requirements and testing methodologies, along with the rationale for these suggestions.  Where possible, respondents should provide supporting information and technical data that may provide a basis for the suggested change.

NIJ is interested, though not exclusively, in operational requirements and testing methodologies that address:

•	Validation of  used armor performance;
•	Non-destructive testing/monitoring methods for used armor to ensure ongoing performance;
•	Improved requirements and testing protocols for new armor (e.g. blunt trauma, multi-shot impacts, contact shots,);
•	Numbers and sizes of samples to be tested;
•	Long-term performance of armor;
•	Artificial armor aging protocols to replicate field use;
•	Quality control and conformity assessments

Responses to this RFI should be submitted no later than November 14, 2005, in order to ensure full consideration.  The narrative section of your response (summary of recommendations) should not exceed 7 double-spaced pages.  Company information, abstract, table of contents, charts, figures, appendices, and data and information supporting the recommendations, do not count toward the 7-page limit for the narrative section.  Responses must be sent via overnight express mail, and include the vendor’s company name, address, point of contact name, e-mail address, and telephone number.  Any proprietary or company confidential information provided in the response must be clearly marked on every applicable page of the response provided.

<SUBJECT>D--Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Local Exchange Services
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Revenue Center, Topeka, KS intends to award a sole source contract for a comprehensive set of local exchange services, analog and digital access transport services and an inter and intra Local Access Transport Area (LATA) interconnect function in support of the VA HRC call center.  Services include providing telecommunication lines for DID/DOD and multiplex capability.  The Government intends to award a contract for a six month term with an additional six month extension possible IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (1) to SBC Communications of Kansas City, Missouri.  The DVA HRC presently operates a nationwide call center that is supported by SBC Communications.  The DVA Acquisitions Operation Service recently made award under proposals received in response to RFP VHA-071 for replacement of the existing telecommunications switch. A post award protest has been filed with GAO by an unsuccessful offeror. The installation of the new phone switch has been delayed pending the outcome of the protest and this will also likely change the future requirements for the local exchange services. This action is a follow on to the previously synopsized requirement for local exchange services and contract V102P-0006. This sole source award is made to provide continuity of operations and to ensure that all services are compatible and interchangeable with the present system.  This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to meet these requirements.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination to conduct a competitive procurement will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. Phone inquiries will not be accepted. Responses related to this notice shall be in writing and must be received no later than November 07, 2005. POC Barry Fetzer, DVA HRC, 3401 SW 21, Bldg 9, Topeka, KS 66604.  Phone request will not be honored. The value of this acquisition is above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.  This is a simplified acquisition.*****

<SUBJECT>R--Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Revenue Center, Topeka, KS intends to award a sole source contract for call center assessment services to Incoming Call Management Institute of Annapolis Maryland. The Government intends to award this contract IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (1).  The DVA HRC presently operates several  nationwide call centers with the primary mission to provide various support services to current and former veterans and their spouses.  The DVA HRC made award in March of 2005 to ICMI under competitive proposals received in response to the RFQ for call center services. This action will serve as a follow on contract that incorporates information and analysis from award of the original contract 702-C50015.  It is anticipated that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost for work already performed that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Award to any other source would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency’s requirements related to upgrading call center operations.  This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to meet these requirements.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Each quarter the Fitness Centers hosts  at least one fun run for base personnel and family members to participate.  Themes and routes vary depending on the season.  The fun runs have shown  the most potential for growth. Tree Lighting Ceremony (December 2005 & 2006) This year we are celebrating  the season with a tree lighting ceremony placing special emphasis on  children with parents serving overseas.  Our hope is to have each child  place a yellow ribbon on the tree for their parent and receive a  complimentary gift.  Immediately following the tree lighting we will  proceed to the Community Center for hot drinks and Santa’s workshop. New Years Eve Celebrations (December 31, 2005) Celebrate the New Year with  the folks at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

The March Madness Bowling Tournament is a fun filled evening  with plenty of bowling, prizes and food on hand.  The tournament will be  comprised of a bracket system to name the champion with no-tap (when  bowler knocks down 9 pins it counted as a strike!).  March Madness is a  fun way to spend the evening for both the accomplished and novice bowler. Kids Safety Day (April 2006) Kids Safety Day brings safety plans and ideas  to the youth and families of the Wright-Patterson Community.

Families can take advantage of having experts on hand to  answer all their travel questions. Motorcycle Safety Day (May 2006) Motorcycle Safety Day is an exciting  event to promote safety on the roads.  The event provides motorcycle  operators the opportunity to work together to maximize their skills and  reduce their chances of mishaps, and have fun in the process.  The day  will begin with a safety briefing, a motorcycle ride throughout the base  ending in the soccer fields by the Air Force Museum for a motorcycle  exposition.

Requirements for Lifting of Equipment
1.	The equipment shall be outfitted with suitable attachments for overhead lifting.
1.1.	For multiple point lifts each lifting attachment shall be capable of supporting one half the gross weight of the equipment with a design factor of five to one based on ultimate strength.  For single point lifts the lifting attachment shall be capable of supporting the gross weight of the equipment with a design factor of five to one based on ultimate strength.
1.2.	For multiple point lifts each lifting attachment shall be designed to accept a standard anchor shackle (Federal Specification RR-C-271D, type IVA) which is capable of supporting one half the gross weight of the equipment.  For single point lifts the lifting attachment shall be designed to accept a standard anchor shackle (Federal Specification RR-C-271D, type IVA) which is capable of supporting the gross weight of the equipment.
1.3.	Design of the lifting attachments shall be such that the attachments and shackles are not side loaded more than 10° out of the plane.  Lifting attachments shall be located such that the lifting slings do not contact the equipment, or alternatively a spreader beam certified to NAVFAC P-307 shall be provided.  Whenever practical, the lifting attachments shall be located above the center of gravity, and such that the lifting slings do not contact the equipment housings.
1.4.	Each lifting attachment shall be conspicuously marked in a contrasting color “Lift Here”.  Letters shall have a minimum height of 1”.
2.	The equipment shall be marked in a prominent location with the gross weight.  Sand hoppers, tubs, or other containers that may contain material shall be marked with the empty and full weight (or alternatively the empty weight and working load limit).  Marking shall be upper case letters of a contrasting color, with a minimum height of 1”.  Marking shall include the units (i.e. “pounds”, “long tons”, etc.).
3.	The equipment shall be provided with a lifting sketch / rigging diagram that meets the requirements of enclosure (1).
3.1.	The lifting sketch shall detail any specific requirements and / or configurations that must be meet prior to lifting (i.e. “engage swing lock”, “Tilt mast back fully”, “Rotate lifting basket over side”, “Utilize 10’ minimum length slings”, “Spreader beam required”, etc.).
3.2.	The lifting sketch shall include the location of the center of gravity of the equipment (full fuel, hydraulic tanks, etc.), equipment model/manufacturer, and gross weight.
3.3.	A copy of the lifting sketch shall be permanently posted on the equipment, and a copy shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer.
4.	If specialized handling gear other than shackles, standard slings, or chainfalls (i.e. spreader beams, special lift rigs, etc.) is required, the contractor shall furnish it.  This handling gear shall be provided certified in accordance with NAVFAC P-307, with written documentation of proof testing.
 
Rigging Sketch Requirements
Rigging sketches, as a minimum, shall identify the following:
1.	The weight of the load.
2.	The location of the center of gravity.
3.	The minimum crane capacity.
4.	The minimum capacity / length of slings.
5.	The minimum capacity of other standard rigging gear.
6.	The attachment (lifting) points for the load.
(a)	The attachment points for multiple leg lifts shall be sized such that each attachment point can support half the load’s weight at the anticipated lift angle.
(b)	The attachment point for single leg lifts shall be sized such that the attachment point can support the entire load’s weight.
7.	Limitations on allowable orientations for any parts making up the lifting assembly.
8.	For single leg vertical lifts using twisted rope (wire or synthetic), two parallel ropes each capable of supporting the entire load alone shall be required unless a method is used to prevent unlaying the rope.
9.	A minimum D/d ratio of one shall be required where wire rope slings pass over any object, or in the eyes of wire rope slings.  A minimum D/d ratio of two shall be required where synthetic rope slings pass over any object, or in the eyes of synthetic rope slings.
(a)	"D" represents the diameter of the object the sling passes over.
(b)	"d" represents the diameter of the sling.
(c)	Table 14-3 of NAVFAC P-307 lists efficiency factors at various D/d ratios.
10.	Components in each handling assembly shall be sized based on the worst case distribution of loads.
(a)	When making a two, three, or four point lift, the handling gear shall be sized so that two legs can support the load without exceeding the safe working load (SWL) at the lift angle expected, unless an equalizing method is used.
11.	When non standard gear is required (i.e. round stock lifting bars) written instructions shall be provided that ensure:
(a)	The proper material is being used,
(b)	The item is certified IAW NAVFAC P-307,
(c)	Any special requirements or dimensions are followed to ensure that engineering assumptions are met (i.e. eccentricity of the bearing points).
