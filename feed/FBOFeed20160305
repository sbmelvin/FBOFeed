<DESC><p>This effort is for an F-15 definitive acquisition using Full and Open Competition after exclusions of Sources procedures under FAR 6.204. Competition will be limited to 8(a) contractors.</p>
<p>This acquisition will provide Engineering and Technical Services for seven specific task areas.</p>
<p>(1) The first task is to support F-15 Technical Assistance Data System (TADS). The AFLCMC/WWQE has F-l 5s at about 20 locations all over the world; AFLCMC/WWQE uses the TADS to address technical assistance for the warfighters. TADS include Maintenance Assistance Requests (MARs) and Technical Assistance Requests (TARs) in order to streamline the requests that do not need production's coordination or money. MARs are used when the unit needs a solution that requires a depot field team or depot tooling shipped to their location. TARs are used when the unit only needs engineering and/or technical guidance. <br />(2) The second task is the support updating our Work Specifications thru the Engineering Requirements Development Packets (ERDP) process. The AFLCMC/WWQE has maintenance workers doing replacement and repairs of F-15s at Robins and overseas, our Work Specifications (Work Specs) tell those workers what they should be doing to these F-15s. <br />(3) The third task is the Configuration Management task. The Configuration Management portion of this task order is to ensure the system's operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness through disciplined requirement and configuration change management processes. This requires tracking all proposed configuration changes to the F-15 operational baseline, ensuring that all change packages conform to the technical requirements, and that all change packages are properly reviewed, coordinated and approved through processes established in the F-15 Systems Engineering Plan. <br />(4) The fourth task is analysis of the Individual Aircraft Tracking Program. The Individual Aircraft Tracking Program, TADS, and Data Management parts of this task order is to maintain collection and processing of data that is of utmost importance to our Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) Manager and the structural integrity of our system, maintain F-15 TADS.<br />(5) The fifth task is documenting repairs and damage for engineers to utilize when designing repairs and doing analysis. The Wing and Fuselage Repair Data Collection will ensure that inspections are done correctly and that AFLCMC/WWQE engineers have electronic access to the data. <br />(6) The sixth task is to process our first articles and 339s. <br />(7) The seventh task is to provide reliability and maintainability support.</p>
<p>The planned acquisition strategy is one 12 month basic with four 12-month options.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal; however, only 8(a) contractors will be considered by the Agency. DD Form 254 Contract Security Classification Specification applies - Foreign Contractors are not allowed to participate.</p>
<p>Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation number FA8505-16-R-0017 issue date is planned to be within the next 30 days. No Questions will be taken or answered prior to the release of the RFP package.</p>

Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of   the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available  to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the
quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the
design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government   engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the
Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the
intended application.

<DESC>Notice: The Defense Health Agency (DHA) announces its decision to partner with GSA to satisfy its Health Information Technology (HIT) requirements. Market research determined there is overlap with the Alliant GWAC contractors and former D/SIDDOMS prime contractors, and DHA has determined utilization of the GSA suite of contracts will best satisfy its HIT requirements.
<p>In order to promote outcome standardization and gain cost and process efficiencies, DHA will satisfy its HIT requirements through individual task orders placed against one of the following GSA suite of contracts: Alliant, Alliant SB, 8(a) Stars II, VETS, and Schedule 70. To facilitate onboarding of new technological solutions as efficiently as possible, DHA will work with GSA's Schedule 70 program to create a new HIT Special Item Number (SIN) aligned with DHA and other Federal agencies' requirements.</p>
<p>DHA will hold an industry day to share its strategy with the HIT contractor community. GSA will discuss the work it is doing to create a Schedule 70 HIT Special Item Number (SIN), the GWAC programs, and future Alliant 2 and Vets 2 contracts. The industry day will cover the following:<br />&middot; DHA HIT strategy overview<br />&middot; Opportunity forecast of DHA Health IT requirements<br />&middot; Schedule 70 Health IT SIN - overview and timeline of Health IT SIN, getting on Schedule, modifying contracts, how to be involved<br />&middot; GWACs - overview of GWACs, subcontracting on Alliant, 8a Stars II and Vets; getting a contract on Alliant 2 or Vets 2</p>
<p>GSA's suite of contracts was chosen with a comprehensive business agreement in mind that addressed costs, risk, schedule, contracting support, and the ability to provide HIT services.</p>
<p>Where/When: The Industry day is scheduled to be held on 20 January 2016 at the GSA Central Office, 1800 F Street NW, Washington, DC 20405. There will be a morning session starting at 9:00 AM and an afternoon session starting at 1:00 PM. DHA and GSA will present the same information each session.

<DESC>GSA Building entrance update - Major construction under the front entrance doors at 1800 F will start January 18 and continue through approximately late May (depending on the weather). The foundation underneath the two-way doors, the revolving door, and the ramp leading to the front entrance will undergo major refurbishment. The doors and ramp will need to be closed, one at a time, while the foundation is repaired. The 100-year-old concrete underneath that area is in need of a 21st century upgrade.
<p>The two-way entrance door closest to 18th Street will be the first doorway to be closed and repaired, followed by the revolving door, and finally the western two-way door and ramp leading to the front entrance. Two front entrance doorways will always be open, with only one under construction at any one time.</p>
<p>If you wish to avoid this inconvenience, consider using the E Street entrance.</p>

<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI. No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.

A more complete description of the supplies and/or services sought for this project is provided below.</p>
<p>FEMA requires a "phased" approach in addressing the needed data profiling, cleansing and migration rather than a single all-encompassing approach.
