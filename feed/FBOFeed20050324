In order to determine if a source is qualified to participate the FAA will require a Capability statement - This document should contain at a minimum: (a) Manufacturing capability to produce AFCB in an aerospace quality controlled facility and certifications; (b) AFCB testing and Qualification Facilities; (c) Engineering Support for the project; (d) Drawings of the proposed devices with performance capabilities defined; (e) Lead time for production AFCB, and, (f) Cost for AFCB.  Sources will be selected based on their ability to provide AFCB's that will meet all the FAA's defined criteria from this survey and all support documentation for the STC application. The Government reserves the right to include additional minimum qualification requirements in the resultant survey. Interested parties should submit their response to this survey electronically to anna.marinaro@faa.gov, or via hard copy to Anna Marinaro, ACX-52, FAA William J.

<SOLNBR>AG-0325-S-05-0004
<CONTACT>Marsha Harris, Contract Specialist, Phone 406-587-6859, Fax 406-587-6808, Email marsha.harris@mt.usda.gov
<DESC>(1)  Description of Work:
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture, has a clearly defined Policy on Range (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/ECS/graze/reg9500.html) which provides for many sustainable rangeland benefits, including “continuing research and technology developments to enhance range conservation and productivity and to make optimum use of all range resources”.   Developing and maintaining ecological site descriptions is one way to achieve this goal.  NRCS policy and responsibilities for developing, correlating and describing rangeland ecological site descriptions are contained in NRCS National Range and Pasture Handbook and NRCS National Soil Survey Handbook.  

In order to accomplish this task, the NRCS will award a contract(s) that require the successful contractors to write selected, identified portions of ecological site descriptions in the following Performance Groups:

(1)A.  Performance Group 1:  Rangeland Resource Unit (RRU) 44XS within the state of Montana.  A map of the RRUs can be found at http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/ecs/range/ecolsites/44s.html.  There are 17 sites to be completed in the Base Year.  More sites may be identified for future years.  Eight of these sites will require field data collection.  Existing NRCS data for each site will be provided to the contractor.  

(1)B.  Performance Group 2:  Rangeland Resource Unit (RRU) 43BS within the state of Montana.  A map of the RRUs can be found at http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/ecs/range/ecolsites/43bs.html.  There are 16 sites to be completed in the Base Year.  More sites may be identified for future years.  Eight of these sites will require field data collection.  Existing NRCS data for each site will be provided to the contractor.  

Sites that need additional data collected by the contractor will be identified after the contract(s) is awarded.  Each of those 8 sites will need to have a minimum of 5 additional double sampling transects performed by the contractor.  Appropriate NRCS data collection protocols will need to be adhered to.  Those protocols can be found in Chapter 4, NRCS National Range and Pasture Handbook at ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/GLTI/technical/publications/nrph/nrph-ch4.pdf.  Species composition and production will be determined using the Double Sampling method.  Site location for double sampling transects will be coordinated with the contractor and NRCS specialists.  Only sites approved by NRCS will be inventoried.

The performance period for the base year begins June 27, 2005 and ends February 28, 2006.  Options will also be included for the 2006 through 2007 inventories (3 years total).

The Contractor shall acquire (from NRCS) and assemble all NRCS plot data, soil/ecological site correlation data, digital photos and type location coordinates.  For sites in which field data collection is necessary, all transect forms (SCS-Range-417) will be delivered to the NRCS State Rangeland Management Specialist in original format at the end of the contract period.  The Contractor shall use all data, combined with personal/professional knowledge of these ecosystems, NRCS Area Rangeland Management Specialist knowledge, and peer review group knowledge to write specific portions of each ecological site description for the 35 ecological sites identified separately.  Ecological site descriptions must be written using recognized NRCS soil survey terminology. 

 (2) Government Furnished Data:  The NRCS will furnish rangeland transect information, type location data and digital photos to the contractor.  All data furnished shall be returned in the same condition to NRCS upon completion of the contract.  

Field data collection will be required on roughly one-half of the ecological sites to be completed during the Base Year.  Field data collection in the Option Years is anticipated on most sites identified.

(3)  Workload and Logistics:

(3)A.  For ecological sites that do not need field data collected:
It is anticipated that one ecological site description will take approximately 30 hours to write the first draft, and approximately 10 hours to assemble all NRCS and peer group comments to develop the final draft.  The bulk of the time will be in data assembly, review and fleshing-out the state and transition model with associated plant community narratives.  NRCS will provide an MSWord template for the contractor to complete for each ecological site description.  

(3)B.  For ecological sites that need field data collected:
In addition to the work required under A, the contractor will also have to perform the following on 8 sites in each performance group.  It is estimated that no more than 2 double sampling transects will be completed within a 10-hour day.  This assumes that 2 sampling locations are relatively close to each other.  There will also be additional time invested in working with the local NRCS specialist to secure landowner permissions to conduct sampling on private or tribal lands.  The contractor will need to work closely with NRCS to determine appropriate field locations for data collection, and to access sites located on private land.  Inventoried sites should have a similarity index greater than 70 percent. 

The contractor will be required to attend a week-long training session, July 5-8, 2005 at field and office locations at a location to be specified in the solicitation.  This session is designed to familiarize the contractor with NRCS protocols, ecological site concepts, state and transition model development, and other items essential to the development of these descriptions.  The contractor will be expected to work with all partners (NRCS, peer review group, etc) to gather as much knowledge about each ecological site as possible.  The contractor will also be expected to read applicable peer-reviewed literature to include the latest technology and research into each description.  Much of the work on these ecological site descriptions during the Base Year is anticipated to be indoor “office” work.

(4)  Confidentiality Statement:
In the event that field data needs to be collected to augment the ecological site description(s), the
successful contractor(s) will be required to sign a confidential agreement for non-disclosure of confidential information relative to data site locations and/or use of composite data.  This confidentiality statement is only necessary where actual field data is collected.  The Statement of Work will identify the ecological sites where field data collection is needed, if at all.  Specific field locations will be identified after the contract is awarded.

(5)  A solicitation for this effort will be issued on or about April 26, 2005.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate (AFRL/SNA) is issuing a single step (full initial proposal), 6 year, open-ended Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit research proposals for the Advanced Technologies for the Software Protection Initiative program (ATSPI). Multiple contract awards and/or assistance instruments are anticipated with an estimated value of $2.0M or less with typical periods of performance of 6-24 months including final report.   (1)  RESEARCH NEED:  ATSPI seeks to identify and promote research topics that provide software protection technologies for the OSD Software Protection Initiative (SPI).  The overall objective of the ATSPI BAA is to identify, study, research and develop the key technologies needed to strengthen current software protection capabilities for scientific, engineering, and modeling/simulation software that executes on general-purpose computers spanning HPC clusters to advanced desktop machines.  The anticipated ATSPI Focused Research Topics (FRTs) support the SPI program and include the following research areas:  1) Protection Against Unauthorized Use/Theft/Piracy where this research involves such areas as hardware/software node-locking and other means to protect application software on general purpose computers;  2)  Protection Against Reverse Engineering where this research involves areas such as disassemblers, decompilers, obfuscation techniques, binary editors, and debuggers;  3)  Secure Distribution and Tracking Methods where this research involves areas such as distribution management/accountability, encryption, and watermarking;  4)  Secure Application Development Tools where this research involves areas such as virtual machines, special encryption methods, specialized computer hardware, special editors, software pedigree development/management, and tools/methodologies for security of object/component based elements of software applications;  5)  Software Benchmarks, Measures of Effectiveness, and Measures of Performance where this research involves areas such  as the definition, development, and evaluation of science-based software protection metrics, the development of software applications for use in benchmarking protection techniques, and the development of software protection technology tools and theory.  (2) BACKGROUND: Historically, the ability to effectively exploit high performance computing depends upon the availability of high performance computer systems and application software that can execute on these systems.  The combination of these two technologies has enabled advances in defense science and technology and has provided the computational capability that is a key component of maintaining US national security.  Because of the perceived national value of HPC assets, these assets have been protected almost from their very inception.  Traditionally, the strategy employed to maintain the US lead in the HPC arena has consisted of two parts: (1) research and development to insure the maintenance of superior technology and (2) export controls to restrict access by potential adversaries to these assets.  Recently, rapid advances in computer hardware technology (e.g. Linux clusters) have rendered export controls on high performance computer systems ineffective.  At this time, there is no reason to believe that this trend is reversible and there are many reasons to believe that it will instead worsen with time.  Concomitantly, there has been an increasing realization that the software (executing on these high performance computers) is the crucial intellectual property that must be protected.  The wide spread availability of computer clustering technology in conjunction with the realization that DoD software has a tremendous intellectual value mandates stronger protection of application software. This insures continued US superiority in research and development of advanced weapon systems along with superiority in the generation of scientific and technical intelligence.  In December 2001, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics directed the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Science and Technology) to establish the Software Protection Initiative (SPI) to improve the protection of critical national security application software.  The SPI goals are to slow the acquisition of DoD application software by adversaries, make cost-prohibitive the exploitation of DoD software when it does leak, and insure technology/policy protection measures are appropriately applied balancing mission requirements and software security.  The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Science and Technology) appointed the Air Force Research Laboratory as the Office of Primary Responsibility for management and execution of the DoD Software Protection Initiative.  The Advanced Technologies for the Software Protection Initiative (ATSPI) identifies, investigates, develops, evolves, and matures the R&D software protection technology base for the SPI.  This initial BAA solicits research proposals in Focused Research Topics (FRT)  #1, #2, #3 and #4 only (see http://www.eps.gov/).  (3) Proposal Information:  Proposal instructions are contained in the solicitation and specific FRT on the EPS homepage (http://www/eps.gov/).  Proposals for these four topic areas are due on  15 July 2002, 4:00 PM, local time.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT The U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Office (DOE/ORO) intends to award a sole source contract to the HUBZone small business concern, Haselwood Services & Manufacturing, Inc., Oliver Springs, Tennessee,  FAR Part 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.   The proposed NAICS code is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract is for technical expertise and administrative support to assist the Assistant Manager for Nuclear Fuel Supply in the oversight of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) operation of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) as stated in Article 2 of the â€œAgreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and USEC, Inc.,â€ dated June 17, 2002.  The contractor will provide support to (1) assess USECâ€™s operation of the PGDP for production levels equal to or in excess of 3.5 Million Separative Work Units (3.5 MM SWU) per year and that the PGDP is capable of operating at 5.5 MM SWU per year at the required product assay, and ensure that a minimum of 150 cells are capable of operation, and (2) oversight of the cascade cells, cooling towers, pipelines to cooling towers, switch yards, seal shop, Freon supply, barrier, spare parts, spare materials, and general maintenance, and ensure that all critical systems, minimum of 34, are capable of performing their intended function.  Other areas may be monitored as requested by DOE. Haselwood Services & Manufacturing, Inc., is considered to be the only HUBZone small business concern that can perform this requirement, based on current market research.  This contractor has provided the required technical expertise and administrative support for a number of years and its personnel possess the knowledge base and experience to perform the required oversight of USEC operation of the PGDP.  The PGDP utilizes a complex technology which involves a diversity of processes.  In order to assess USECâ€™s operation of the PGDP for production levels equal to or in excess of 3.5 MM SWU per year and the capability of the PGDP to operate at 5.5 MM SWU per year at the required product assay, technical expertise and a broad overall knowledge of plant operation and production processes is required in many different engineering and management disciplines.  The compacted time frames required for delivery of the products of this effort require that the project be staffed with knowledgeable personnel with the experience and capability to understand overall plant operation, the DOE mission, and the existing regulatory framework. Any HUBZone firm who wants to challenge the proposed sole-source award must submit an interest letter that demonstrates its ability to provide an equivalent service as described above, and rationale why they should be considered.  All interest letters must be received by 8:00 AM April 8, 2005, via email to ahlersdd@oro.doe.gov or via facsimile to (865) 241-2549.  It is the firmâ€™s responsibility to confirm DOE receipt of its interest letter. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract award based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No reimbursement of any costs associated with providing this capability information will be provided by DOE.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with the New England Aquarium Central Wharf to maintain and curate the North Atlantic Right Whale photo-identification catalog.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. The North Atlantic Right Whale Catalog, which physically exists at the New England Aquarium, is the foundation of much of the assessment and other research and management activities on this critically endangered population.  Although the Catalog covers submissions of photographs and associated data from all right whale biologists in the North Atlantic, it was established by the New England Aquarium and this institution has always housed it and has been responsible for its curation.  In order to facilitate analysis and management of this endangered species, it is not feasible for any other institution to catalog this data into any other database but where all the other data on this species currently resides.  Since this unique repository of data exists in only one place, it not possible for any other institution to perform the required work under the proposed contract.   This requirement shall include cataloguing and archiving of submitted photographs, as well as digital image scanning of existing and new photographs.  The principal objectives of the task are to curate the existing collection of right whale photographs in the catalog; accession into the catalog all new photographs; match new photographs with the existing catalog to identify previously sighted and new individuals; archive all associated sighting data; and submit a matching report to photo contributors as soon as matching is completed.  The period of performance shall be from May 1, 2005 through April 30, 2006.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by April 7, 2005.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<CONTACT>Hilda L. Flores, Contracting Officer, 210-977-5485
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the Air Force's intent to award a sole source contract for the installation and on-site administration of the automated CCaRS to include the associated technical, functional and logistical support for the implementation and use of CCaRS.  The contract will be awarded to Integrated Data Services (IDS), 300 N. Continental Blvd., Ste 200, El Segundo CA  90245-5043.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  CCaRS is a proprietary solution for automating the financial processes of Air Force organizations.  It is an enterprise financial management tool design that supports a number of key facets of financial/program management.  IDS owns the CCaRS source code and it is the sole property of IDS.  The system has been in successful operation and is currently supporting numerous AFMC organizations across the country, including the Electronic Systems Center (ESC) at Hanscom AFB.  A geographic separated unit (GSU) of ESC, the Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), must use CCaRS to maintain system integrity and ensure the data interfaces properly resulting in more efficient, more accurate financial transactions. The system is deeply ingrained into the corporate business culture and processes, and is the cornerstone for conducting day-to-day business.  A five year requirements contract is being solicited with a one-year basic period and 4-12-month option periods are anticipated for award.     Note 22 applies.  See Note 26.

<DESC>Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services 
The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services related to the modernization and renovation at the Birch Bayh Federal Building in Indianapolis, IN.  The Birch Bayh was built in 1905 and a major addition was added to in 1938. It was originally designed as a four-story U-shaped building with the legs of the “U” facing north into the city mall.  The building originally housed the U.S. Post Office and other offices in addition to the U.S. Courts.  The building was placed on the National Historic Register in 1974.  Therefore, the design and construction shall comply with the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act (NPHA). The building consists of a partial sub-basement, a basement, a first floor, which covers the entire building footprint, donut-shaped 2nd through 4th floors, and a linear 5th floor which runs along the north side of the building.  The exterior of the building has an imposing limestone-faced façade that reflects the developing governmental style of architecture of the period.  The estimated construction cost range is $25 million to $40 million. 
The scope of the CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-Construction Phase Services and a unilateral option for Construction Phase Services.

A firm, fixed-price based upon the general construction services required will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction Phase Option.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Source Selection Procedures (FAR 15.3).  For this procurement, technical factors when combined are more important than cost or price. 
Project Summary: The project shall be executed based on design and construction excellence, and shall include the following work: Asbestos abatement, roof replacement, restroom upgrades, exterior windows restoration and new storm windows installation, storage areas renovation to be used as swing space, HVAC replacement, plumbing and fire protection replacement, temperature controls replacement and systems balancing, fire alarm system and sprinkler upgrades, replacing of ceiling lights and controls and improvements to the electrical distribution system.

All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitation.  As part of the CMc Pre-Construction Phase Services (Base contract & Option 1), the CMc shall work with the A E, the Third Party Commissioning Contractor, and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. For the Pre-Construction portion of this contract, GSA intends to have the contractor perform services such as: evaluation of design concepts, reviewing designs,  evaluating cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, reviewing phasing of work, resolving problems, participating in Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews, development of subcontactor and supplier interest, identification of long-lead items, and performing administrative and other services as defined in his scope of work. The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, necessary actions, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting. The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. 
Construction Phase Services (Option 2), of this project shall include, but may not be limited to, administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc’s internal personnel or under sub-contract), coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, record keeping, progress reporting, schedule control, inspections, testing, and other required supplemental LEED services. The CMc shall work with the A-E, the Third Party Commissioning Contractor and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.

Proposal Submission Requirements:  Proposals will be evaluated using the Source Selection “Best Value Trade-Off Process” FAR 15.101-1.  Offerors must submit information addressing the technical evaluation factors identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP) that will be evaluated by the Source Selection Board.  With a competitive range established, the most qualified firms will then be invited to deliver an oral presentation that will take place in Chicago, IL.

The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a quality Design-Build Services contractor for Air Handling System Improvements IMO23990 at Federal Building No. 2, Bannister Complex, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri, 64131, Solicitation Number GS06P05GZC0011.  The contractor selected will be responsible for taking the scope and performance documents prepared by an architect/engineer through design and construction.  The estimated cost of design and construction for the design-build contract is between $4,000,000 and $8,000,000.  The contract length shall be proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Government, but shall not exceed 24 months 730 calendar days after Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about September 16, 2005.  This procurement will be completed using a two-step source selection process. This contract is restricted only to those firms having an existing design, construction and/or design/build contracting office within the bi-state Kansas City region defined by the Mid-America Regional Council MARC as the Kansas counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray. Such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this announcement.   Federal Building No. 2 of the Bannister Complex, which was built in 1942, has 197,410 usable square feet of office space. It consists of a basement and two levels above ground and has approximately 1,535 employees. The fan houses and air distribution equipment were added to the building around 1960.  The HVAC system consists of air handling units in fan houses located on the roof that distribute air to a major portion of the building, plus packaged air handling units that serve spaces with special needs and/or spaces mostly in the basement that were lacking in airflow from the fan house system.  The existing overall HVAC system is not energy efficient due to the use of old, inefficient equipment and the use of smaller, low efficiency, packaged units.  The existing fan house systems are in need of repair and renovation.  The supply and return fans and motors for the fan house air handling units are inefficient and inadequate in capacity to meet the airflow and static pressure requirements of the system.  The existing configuration of supply air ducts does not provide good air distribution to the entire building since not enough air velocity is maintained to force the air to the end of the system.  The scope of work includes the following: 1. Installation of five 5 new roof-top variable air volume, direct digital control, air-handling units to replace existing units. System should be equipped with a fixed supply-air temperature.  2. Removal of all penthouse fan equipment and modification of ductwork to accommodate new roof-mounted packaged air handling equipment. 3. Sealing of all chase penetrations and openings; relocating any obstructions to airflow in the chases; installing fire dampers and access panels; installing fire-rated enclosures; and replacing control valves, steam traps, strainers and roll filter media in the fan house units. Addition of medium-pressure ductwork in existing vertical chases. 4. Replacement of all existing horizontal supply ductwork on the roof with new ductwork. 5. Provision of outside air to existing packaged units located throughout the building. 6. Relocation of existing ground level air intakes to the roof. 7. Removal of existing air handling units in basement and on first floor and connection of areas served to building distribution system.  8. Replacement of outdoor air damper and actuator.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed after regular business hours.  The request for proposals RFP solicitation will be issued on or about April 12, 2005.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution FEDTeDS.  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch 6PCA, will no longer mail hardcopies of the solicitation and amendments.  The solicitation specifications and it’s amendments will only be available through a link in www.fedbizopps.gov to the Federal Technical Data Solution FEDTeDS website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR www.ccr.gov and then with FEDTeDS www.fedteds.gov.  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry www.fedbizopps.gov but the sensitive but unclassified acquisitions related information specifications will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  Offerors are responsible for producing their own print sets for their own use.  A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on or about April 28, 2005 at the GSA Office, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri.  GSA will receive proposals on or about May 12, 2005.  Date and time will be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal will be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will use the tradeoff process method of evaluation in selecting the prime contractor.  This concept is a method of evaluating technical factors and price, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage One will be technical evaluations of proposals to establish those who are most technically qualified.  Stage Two will be receipt of pricing and scheduling. Stage One technical proposals will be evaluated using the following technical factors, in descending order of importance:  1. Past performance of the firm; 2. Experience and qualifications of key personnel; 3. Management plan; and 4. Team composition, organization and prior experience as a design-build team.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the best value, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  This is a negotiated procurement that will result in a firm-fixed price contract.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval. Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established subcontracting goals of 39% total for Small Business SB, which includes 6% for Small Disadvantaged Business SDB; 5% for Woman-Owned Small Business WOSB, 3% for Hub Zone Small Business; HZSB; 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business VOSB; and 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business SDVOSB.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  Contact Mike Flanigan, Contract Specialist, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4912 or fax him at 816-926-3517.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Jean Dodd, at 816-926-1174.

<SUBJECT>A--Board Agency Announcement for the Department of Navy Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Demonstration Project
<SOLNBR>N0016705BAA08
<ARCHDATE>03242006
<CONTACT>Lynn Rowe 301-227-1100 Douglas M. Smith,Contracting Officer
<DESC>INTRODUCTION:  All sources, including traditionally non-defense commercial business entities and academia, are invited to submit proposals to assist DON in demonstrating and validating innovative concepts and technologies to reduce operating and maintenance costs, improve operational readiness, and reduce mishap risks associated with Navy and Marine Corps flight operations through the collection, download, storage, management, analysis, distribution and presentation/visualization of flight data.  Proposed concepts should include technologies and/or processes sufficiently mature to begin near-term operational demonstrations within one to six months of contract award.  The initial concept demonstration and assessment will last for approximately 12 months; however, the Government may elect to extend the demonstration beyond 12 months to refine concepts if warranted by data and user feedback collected, and offerors should include an approach for such a possibility in their!  proposals.  A final product from this solicitation will be a utility assessment based on the operational demonstration.  The proposed concepts received from this BAA and the corresponding results of the DON MFOQA Demonstration Project are expected to support the future acquisition of MFOQA technology by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) PMA-209, Air Combat Electronics. BACKGROUND:  Minimizing operational costs and reducing mishaps are essential to achieving improved operational readiness within the DON aviation community.  Lessons learned during the development and implementation of commercial Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) programs have indicated the potential for a high return-on-investment from proper flight data collection and analysis, which allows operators to achieve operating/maintenance cost reductions and improved safety.  Based on the benefits attained from commercial FOQA programs, DON has recognized the potential safety and operational efficiency improvements from a similar concept tailored to Naval aviation, referred to as Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA).  MFOQA is a knowledge management process in which flight performance and aircraft systems/maintenance data are collected, downloaded, analyzed and visualized in a Windows-based environment for use by the operator to improve operational readi! ness.  The goal of MFOQA is to provide quantifiable information in an intuitive form that operators, including individual aircrew as well as squadron/Fleet leadership, can use with minimal training to assess flight crew and aircraft system performance to identify and proactively address unfavorable trends and/or performance pertinent to aircrew training, aircraft maintenance, flight operations and safety.     DON MFOQA DEMONSTRATION:  DON is conducting a multi-phased MFOQA operational demonstration to validate the potential benefits in improved readiness and mishap reduction through routine analysis and visualization of aircraft systems and aircrew performance flight data.  The approach for the demonstration incorporates a spiral development process and rapid fielding of a limited solution with emphasis on operational settings and Fleet-user involvement.  The demonstration is tailored to specific aircraft type/model/series, units and missions, with the focus on software-based solutions.  Both fixed-wing (F/A-18C/D) and rotary-wing (SH-60B) aircraft demonstrations will be conducted and other demonstration platforms are also being considered (e.g., V-22, T-45, H-53, AV-8, F/A-18E/F, MH-60R/S).  In addition to the limited MFOQA capability currently within DON, there is interest in assessing and validating new technologies and concepts that can expand existent MFOQA capability to fur! ther demonstrate the potential benefits to Naval aviation from this knowledge management process.  DON will integrate MFOQA-related concepts selected via this BAA into a single operational demonstration, and will support the further development and validation of those concepts assessed to best satisfy future DON MFOQA requirements.   SUBMISSION OF PROPOSAL: This Broad Agency Announcement shall be effective from date of publication through one (1) year of the demonstration project.   However, for consideration of initial MFOQA Demonstration funding, proposals shall be received not later than June 7, 2005. PROPOSAL CONTENT: Each proposal must stand-alone and will be evaluated on its own merit.  A proposal shall consist of: 1. ONE-PAGE SYNOPSIS that includes a short title of the proposal; the offeror’s name/address/point of contact/telephone/fax/Internet address; brief narrative description including expected technical data deliverables, relevant goals/objectives of offer, and other information germane to the proposal; potential benefits (including projected cost savings) of technology and/or process proposed; and suitability of the proposed concept to be included in a near-term operational demonstration.  2. COST BREAKDOWN, to include both an initial 12-month demonstration and assessment as well as sustaining engineering support to extend the operational demonstration.  The cost breakdown should be sufficient for contract award and to allow the Government to modify the scope of the effort to be consistent with available funding.  A cost summary  (with Excel spreadsheet in elec! tronic format) shall be submitted.  3. UP TO 35 PAGES OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, including, but not limited to:  (1) Detailed description of the proposed technology and/or process (including text plus diagrams and photos as applicable); (2) Evidence of proven commercial or Government application, when applicable; (3) Technical approach, to include timeline and flexibility, and technical data deliverables, for proposed concept; (4) Potential for reducing operating/maintenance costs and/or improving safety in operations and/or training, and a proposed approach to evaluate the military utility within the operational demonstration that includes proposed metrics for validating benefits specifically to aircraft maintenance, operations, training and/or safety; (5) Ability to integrate with existing DON aircraft systems, personnel and processes; (6) Operator/maintainer training required to utilize the technology and/or implement the proposed concept; (7) Concept of Operations (CONOP! S) and required logistics support, including that required for a demonstration at an operational squadron as well as to sustain a residual capability following conclusion of the demonstration; (8) A draft Statement of Work (SOW) for possible incorporation as an attachment to a resulting contract or agreement award that clearly details the scope and objectives of the proposed effort, without any proprietary restrictions, and identifies separate optional task areas; (9) A summary of any proprietary rights to pre-existing results, prototypes, or systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of the proposed technology and/or process and how these rights impact the offeror’s ability to achieve the goals/objectives stated in the proposal, or, if there are no claims of proprietary rights, a statement to that effect; (10) Relevant experience of key personnel and submitting organization, capability of facilities, etc.  Items 8-10 can be included as attachments and are not included ! in the page count above. The scope of this BAA encompasses all areas of MFOQA for DON aircraft platforms including the areas of maintenance, operations, safety and training.  Emphasis is on concepts that can begin demonstration quickly and that utilize existing aircraft data sources and do not involve the addition of on-aircraft hardware or software and that can be automated to an extent that little or no additional burden is added to operational personnel.  Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (a) automated methods for flight data analysis to detect significant events, anomalies and trends (e.g., data mining, data fusion and data visualization); (b) techniques to discern/predict human factors or external factors indirectly from recorded flight data (e.g., crew work load, crew focus, environmental and other flight hazards.); (c) data/information presentation techniques that maximize understanding of complex data; (d) data architectures (both hardware and softwa! re) to automatically collect, sort and distribute data and information within various elements of an operational squadron (over LAN) as well as to higher levels in the command and support infrastructure (over WAN) that address database/data warehouse/data security concerns; (e) data storage/archival/retrieval capabilities; (f) dissemination and sharing of collected data and analysis products (e.g., electronic dissemination, server-client architectures, online query capabilities, etc.); (g)  open architecture  technologies or generic concepts that improve efficiency across disparate platforms; (h) technologies/approaches that are specific to a given operational environment or aircraft (e.g., F-18, H-60, V-22, T-45, H-53, AV-8, shipboard or land-based,  including detached operations); and (i) in-flight data collection and download technologies (real-time or post-flight). PROPOSAL FORMAT AND SUBMISSION: Proposals shall be on 8.5 x 11 inch paper, printed on one side of sequentially numbered pages, utilizing Times New Roman font no smaller than 11 point (10 point for graphics and charts); line spacing shall be at the discretion of the offeror.

<CONTACT>Annette deSercey  850-235-5483 , , or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Panama City, FL intends to issue a Purchase Order to Saunders Yachtworks, 27075 Marina Road, Orange Beach, AL 36561 on a sole-source basis for the salvage of components from a recently wrecked 24 foot Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB), installation of those components onto another RHIB, and the performance of all work necessary to update this hull and one additional hull to the configuration established under contract N61331-00-C-0043. Saunders Yachtworks was competitively selected to perform the prototype design and installation of the new engine and drive train (Cummins BT5.9M1, Twin Disc MG-507 transmission, and Konrad 520 Outdrive). Saunders Yachtworks was subsequently awarded contract N61331-00-D-0043 to upgrade the configuration of 13 additional RHIB to the new engine and drive train configuration. The government did not procure a drawing package defining the work required to complete this conversion during the prot! otype stage. Based on the government's review of the cost to obtain a competitive technical data package suitable for competition of the subsequent conversion, contract N61331-00-D-0043 was awarded on a sole source basis. This situation has not changed, as the government still does not have a technical data package. Only Saunders Yachtworks has the necessary technical data to perform the work required to upgrade the configuration of the two RHIB to the new engine and drive train configuration required. This action will result in one fully configured RHIB, including the engine and drive train installed, and one RHIB converted to accept the new engine and drive train, but without the engine and drive train installed. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>USDA-Forest Service, North Central Research Station (NCRS) seeks an engineering and architectural feasibility study for the NCRS headquarters building located on the University of Minnesota St. Paul campus. North Central Research Station is scheduled to repair or replace two major failing components of the headquarters facility in the near future: 1. Perimeter windowed curtain wall system, and 2. Perimeter steam heating system. 

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Firms/Lead Investigators interested in contracting for this work.  The A-E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project implementation.  The Lead Investigator is the individual or the team who will have primary responsibility to develop, conduct, and report the feasibility study.  

PERIMETER WINDOWED CURTAIN WALL SYSTEM.  

The headquarters building of the NCRS was constructed in the early 1960’s.  The building is approximately 50,000 square feet in size and consists of two towers, (north tower and south).  The north tower is made up of five stories.  An elevator penthouse sits atop the roof.  The south tower is built into the side of a hill and is made up of three stories.  The air handler penthouse sits atop the south tower.  The building is a reinforced concrete column, beam, and structural floor panel system with concrete spandrels along the perimeter.

The building exterior envelope consists of horizontal strip windows between each floor, a vertical curtain wall system composed of insulated metal panels and brick panels, and aluminum fins parallel to each window jamb running from grade to the roof.  The window system visually appears to be a curtain wall system, but in fact the curtain wall framing does not provide any structural support of the windows.  The curtain wall only provides a visual “ribbed” appearance to the building.

All indications are that the building exterior started leaking within the first year of occupancy.  Various attempts to mitigate the leaks have been attempted over the years including: caulking between the curtain wall panels, caulking the seams of the architectural “fins”, caulking between the fins and the panels, and installing new weather stripping in the windows.  None of these attempts to mitigate the leaks has had any prolonged effect.  Leaks occur on all sides of the building, usually after a significant rainstorm accompanied by winds strong enough to drive the rain in a horizontal direction.  The water usually saturates the area over and along the sides of the exterior windows resulting in loose plaster and water puddles on the floor.

PERIMETER STEAM HEATING SYSTEM.  

The pneumatically controlled perimeter heating system is powered by steam purchased from the University of Minnesota centralized steam plant.  The steam enters the building underground, into the second floor mechanical room.  The steam is reduced through a 50 lb steam manifold and then through a 10 lb manifold.  The 10 lb manifold distributes steam into 23 perimeter heating zones and up to the air handler penthouse.  Pneumatic air operates a thermostatically controlled steam valve for each steam zone.  Thermostatic traps are located at each terminal unit; terminal units being mostly radiators along with a few unit heaters.  Elsewhere throughout the building, float and thermostatic traps are mostly used on condensate drip legs.

The perimeter heating system requires a lot of time and expense to maintain.  Besides the fact that steam traps have to be checked each year and occasionally fail, we are finding that the condensate lines are also failing.  The condensate return piping (after the steam traps on terminal units) is in various stages of either plugging up or the walls are getting so thin that they rupture and leak.

BUILDING USE.  

Originally, the building had a dual use.  The north tower and the hallways connecting the towers have always been used as administrative space.  The south tower contained a number of wet chemistry laboratories and associated office space for scientists and technicians.  Over the years, the building has undergone a number of renovations.  There is only one true wet chemistry laboratory with a fume hood left.  All the other spaces have been converted to office space or some sort of utility space.  All but the one fume hood has been removed.

We are currently in the midst of consolidating employees to national facilities; meaning that not all of the existing space will be utilized.  This was not for-seen when project funding was approved.

BUILDING HISTORY.        

A cooling tower was originally used for ventilation cooling.  In the mid-1980’s the cooling tower was replaced with two York, 50-ton, rooftop chillers.  The University of Minnesota is in the process of constructing a centralized chilled water plant.  A study was commissioned in 2003 to determine the cost effectiveness of connecting to the new chilled water system vs. replacing the rooftop chillers.  Cost-wise, it is literally a wash.  However, not having the equipment to be concerned with nor having to keep staff around to maintain that equipment pushes the decision towards connecting to the centralized chilled water plant.  The rooftop chillers would then be eliminated.

In the early 1990’s, a direct digital control energy management system was installed in the building.  The energy management system was used to control the building ventilation.  Most of the control actuators remain pneumatic.

The original air handling units were constant volume units with steam pre-heat coils and steam re-heat coils.  Temperature controls were pneumatic.  Air handling unit #1 supplies six ventilation zones in the north tower and air handling unit #2 supplies eight ventilation zones to the connecting corridors and the south tower.  The towers and corridor return air to their respective air handling units.  In 2001, the air handling units were replaced with modular Trane units.  A steam to hot water converter was installed in the penthouse to serve ventilation pre-heat and re-heat coils.  The temperature controls were converted to a complete electronic system controlled by the building energy management system.

SERVICES.  

The steady deterioration of the condensate lines in the heating system along with the continual moisture problems due to the curtain wall system has prompted the Forest Service to determine what course of action(s) might be taken in order to deal with these problems.  The services requested in this feasibility study is to investigate, evaluate, and report the deficiencies in the curtain wall system and the perimeter steam heating system and propose alternatives to solve or deal with these deficiencies.
 
SELECTION PROCESS.  

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Firms/Lead Investigators interested in contracting for this work.  The A-E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project implementation.  The Lead Investigator is the individual or the team who will have primary responsibility to develop, conduct, and report the feasibility study.

The A-E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: 

Stage I:	Interested firms will submit a completed Standard Form 330 Architect-Engineer Qualification to establish a short-list (minimum of three A-E Firms) of firms with the qualifications to accomplish this project.

Stage II:	Qualified A-E Firms will submit proposals to accomplish the feasibility study.


Stage I: The first stage will establish the capabilities of the A-E Firm/Lead Investigator.  Capability to perform the investigation will be based upon the following criteria as provided in the SF 330.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS,intends to negotiate with Research Foundation CUNY, New York, NY, under the CREST Program on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 ( c ) (1), only one responsible source.  The CREST Program is a collaboration of Universities in the NYC metropolitan  area including CUNY, New York, directed in part at Minorities, for the continued study of Compression of AIRS Data Using Empirical Mode Decomposition. Future satellite platforms will include hyper spectral sensors to monitor the Earth’s environment. Hyper spectral sensors will greatly improve the accuracy of key parameters, such as atmospheric temperature, moisture, ozone, and land and ocean surface properties. Improved accuracy of the parameters will significantly improve our capability to monitor the current state of the environment and to improve predicted of changes in both weather and climate. Improvements in these key parameters are derived by measuring the Earth’s outgoing radiation as much fined spectral and spatial resolution. The AIRS data from the NASA AQUA platform will be used to test different techniques. This task calls for the study of the application of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to the compression of 3D hyper spectral sounding data. The EMD approach will be test using 3D  AIRS data. AIRS data includes 2108 infrared channels and arranged in granules that consist of 135 scan lines containing 90 cross-track footprints per scan line resulting in total 135 x 90 footprints.  TASKS: 1) Develop a (vector quantization) algorithm for classification of different types of footprints in 3D granule. 2) Modify IMF decomposition process to make it suitable for AIRS data type. 3) Develop software based on the proposed algorithm for 3D AIRS data compression (make it available to all members of AIRS data compression group) 4) Participate in comparative performance study of the proposed algorithm versus existing compression algorithms. 5) Participate in Data Compression Conferences and Workshops. 6) Involve students in the project to train them for possible future activities. 

Offerors certain they can meet the requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis.
 
All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the attention of Sally Huber, Contract Specialist. Note 22  applies.

<DESC>Philadelphia Division, Contacting Department, FISC Norfolk will be hosting a pre-solicitation conference on Thursday, 08 April 2004 during the hours of 0830 to 1200 at the Washington Naval Yard, Washington, D.C., Bldg 220 Auditorium.  The purpose of this pre-solicitation conference is to explore and solicit innovative concepts that would improve the Navy Planning and Programming Processes in support of the Deputy Chief of Naval operations (Resources, Requirements & Assessments)(N8), Department of the Navy (DoN).  N8 has an ongoing responsibility to maintain and administer resource allocation processes with a specific focus on building and defending the Navy Program Objective Memorandum (POM), Program Review, and related programming and budgeting products.  This effort requires the development of a process that is capable of creating near and long-term strategies that influence the investment alternatives that support Naval Warfighting Objectives.  The process must be repeatable, analytically based, and capable of identifying a range of alternative approaches to meeting corporate objectives within fiscal constraints.  In order to increase the overall fidelity of the Navy Program build and to create a program that has enduring qualities beyond the immediate Future Year Defense Plan, the Navy is interested in exploring the state of what is possible with respect to Navy programming from those firms that possess a clear and demonstrable record of accomplishment of participation in strategic planning, risk assessment and programming at a level comparable to an Echelon I Navy activity.   The pre-solicitation conference will provide an overview of the Navy objectives as well as provide for an open forum to discuss and exchange contractor responses to these objectives.  The results of these explorations, as obtained during the pre-solicitation conference, will result in the issuance of a formal Request For Proposal (RFP) requiring the submission of technical and price/cost proposals.  The evaluation of proposals will consider the offeror’s technical proposal to be significantly more important than the offeror’s price/cost proposal.  Initial focus of the technical evaluation conducted under the formal RFP will be on identifying offerors’ demonstrable corporate expertise and capability in this type of project, as well as offerors’ ability to provide examples where a process improvement was proposed, implemented and had significant Return On Investment (ROI) from a previous consulting engagement.  It is paramount that offerors interested in participating in the Pre-Solicitation Conference and responding to the resultant formal RFP possess tangible, relevant and timely experience in business process re-engineering and strategic planning efforts with an organization comparable to the United States Navy.    Preparatory materials and directions will be sent to all attendees prior to the pre-solicitation conference.  Contractors interested in attending the pre-solicitation conference should contact Dot Lakota via e-mail at Dorothy.Lakota@navy.mil no later than Friday, 08 April 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this  time.    This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research  purposes only.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources  capable of meeting the requirements for providing a Consolidated Healthcare  Asset Management Program (CHAMP).  A proposed draft Performance Work Statement  and Air Force Material Command Services Capability Package are attached to  provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the Air Force  Material Command and the respondent’s potential ability to meet the  Government’s requirements. The medical equipment and real property maintenance support includes, but is  not limited to the maintenance (scheduled and unscheduled) necessary to keep  medical facilities and biomedical equipment at nine (9) Medical Treatment  Facility (MTF) locations in good working order.

The objective of the CHAMP is to reduce equipment maintenance  expenditures and provide a fixed annual budget.  This program will replace  manufacturer and third party service contracts with a comprehensive management  services program that combines the cost control protection of service  contracts with administrative and technical expertise.  The Air Force anticipates utilizing an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity  contract for this award. The period of performance for this effort is expected  to be one base year with four one-year option periods.   All respondents are required to certify if they currently meet the small  business requirements under the North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS) code 561210 Facilities Support Services, $30M, as of the date of their  proposal submittal. This requirement is a set aside for those contractors that  meet the small business NAICS 561210 certification requirement on the date of  contract award, not when they last renewed their GSA Contract.  All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly  demonstrates capabilities and expertise related to this effort.  The  capabilities package requirements are to be presented in accordance with the  attachments entitled *Capabilities Package For AFMC Support Services.  Your  package should demonstrate capabilities, expertise and past performance  relevant to the requirements cited above.

No facsimile responses will be accepted.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this  synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with  preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not  constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does this issuance restrict the  Government’s acquisition approach.  The Government reserves the right to  reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this  announcement.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part  of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and  present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative is a collaborative effort to harness the power of information technologies to modernize structured learning.  It sets forth a new paradigm to provide access to the highest quality education and training that can be tailored to individual needs and delivered cost-effectively, whenever and wherever it is required.  The ADL Initiative employs a structured, adaptive, collaborative effort between the public and private sectors to develop the standards, tools, and learning content for the future-learning environment.

The ADL Initiative created a network of four ADL Co-Laboratories (ADL Co-Labs) to advance the initiative and to serve distinct areas of operational responsibility.  The ADL Co-Lab Network serves as the focal point and catalyst for the large-scale cooperative research, development, implementation and assessment of ADL technologies and related products.  As a member of that ADL Co-Lab Network, the Joint ADL Co-Lab integrates instruction and technology to meet the military’s training requirements.  It actively pursues research interests to advance the state of distributed learning within the Department of Defense.

PROGRAM SCOPE
The Joint ADL Co-Lab anticipates making multiple awards with the dollar amounts typically ranging from $100,000 to $400,000 for each award, although the Co-Lab reserves the right to make larger awards.  Offerors may propose on one or more research areas and offerors are encouraged to aggregate two or more research areas in one white paper solution.  The planned method for accomplishing the research in each prospective area is to utilize a phased approach.  Therefore, white papers submitted should be structured so that the technical approach/solution for the proposed research area(s) address a Basic Effort (Phase I) and one (1) priced Option Effort (Phase II).  The white paper needs to address at least one of the research areas listed in the BAA and must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.

PHASE I
Phase I will be no more than a 12-month effort and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 - $400,000 per research area, although the Co-Lab reserves the right to make larger awards.  The effort will culminate in an initial demonstration in the Joint ADL Co-Lab in the fall of 2006.

PHASE II
Phase II will be no more than a 12-month effort and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 - $400,000 per research area, although the Co-Lab reserves the right to make larger awards.  Final demonstration will be at the Joint ADL Co-Lab in the fall of 2007.

Each white paper must include a statement that the offeror agrees to:

a)	The formal exchange of technical information developed under this effort with Joint ADL Co-Lab personnel, subject to signed non-disclosure agreements and/or Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA),
b)	Participation in at least two mandatory technical interchange meetings with Joint ADL Co-Lab personnel, and 
c)	Provide the Joint ADL Co-Lab with Government Purpose Rights (GPR) in all technical data and non-commercial software developed under all efforts under awarded contracts.

WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION
Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the needs identified in this announcement may submit a white paper.  White paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received by the Joint ADL Co-Lab no later than 1500 EDT on 15 Apr 2005.  No extensions will be granted.  White papers must address requirements for both phases and shall not exceed 5 pages in length of computerized text at 12 pitch, excluding resumes and diagrams.  Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  All white papers must include Phase II as a priced option.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  A proposal will only be solicited from white papers deemed to best meet the program objectives.  

WHITE PAPER EVALUATION CRITERIA
White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:

1.	Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to one or more BAA topics.  The overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the offeror's technical approach through a comprehensive, logical, orderly, concise, phased plan that indicates major milestones, critical paths, key events, capabilities that can be spun off, demonstration articles, etc.  Consideration should be given to the extent which current State-of-the-Art technology is expanded.  Also, innovative teaming arrangements should be taken into consideration.  Offeror should discuss how their concept will be documented, demonstrated, or evaluated, and this discussion should be indicative of the understanding of what is required in this program.  

2.	Potential Contribution to Military Services Needs and Transition to other Programs: The offeror must adequately address how the proposed program will meet the goal of one or more BAA topics.  The proposal must show understanding of the potential alternative approaches and make a compelling case for the viability of the proposed effort.  The relevance is further indicated by the offeror's understanding of the operating environment of the product or demonstration (current Military or Industrial technical problems/issues, limitations, etc.).  The relationships of the proposed effort with other ongoing or anticipated initiatives (military or civilian) that are focused on improving Distributed Learning should be considered.  Offeror should recognize and identify potential strategies for transitioning technology within the DoD.  Plans on how offeror intends to get developed technology, and information on these developments, to the user community should be considered.  

3.	Corporate Capabilities and Facilities: Offerors are required to describe their relevant capabilities and accomplishments.  The offeror must have a demonstrated capability to conceptualize, develop theories, identify concept deficiencies, analyze, and develop mature concepts for rapid application/ demonstration.  Consider the offeror’s history of related work.  Also consider any unique facilities or equipment that the offeror possesses.

4.	Personnel: The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations should be examined and assessed for this effort.

5.	Cost: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be considered as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation should consider the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate and provide accounting of funds, equipment, and personnel, select subprojects, monitor and evaluate the program to achieve the proposed objectives, and respond to contingencies created by unanticipated technical barriers or breakthroughs.
  
White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of this announcement and deemed to best meet the program objectives may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  To be eligible for award a white paper must be submitted.  The Government intends to use non-government personnel of Alion Science and Technology located in Orlando, FL and Encomium located in Orlando, FL to assist in the evaluation of proposals.  Contractor personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose.  Contractor personnel are required to sign Conflict of Interest and Non-Disclosure Statements.  Offerors will be notified whether or not their white paper was favorably received on or about 06 May 2005.  Favorable review of a white paper does not constitute selection of the proposed effort for contract award and will not establish a binding commitment for the government to fund the effort in whole or in part.  Upon notification, the Government will issue a request for proposal letter with complete instructions for proposal preparation.  An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  If proposals are solicited, proposals are due no later than 1500 EDT on 01 June 2005.

This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to reimburse any proposal preparation cost for responding.  The cost of proposal preparation in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Any request for white paper or submission of a full proposal does not guarantee award.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time and shall not be liable for any cost of proposal preparation or submission.  Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement constitutes the Government’s solicitation for this effort.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  

WHITE PAPER FORMAT:  White papers shall not exceed 5 pages of computerized text at 12 pitch (excluding cost estimates and diagrams).  The white papers should be provided in both hardcopy and electronic form no later than EDT 1500 15 Apr 2005.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF AT LEAST (4) SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) DESIGN-BUILD/100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8(A), HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTOR. THE OTHER CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-05-R-0095.  The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for military installations serviced by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and also the ROICC Fort Worth, TX area of responsibility; however the Government reserves the right to award contracts under the Naval Facilities Engineering Command’s area of responsibility.  Task Orders may be issued as either Design-Build or 100% Plans and Specifications. The work will be at the following primary locations:  NAS Meridian, NCBC Gulfport, NS Pascagoula, Stennis Space Center, Keesler AFB, NAS/NSA New Orleans, Barksdale AFB, and NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas, and military installations in the ROICC Fort Worth, TX area of responsibility; however the Government reserves the right to award contracts under the Naval Facilities Engineering Command’s area of responsibility.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The total estimated value for all contracts will not exceed $350,000,000.  The anticipated construction cost of each task order is between $3,000,000 to $15,000,000 with the average project in the $3,000,000 - $10,000,000 range.  Some projects may include significantly developed designs.  If a minimum of two offerors remain in the pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS.  THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000; THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE FOUR WILL BE AWARDED THE SEED PROJECT THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TASK ORDER.  This procurement will include potential award for one 8(a) eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams), unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than seven (7) is in the Government’s interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design build contracting. The narrowing phase is based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor (one) that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8(a), HUBZONE, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  The successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract. In Phase II, a maximum of seven (7) Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals, unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than seven (7) is in the Government’s interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design build contracting. Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS.  THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000; THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE FOUR WILL BE AWARDED THE SEED PROJECT THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TASK ORDER. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation. The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 7 March 2005.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, with updates, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  The updates are (1) update the contracting POC in the body of the announcement and (2) update the technical areas of interest.

POC Dr. Barry T. McKinney, 315-330-3730, email: Barry.McKinney@rl.af.mil; Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 315-330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. AFRL, Rome Research Site is soliciting research white papers under the "Information Institute Research Program" Broad Agency Announcement BAA-01-08-IFKPA. Research areas of interest include innovative approaches, basic and exploratory research projects in the area of information science and technology. Information science and technology areas of interest include but are not limited to: Information Exploitation; Information Fusion & Understanding; Information Management including JBI & Collaborative Environments; Advanced Computing Architecture including Biocomputing & Quantum Computing; Cyber Operations, active & passive; Command & Control including Effects Based Operations & Decision Sciences; Connectivity including Integrated Transmission & Exploitation. Efforts that will be performed as part of the II research program are intended to be collaborative university efforts designed to provide AFRL/IF with leading edge research that can be applied to a variety of AFRL/IF & Air Force needs. Universities conducting research as part of the II are encouraged to work collaboratively with other institutions and to leverage on-going AFRL/IF research programs and activities. Additionally, AFRL/IF has an active Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions Program. Hence, research proposals from HBCU/MI may be funded from special funds set aside by the II Director. Supplemental information regarding each of the seven research areas is available upon request by e-mail from: Barry.McKinney@rl.af.mil. 

Command and Control/Gaming Environment:  We seek a range of cost-effective approaches to populate an experimentation environment with different "games" that span a spectrum from manual "board games" to highly automated Massive Multi-player Online Games (MMOGs) or Persistent Virtual Worlds.  The scope includes: Develop new or adapt an existing game engine (develop new only for the simple "board game" application; adopt/adapt existing MMOG/Persistent World games) and Automated games (servers), must run on an affordable infrastructure (e.g., high-end PC workstations) and operate over a typical internet connection, through firewalls. The focus will be on experimentation with cost-effective, interactive multi-player gaming environments that will serve as the centerpiece for stimulating the exploration of advanced Command & Control (C2) concepts and the innovative use of information technology in support of C2. 
Command & Control (C2) is the exercise of authority and direction by a commander over assigned forces in the accomplishment of a mission. Command and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures employed by the commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations.  The projected outcome of this initiative is to demonstrate the use of the gaming environment in facilitating C2 experimentation and technology evaluation.  The gaming environment will serve to create the context and dynamic stimulus for the functions of C2:  Planning, Directing, Coordinating and Controlling.  We encourage a multidisciplinary collaboration between industry and academia lead teams.  More detailed supplemental information can be obtained from the Technical POC Dr. Barry T. McKinney, 315-330-3730, email: Barry.McKinney@rl.af.mil. 

Principal funding for proposals selected from this announcement will begin in FY01. Each award is limited to approximately $100,000 to $300,000 in value with a duration of not more than thirty six (36) months. Total funding for this BAA is limited to $3M over the life of the BAA. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Large, small, woman-owned small, small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. 

Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a two (2) to three (3) page white paper on their proposed research topic to Dr. Barry McKinney, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome 13441-4514, Reference BAA-01-08-IFKPA. Offerors should indicate in their cover letter if they are a university, an HBCU or a not-for-profit business, or a large, small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned or veteran-owned business.  The white paper should be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, period of performance, cost of effort, and name of company, Section B: Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology. The purpose of this white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort of the part of an offeror whose work is not of interest under this BAA. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a proposal. Complete instructions on proposal preparation and submission will be forwarded with any proposal invitation. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

<SUBJECT>39 -- Request for Information (RFI) from Industry for a Submarine Launched Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (SLIRBM) Launcher Subsystem (SLS)!
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-GPO381249
<RESPDATE>042105
<ARCHDATE>05212005
<CONTACT>Thomas Heilig, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-764-1704, Fax 202-764-2162, Email SPN62@SSP.Navy.Mil
<DESC>17.1.	BACKGROUND:

SSP is assessing the feasibility of developing the Launcher subsystem necessary to support the SLIRBM mission.  SSP has developed baseline programmatic and technical information necessary to conceptualize the SLIRBM Launcher Subsystem (SLS).  SSP requires input from industry resources to refine their understanding of the technical feasibility, risk and cost implications associated with this effort.  Specifically, this RFI documents a Government request from industry for the preliminary conceptual design and rough order of magnitude cost information associated with SLS development and production.   
2.	DISCUSSION

2.1	The SLIRBM

The SLS shall be designed to accommodate multiple SLIRBMs within the SSGN missile tube.  Preliminary missile design information is available in the SLIRBM RFI Contractor Data Augmentation Request (RFI Solicitation Number 08252003-0358).  For purposes of design of the SLS, preliminary SLIRBM specifications are as follows: 

			Total Length = 32 ft ± 1 ft
			Missile Diameter = 31.5 in +1 in/-1.5 in
			Gross Lift-off Weight = 15,000 lbs

The development of the SLS is to include a four-year program for a sea-based (though not from a submarine) system demonstration/risk reduction flight test, with design and production to follow.  

2.2	Information Requested:  Provide conceptual technical information, comments and ROM cost assessments for the following items:

1.	Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and associated operational scenarios to be employed for SLS concepts.  Design should minimize required SSGN platform modifications for SLS integration.  Launch preparation, maintenance and downtime should be minimized.  Ability to launch the missile from a wide range of depths, speeds and sea conditions should be optimized, but design should emphasize a low-cost approach.  Minimizing cost of the SLS shall be a predominant programmatic consideration.  Ideas that limit CONOPS in favor of cost savings should be considered.

2.	Methods to mechanically support SLIRBMs in the SSGN missile tube (MT) including a discussion of the technical advantages and disadvantages of encapsulated missile (e.g., All-up-Round Canister) and bare missile (e.g., Trident D5 Launcher) concepts.

3.	Discussion of the expected trade space available for lateral/vertical support and retention and how this space may be impacted if two, three or four SLIRBMs are to be integrated in each SSGN MT.

4.	Mitigation of shock, minimization of vibration transmission and discussion of the proposed method for systems level shock qualification.

5.	Approaches for converting the SSGN to/from a SLIRBM strike configuration and replenishing (i.e., refurbishment and reload) fired weapons.  Responses should address potential trades that will facilitate reduced conversion/replenishment timelines.

6.	Release/eject mechanisms including a discussion of the feasibility of “cold gas” vs. traditional gas generator concepts.  Responses should emphasize “cold gas” launch as a potential lower life cycle cost alternative to an ordnance-based gas generator.  Discuss potential operational limitations (e.g launch depth) of a cold gas eject mechanism relative to gas generator.  CONOPS limitations that result in significant cost savings will be considered when finalizing an approach for missile eject.

7.	Methods for providing services to the missile including tube pressurization/environmental control, communications and power. Responses should be sure to address the technical feasibility of both wireless and wired (i.e., an umbilical cable) communications/power concepts.

8.	Closure design concepts including a discussion of the technical feasibility and cost implications associated with domed, flat, hard-shell and fly-through closure variations.

9.	Discussion of the challenges associated with the release/ejection, underwater trajectory and post-broach flight of a SLIRBM.  Include comments on feasible approaches for mitigation of adjacent launch affects and debris fallback.

10.	Design to Cost concept for an affordable design and life cycle support cost.

The response shall comment on requested design considerations.  Discuss items that are not clear or may be construed as overly restrictive.  If appropriate, recommend additional capabilities or considerations that may not have been documented in the RFI.  

Ensure that response adequately addresses the following:

a.	Description of concepts (Use drawings, diagrams, etc. as necessary).

b.	Technical advantages, disadvantages and perceived implementation risks associated with these concepts.

c.	ROM development costs for proposed, four-year demonstration program.

d.	If necessary, provide the rationale for concepts that may have been difficult to fit within the specified system architecture.

3.	STRUCTURE FOR RESPONSES

Contractors should respond to this RFI in writing and should provide their responses both in electronic and hardcopy form.  Limit response to a maximum of 150 pages.  One electronic copy of the response shall be provided in PDF format and must be received by the specified due date.  Contractors shall also submit five hardcopies to the Government.  The hardcopies must be typewritten on single-sided 8½” by 11” paper with one-inch margins on all sides and double-spaced text, and bound in standard binders.  Use 12-point font with normal (uncondensed) spacing.

4.	INFORMATION EXCHANGE MEETING

The Government reserves the right to arrange an Information Exchange Meeting(s).  These private sessions would provide a closed forum for individual contractors to share proprietary conceptual information with the Government. The exact format and date of these meetings has yet to be determined; however, the decision to hold an Information Exchange Meeting will be based on the number of requests to participate that are received. 

5.	LEGAL DISCLAIMER 

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be viewed as a request for procurement.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. The responses will not be considered offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for their expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

<DESC>This amended synopsis hereby corrects the date for the Pre-solicitation conference to Thursay, 14 April 2005, as noted below.   

Philadelphia Division, Contacting Department, FISC Norfolk will be hosting a pre-solicitation conference on Thursday, 14 April 2005 during the hours of 0830 to 1200 at the Washington Naval Yard, Washington, D.C., Bldg 220 Auditorium.  The purpose of this pre-solicitation conference is to explore and solicit innovative concepts that would improve the Navy Planning and Programming Processes in support of the Deputy Chief of Naval operations (Resources, Requirements & Assessments)(N8), Department of the Navy (DoN).  N8 has an ongoing responsibility to maintain and administer resource allocation processes with a specific focus on building and defending the Navy Program Objective Memorandum (POM), Program Review, and related programming and budgeting products.  This effort requires the development of a process that is capable of creating near and long-term strategies that influence the investment alternatives that support Naval Warfighting Objectives.  The process must be repeatable, analytically based, and capable of identifying a range of alternative approaches to meeting corporate objectives within fiscal constraints.  In order to increase the overall fidelity of the Navy Program build and to create a program that has enduring qualities beyond the immediate Future Year Defense Plan, the Navy is interested in exploring the state of what is possible with respect to Navy programming from those firms that possess a clear and demonstrable record of accomplishment of participation in strategic planning, risk assessment and programming at a level comparable to an Echelon I Navy activity.   The pre-solicitation conference will provide an overview of the Navy objectives as well as provide for an open forum to discuss and exchange contractor responses to these objectives.  The results of these explorations, as obtained during the pre-solicitation conference, will result in the issuance of a formal Request For Proposal (RFP) requiring the submission of technical and price/cost proposals.  The evaluation of proposals will consider the offeror’s technical proposal to be significantly more important than the offeror’s price/cost proposal.  Initial focus of the technical evaluation conducted under the formal RFP will be on identifying offerors’ demonstrable corporate expertise and capability in this type of project, as well as offerors’ ability to provide examples where a process improvement was proposed, implemented and had significant Return On Investment (ROI) from a previous consulting engagement.  It is paramount that offerors interested in participating in the Pre-Solicitation Conference and responding to the resultant formal RFP possess tangible, relevant and timely experience in business process re-engineering and strategic planning efforts with an organization comparable to the United States Navy.    Preparatory materials and directions will be sent to all attendees prior to the pre-solicitation conference.  Contractors interested in attending the pre-solicitation conference should contact Dot Lakota via e-mail at Dorothy.Lakota@navy.mil no later than Friday, 08 April 2005.

<DESC>This is the first modification to Solicitation W914NS-05-Q-0021.  This modification is to provide answers to questions posed by industry. 


QUESTION: Does the PCO/FAA intend to allow contractor personnel to become position certified, facility rated and allow enough time in all ATC facilities to become professionally comfortable before OJT is performed?

ANSWER: Yes, The Government expects the contractor’s employees to gain familiarity with facility operations within the first 30-day period.  The operation at the BIAP airport is VFR/Special VFR with operations averaging 175 per 10-hour day (4 operations per 15-minute period). All contractor employees should be well versed in these operations and should have had experience at airports with a far higher operations count.

QUESTION:  Does the reference to NLT 30 Days in SOW Paragraph 4.1 apply to OJT as well?

ANSWER: OJT shall begin NLT 30 days after the contractor arrives for duty at the facility.

QUESTION:  If the 6 month period is to be waived in lieu of an assumed 30 day period above, does the PCO/FAA intend the contractor to operate and manage the BIAP and other ATCT facilities within 30 days after award? 

ANSWER: Management of the various facilities will remain under GECA control. The contractor is expected to primarily provide OJT to student controllers and to secondarily provide effective management techniques to the GECA supervisors and management staff. 

QUESTION:  If the PCO/FAA does not allow the contractor to become position certified and facility rated prior to performance of OJT does the PCO/FAA intend to waive any requirements for OJT certifications or will OJT also be performed by position certified/facility rated individuals outside the contract? (i.e. USAF controllers?)

ANSWER: The Government presumes that the contractor’s employees will be capable of acquiring a level of proficiency suitable to perform OJT NLT 30 days after the contractor arrives on duty at the facility. No other persons outside the contract are expected to provide OJT.

.

QUESTION:   Has the PCO/FAA or MOT/GECA established procedures for ICAO Class 3 medical and psychological evaluations? 

ANSWER: MOT/GECA has an established medical certification program but no MOT/GECA orders exist to verify that ICAO SARPs have been appropriately followed.

QUESTION:  Has the PCO/FAA or MOT/GECA implemented an evaluation screening program and what standards besides ICAO Annex 1 are being used? (Age limits etc.)

ANSWER: MOT/GECA relies on the screening practices of the past thirty years. This is one of the many management controls must be brought into compliance with ICAO SARPS.

QUESTION:   Has the PCO/FAA conducted a formal ATC training needs assessment and if so is the needs assessment available for review?

ANSWER: The FAA has been overseeing the BIAP tower operation since July 4, 2004, seven days per week/10 hours per day. No formal assessment has been done but primary training needs have been identified: technical air traffic control English language proficiency, VFR operations, and weather observations (LAWRS).

QUESTION:  If an ATC training needs assessment has not been performed, will the PCO allow the contractor to perform an ATC training needs assessment?

ANSWER: It is imperative that the contractor in concert with MOT/GECA perform an ATC training needs assessment. This assessment should identify the needs within the current control environment, and future needs when hostilities cease and standard international airport operations become possible.

QUESTION:  Will FAAO 3120.4 AT Technical Training be required as the basis for the development of the Iraqi ATC Controller Certification Program?

ANSWER: MOT/GECA is committed to adopt and adapt FAA orders to the extent possible to resurrect their management control procedures. Adaptation of FAAO 3120.4 should be accomplished in concert with the MOT/GECA ATS Director and should be an incremental process: minimum immediately required procedures, followed by a mid-term adaptation and assessment, and then leading to a final long-term document.

QUESTION:  What level of authority and responsibility will the contractor have regarding certifications?  

ANSWER: None.  The authority for all certifications rests with MOT/GECA. The contractor is responsible for providing controller assessments and certification recommendations to MOT/GECA. FAA oversight will continue throughout this and other phases of the execution of the contract.

QUESTION:  What level of authority and responsibility will the contractor possess during OJT instruction of Iraqi ATC Supervisors and Managers?

ANSWER: The contractor will provide advice and recommendations to ATC Supervisors throughout the course of each operational day. Management techniques should be discussed with the ATS Director as needed. The authority and responsibility of the tower operation rests with the MOT/GECA ATC Supervisors. 

QUESTION:  Who is presently responsible for daily operations and management oversight of BIAP ATCT?

ANSWER: MOT/GECA is responsible for daily operations and management oversight of the tower with assistance of an FAA ATC Advisor.

QUESTION:  What relationship if any will the current BIAP ATCT management have with the contractor?

ANSWER: The MOT/GECA ATS Director will receive direct benefit of the activities of the contractor. The FAA will continue in its ATC Advisory role.

QUESTION:  Does the PCO/FAA intend to transfer all or any responsibility or authority to the contractor for operating and managing BIAP ATCT? 

ANSWER: There is no such intent.

QUESTION:    Does the PCO/FAA intend to provide for a “Phase-In” period of contractor air traffic controllers to take operational control and management of BIAP?

ANSWER: The phase-in period in limited to the contractor’s need to gain familiarity sufficient to provide OJT and management advice and consultation. 

QUESTION:  Does the PCO/FAA intend to contract the operations and management of the BIAP and other ATCTs in Iraq?

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION:  If the contractor is to provide ATC services at any time during the contract what are the expected rolls of contractor personnel and who will the contractor’s personnel report to at the ATCT facilities?

ANSWER: The Contractor’s Project Leader.

QUESTION:  If contractor personnel are required to provide ATC duties does the PCO intend to dedicate contractor personnel for ATC services and then dedicate other contractor personnel for training? 

ANSWER: No.


QUESTION:  Can the contractor employ US FAA certified controllers to perform the training or do they need to be ICAO certified?

ANSWER: The contractor may employ any properly certified and experienced personnel (including Us FAA certified controllers) so long as they are able to apply ICAO procedures.

QUESTION:  What is the time requirement, if any, for employing these personnel with regards to currency or past experience? (ATC experience within the last 6 months? etc.)

ANSWER: Currency of experience and past experience are obvious requirements for the successful execution of any ATC contract. Considering the minimal density of air traffic operations at BIAP, Basrah and other facilities, the contractor should employ the best available employees possible without further guidance from GECA/PCO/FAA.


QUESTION:  Does the PCO/FAA intend to allow enough time for the contractor to train and certify contractor’s personnel for all ATCTs in order to operate and manage the facilities and then become OJT instructor certified?

ANSWER: The initial 30 days should be enough for this to be accomplished with the proper personnel.


QUESTION:  Will all facility memorandums, operation plans, Letter of Agreements, and other necessary publications be available for review prior to submission of quotes?

ANSWER:  No.


QUESTION: What minimum level of insurance will be required for the performance of this contract?

ANSWER:  Base Defense Act requirements.

QUESTION:  What level of actual ATC services performance by contractors is expected with the SOW as it is written?

ANSWER: OJT is the prime activity of this contract; actual ATC services beyond OJT will be rare.

<DESC>This is the third modification to Solicitation W914NS-05-Q-0021.  This modification is to provide answers to questions posed by industry. 



QUESTION: Reference SOW 1.3 – Regarding the 50 personnel, how many, if any, are fully qualified to work all of the tower positions without direct supervision? 

ANSWER:  Approximately 12.

QUESTION: Reference SOW 1.3 – Have all the personnel had ATC classroom training of some type? 

ANSWER:  All have had either refresher or primary ATC training in either Jordon or Singapore within the past 14 months.

QUESTION:   Reference SOW 1.5 & 1.6 – Do the mid-2005 time frames refer to equipment only, or is that the date when the facilities are expected to begin providing service. 

ANSWER: The Area Control Center is expected to start limited operation by mid-2005. Both the ACC and the radar approach control are subject to delay due to contractual or equipment problems.

QUESTION: Reference SOW 2.1 & 6.6 – What type of equipment, including simulators, if any, is currently available for training?  

ANSWER: There are no simulators currently available. It is expected that an ACC and (collocated) radar lab will be available by mid-2005.

QUESTION:  Reference SOW 2.3.16 – Please confirm that Baghdad and Basrah will have TRACON, and that Erbil, Mosul and Sulaymaniya are ATCT only.
 
ANSWER: This is correct although Basrah’s TRACON may be limited to airport arrival and departure service only.

<DESC>Research and Development Sources Sought
Advanced Materials, Manufacturing, and Testing Information Analysis Center (AMMTIAC)

This is a Sources Sought synopsis.  In accordance with FAR Part 5.205, Special Situations, FAR Part 10, Market Research, and FAR Part 35, Research and Development, this Sources Sought synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to determine qualified sources capable of providing Advanced Materials, Manufacturing and Testing Information Analysis Center (AMMTIAC) for the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC).  The Government intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract with a potential performance period of 8 years.  If the Primary requirement (as detailed below) can be filled, submit only one package in response to this sources sought.  If it is determined that this requirement will be done as two contracts, those responses shall be considered as interested in both parts, unless specifically annotated otherwise.  The Government prefers to award one contract (Primary Proposal); however, based upon responses, the Government may award two contracts if it's in the Government's best interest (Alternate Proposal).

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  

Information Analysis Center (IAC):  The Department of Defense (DoD) Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program operates in accordance with DoD 3200.14, Principles and Operational Parameters of the DoD Scientific and Technical Information Program, 13 May 1997.  DoD IACs function as specialized subject focal points and shall operate in accordance with all directives, instructions, regulations and military standards as appropriate.  Specific details regarding IACs can be found in DoD 3200.14.  This document may be accessed online at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/320014.htm.  Enclosure 5 of DoD 3200.14 provides a formal overview of the IAC program including the functions and responsibilities of IACs.  Each requirement listed under Background/New Requirement, below, has/will have the core operation of an IAC.

Technical Area Task (TAT):  Technical Area Tasks are not a part of the core funded amount on the contract, rather they are individual tasks funded by other government organizations and are based on need and availability of funds.  These TATs are defined in the contract as an estimated cost contract line item, are not funded and are referred to as maximum amount.  Individual Delivery Orders are awarded against the contract for the performance of each individual TAT.  The Government does not guarantee the issuance of any TAT against the contract.  Reference DoD 3200.14 for a more in-depth definition of the Technical Area Tasks.

<DESC>Provide training for nine (9) individuals in the state of Wyoming.  This training is designed to provide potential or current first line wildland fire supervisors the tools to build and lead highly functional crews.  The leadership curriculum is based on genuine leadership opportunities, which take place in the field. Formal classes on leadership theory and communication will be taught, just as they would be in a traditional class setting. Trainees will hike cross-country from a start to finish point while investigating and exploring group dynamics and leadership values and principles. There will be significant technical, navigation, and environmental challenges as participant leaders decide the best approach to meet group goals.  Instructors will play evolving roles as participants' knowledge, experience and abilities increase during this self-contained expedition. The participant group will take on increasing levels of personal and team responsibility for the technical, navigational and interpersonal aspects of the traveling course.   Instructors will provide structured briefing, debriefing, feedback, technical expertise, safety management, evaluation, classes and structure for participant leadership and followership opportunities.  Student participation in this training experience must meet the National Wildland Fire Coordination Group (NWCG) requirements for Fireline Leadership.  The training will also be used as an NWCG certification.   Projected Leadership Outcomes: Each participant is expected to develop the following practices, applying them to the immediate tasks on the expedition and discussing their continued application within their fire crews: "Develop the ability of individuals to operate successfully in a prolonged stressful environment, "Sensitize crew persons to inter-personal issues and how to deal with them (coping mechanisms), "Build tools for preventing, detecting, and correcting operational errors, "Create self-awareness in each individual to prepare them to interact under stress and possible conflict, "Hone briefing and communication skills "Encourage individuals to become good members of expeditions (follower-ship), "Develop leadership skills within each crew member, "Discuss and use situation-dependent decision making models,  "Demonstrate mastery of the wildland fire leadership values and principles.  Progress toward these outcomes will be monitored through individual verbal and written evaluation(s). Training Dates and Length: For this fireline leadership program, we are prepared to conduct a 6-day field expedition May timeframe.  If interested please notify Lori Krohn (307)775-6054 e-mail:  Lori_Krohn@blm.gov by March 31, 2005.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Common Test and Training Range Architecture (CTTRA)
<DESC>To enhance testing of advanced weapon systems and to support the size, scale, and scope of training identified in the Joint Vision, the Office of the Secretary of Defense sponsors a series of workshops to facilitate the modernization of Department of Defense test and training range capabilities.  Since April 1994, these Common Test and Training Range Architecture (CTTRA) workshops have provided invaluable technical and programmatic direction, improving interoperability and reuse among range systems, facilities, and simulations. The sixteenth CTTRA workshop will be held on 16 - 19 May 2005 in St Louis, MO.  This workshop will focus on prioritizing emerging Global Positioning System (GPS) based instrumentation capabilities for potential inclusion in current technology development efforts sponsored by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program, or within the Training Transformation initiative.  The results of the workshop will be incorporated into a long range GPS-based instrumentation investment roadmap.  The CTTRA is not directly related to any current contract requirements; therefore attendance will not be funded by the Government.  It will be necessary for each company to fund their participation in this workshop. For more information on the upcoming CTTRA XVI Workshop, visit the website at http://cweb.osd.mil/cttra.  The points of contact for the workshop are Ms. Dee Salazar-Beddard, (703) 681-4165 x 113, dee.salazar-beddard.ctr@osd.mil, and Mr. Vince Consentino, ((850) 883-3419, vincent.consentino@eglin.af.mil.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

The Program Officer in Ethiopia assists in the monitoring of the humanitarian situation and management of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (DCHA/OFDA) relief programs throughout Ethiopia.  Primary duties include reporting, developing strategies and plans, program development and management and coordination and collaboration with USAID/Ethiopia staff.  This position will be graded at the GS-13 level.

The position will be based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia where the incumbent will work out of the USAID Mission.  The incumbent will travel extensively throughout the country to assess, evaluate and monitor emergency conditions, particularly at OFDA project sites, and make recommendations for interventions.

The incumbent will report directly to OFDA’s Regional Coordinator (RC) for the East and Central Africa regional team.  In addition, s/he will keep the Regional Advisor (RA) for East Africa appraised of all major issues and maintain regular contact with the American Ambassador and Mission Director in Ethiopia.  S/he will work closely and collaboratively with OFDA’s Disaster Operations Specialist (DOS) for Ethiopia in Washington on all aspects of the portfolio.

Introduction

OFDA’s Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) plans and coordinates appropriate responses to disaster situations worldwide and manages disaster relief and rehabilitation programs to meet the needs of disaster victims.  DRM maintains effective working relationships with geographic bureaus and overseas organizations to coordinate appropriate short- and long-term responses.  DRM also develops, coordinates, implements and manages strategies for the application of science and technology to prevent, mitigate and prepare for a variety of natural and human-caused disasters.  DRM coordinates for joint assessments and technological interventions with geographic bureaus, other international donor organizations, United Nations (UN) agencies, private voluntary organizations (PVOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations (IOs).  This position is within DRM and by being based in the field, provides direct support to OFDA’s Washington offices.  Historically, Ethiopia has also been a key country for OFDA because of significant emergency humanitarian needs and field presence has been important in effectively managing the country program.
This position is field-based and requires the incumbent to work directly with OFDA’s Washington staff to monitor grants, liaise with partners, carry on dialogue with all stakeholders (USAID field staff, U.S. Embassy staff, UN colleagues, host-country government colleagues, international and local NGO staff and other relevant civil society members) to enhance OFDA programming in the country where the position is based.  Occasionally the incumbent will be called upon to work on regional issues in neighboring countries, on an as-needed basis and in coordination with the position’s relevant Principal Regional Advisor (PRA), in this case the one stationed in Nairobi, Kenya.

OBJECTIVE

 The Program Officer provides a critical on-the-ground link with OFDA’s implementing partners and serves as a point of coordination with other U.S. government programs.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The incumbent’s duties and responsibilities will include, but will not be limited to, the following:

Reporting
The incumbent will collect information and report regularly, through official cables and other means, on humanitarian-related issues such as the overall humanitarian situation and the ability of local communities, local organizations, the host government, relief agencies and donor countries to address that situation, whether natural or human-caused.  When political or military events affect humanitarian or relief efforts, the incumbent will report on those events only to the extent required to inform OFDA of their impact.  Reporting should also provide insights into the environment confronting the humanitarian community and identify numbers of affected people, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees and other vulnerable groups and the nature and cause of their vulnerabilities and capacities.  The incumbent will provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other observations that may impact humanitarian relief efforts.

In-Country Presence
The incumbent will serve as the principle contact point for DCHA/OFDA in Ethiopia and will maintain regular contact with the grantees as well as UN agencies, IOs and NGOs.  S/he will develop relationships with the local authorities, monitor policies regarding humanitarian assistance and relief organizations and meet with U.S. government personnel, Ethiopian governmental officials, other foreign diplomats serving in Ethiopia and other donor representatives on humanitarian issues.  S/he will monitor the security situation and provide input into a strategy for responding to new emergency needs.

Strategy Implementation and Planning
The incumbent will implement OFDA strategy for Ethiopia in conjunction with OFDA’s Washington office and the RA participating in contingency planning efforts.

Collaboration with USAID/Ethiopia
The incumbent will work with USAID/Ethiopia to develop and implement a new strategic objective, entitled “SO 13: Capacity to Anticipate and Manage through Shocks Increased.”  S/he will promote collaboration with USAID/Ethiopia programs where appropriate.
 
Program Development
The incumbent will work with NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies who are developing proposals, including grant amendments and extensions, for OFDA, ensure their compliance with “OFDA’s Guidelines for Grant Proposals and Reporting,” review concept papers and proposals and provide recommendations and comments to OFDA for final funding determination.

Program Management
The incumbent will monitor and evaluate OFDA-funded programs, visiting projects on a regular basis.  S/he will report to OFDA on the quality of the partners’ work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions.  Following discussions with OFDA, s/he will recommend corrective actions to grantees and ensure that grantees provide progress and financial reports on a timely basis.

Coordination and Representation
The incumbent will coordinate with the donor community to develop integrated, nonduplicative programs and with the USG on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations.  S/he will represent USG humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors to Ethiopia interested in humanitarian issues.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:  The incumbent will take direction from and report to the OFDA/DRM Division Chief in Washington.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>Amendment 1

As a result of the combined synopsis solicitation below the following questions were received in the contracts office.  The due date for responses is unchanged.  The questions and answers are as follows:


Question 1: Will "replacement" FVB/N wild type (+/+)females be provided as needed by the Government, or will a colony breeding replacements need to be maintained?

Answer 1: The Government shall replace wild-type females to contractor as needed or requested.  It is important to point out that these are commercially available wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice, not FVB/N mice. 

Question 2: It is not clear whether the Government wants only hemizygous (T/+) females retained/produced for research use, or if they want hemizygotes of both sexes. 

Answer 2:   The Government wants only hemizygous females retained/produced for research use.  Hemizygous males will only be maintained and used for breeding. 

Question 3: The Government refers to producing non-transgenic mice.  Does it mean FVB/N wild type (+/+) animals, or animals produced by breeding found to be non-transgenic during PCR analysis?  

Answer 3:  Non-transgenic mice refer to female progeny that do not express the transgene by PCR analysis.

Question 4: Does the Government intend to set a specific production quota by gender?

Answer 4: For male transgenic mice, this will be based on establishing breeding pairs and setting aside a small reserve for replacement.  For female mice (transgenic and non-transgenic), this will be based on numbers specified in the contract. 

Question 5: The RFP states that one to one breeding is how the breeders should be paired but does not clarify what sex and ages of progeny are needed.

Answer: Breeding shall be conducted using young (> 8 week), healthy hemizygous male transgenic mice with young (> 8 week), healthy female wild-type mice.  Once weaned, female offspring will be maintained as part of the stock colony and used experimentally at the discretion of the Government.  Male transgenic mice will be maintained for the expressed purpose of colony breeding.

Question 6: Will the Government specify a requirement to cull litters to a certain number before weaning?

Answer 6: Male offspring can be culled once a sufficient reserve is established for breeding and future replacement of breeders due to low production or health reasons.  (Male transgenic mice also develop mammary tumors.)  Female transgenic and non-transgenic progeny shall be maintained at the discretion of the Government.

Question 7: Will the supplies needed to perform the technical manipulations be provided by the Government or by the contractor?  This information is needed for preparing the cost proposal. 

Answer 7: The Government shall provide primers for PCR reactions and arrange for normal B6 female mice for breeding purposes to be delivered directly to the contract facility, as needed.  The contractor shall procure all other supplies for technical work.

Question 8:   The solicitation states that the breeding colony must not suffer due to cross contamination.  For example, previous RFPs of aging mouse colonies request that there must be two separate and distinct colonies.  Does the Government intend that this colony be established in a similar manner?

Answer 8: No. 

Question 9.  The solicitation states that some animals may be returned to the contract facility after certain interventions.  Does the Government want these animals returned to the primary colony of origin or placed in a separate location upon return?

Answer 9: After experimental manipulations, animals may b e placed in a separate location, as long as it is dedicated to mice and there is no evidence of contamination in that room. 




This is a combined synopsis solicitation for commercial services, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation includes applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2001-26 (01/2005).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 451710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.   BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  The Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology of the Center for Cancer Research of the National Cancer Institute has undertaken the experimental evaluation of numerous immunotherapy strategies for neoplastic disease of solid tumors, including recombinant viral-based vaccines and adoptive T cell transfer.   The purpose of this acquisition is to establish and maintain a mouse transgenic breeding colony to be used as a pre-clinical animal model to investigate mechanistic questions in tumor progression and antitumor therapy. We have a unique mouse model termed "MTAG" that develops primary and metastatic mammary cancer (as a consequence of mammary gland specific-transgene expression) in which to study host-tumor interactions.  The nature of tumor development in these mice better mirrors what occurs in human neoplasia.  The overall goals of these studies may thus have important conceptual and practical implications for the immunotherapy of patients with neoplastic disease. The offeror will provide animal care and maintenance for approximately 200 mice (per month) for experimental procedures, and the necessary breeding colonies to produce, replenish and maintain the mouse colony.  Because the female transgenic mouse of interest will be hemizygous, it will also be necessary to screen the offspring via polymerase chain reaction to identify the appropriate transgene-positive mice. The experimental procedures will integrate both cellular and molecular biological techniques to study characteristics of the host-tumor interaction, as well as the design and analysis of immune-based therapeutic approaches to potentially intervene with malignant progression.  The immune studies require dedicated laboratory space to minimize any known contaminants, which may compromise the activity of the immune cells. Therefore, a dedicated mouse facility is required to house and breed these transgenic mice, to provide screening of the offspring and to identify offspring expressing the transgene.  CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to provide the Line Items below: Line Item 1.
