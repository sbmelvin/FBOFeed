<SUBJECT>D -- NATO NC3A Notification of Intent (NOI) to invite bids related to its plan to provide long term commercial SATCOM to support ISAF expansion in Afghanistan
<SOLNBR>2004-5VA30224-0-9
<CONTACT>David Newsom, Trade & Industry Analyst - NATO Company Certification, Phone 202-482-7417, Fax 202-482-5650, Email dnewsom@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) has issued a Notification of Intent (NOI) of its Intention for Bidding (IFB) from all NATO countries related to is plan to provide a long term commercial Satellite Communications System (SATCOM) to support the International Security Assistance Force’s (ISAF) Expansion.  This project is an Urgent Requirement in support of ISAF and will be funded under the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).

The North Atlantic Council has approved the expansion of the ISAF mission to support a number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and forward operating bases expanding the current ISAF area of operation.  This has resulted in a very urgent operational requirement to provide the long-term communications and Communications and Information Systems (CIS) infrastructure to enable the Commander of ISAF to exercise command and control over this enlarged mission.  In addition to the urgency of this requirement, there is a critical shortage of available deployable NATO CIS capability, both in terms of equipment and manpower.  Analysis conducted by Allied Command Operations concluded that it is inappropriate to use military equipment to provide satellite baseband support for the ISAF mission expansion.  These scarce assets are required for the NATO Response Force (NRF) and there is a very high cost of deploying military containers and vehicles to Afghanistan.  This ISAF CIS solution is expected to be needed for at least five (5) years.  Discussions with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) showed even if this capability was available today, the scalable and expected long term nature of CIS support to ISAF would still best be served by outsourcing a service to provide this capability.  NATO will require its limited deployable CIS assets for the NRF which may be tasked with rapid and short duration deployments.  The required capability will provide CIS services and their embedded communications services from a NATO manned facility in Kabul to over 30 remote locations, or Points of Presence (POP), within Afghanistan where other NATO units will be based.  This includes local CIS network infrastructure, equipment and personnel.  Any contractor delivered solution must be capable of supporting further ISAF mission expansion if and when this is authorized by NATO.

This project considers and uses, where possible, equipment from earlier projects, specifically serial 2004/5VA30223 – Provide Commercial SATCOM to Support ISAF Expansion (IOC).  Only equipment and services considered essential to expand and support ISAF expansion complying with the Minimum Military Requirement (MMR) are requested.

THIS PROGRAM IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING AUTHORIZED AND THE ESTIMATED TIME FRAME FOR THE RELEASE OF THE INVITATION FOR BIDDING (IFB)/REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) IS THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005.  ALL FIRMS INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCUREMENT MUST BE CERTIFIED AND NOMININATED BY THEIR NATIONAL DELEGATIONS WITH THE REQUIRED DECLARATION OF ELIGIBILITY. REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED.  YOUR FIRM MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BID MATERIALS FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This notice replaces notice dated 27 Sep 2004, reference number DECON, with an original response date of 8 Nov 2004.  That notice is cancelled and replaced by this posting.  The classification code is changed from 42 – fire fighting, rescue & safety equipment to 68 - Chemical and Chemical Products, and the response date is now 30 November 2004.
DESCRIPTION:  The Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) Systems Manager is examining all current decontaminants and applicators to determine what interim solutions exist for the ability to decontaminate the interiors of vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within, which have been exposed to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents/contamination and/or Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs)/Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and new threat agents (NTAs).     This requirement is associated with Joint Service and multinational capabilities for detecting, identifying and eliminating CBRN hazards. JPID will decontaminate sensitive equipment items installed in platform interiors without requiring removal of the equipment.

This announcement is for mature chemical and biological (CB) agent decontamination systems.     Mature, is Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Six or higher per DoD 5000.2-R, Appendix 6.     TRL-6 means that a system prototype has been demonstration in a relevant environment.     Prototype system is well beyond the breadboard and has been tested in a relevant environment.     Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment.     Your applicator/technology must offer significant improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered. Your applicator/technology must offer significantly improved performance and/or other potential benefits (such as reduced logistics burden) over currently fielded military systems to be considered.
Capability for the decontamination effort review is the ability to decontaminate chemical and biological agents on non-removable sensitive pieces of equipment, located in vehicles, aircraft or shipboard areas. At a minimum these systems shall use applicators that are man-portable or do not require dedicated prime movers (trailer mounts or ?slip ins? are acceptable).     Due to the operational environment, decontaminants that can be stored at up to 150oF without significant loss of effectiveness are needed. 

For consideration, potential decontamination technology providers must: l) Demonstrate decontamination efficacy against chemical warfare agents.     Provide testing results on the efficacy against VX, HD and a G-type agent performed by a reputable Chemical Agent Surety Laboratory, either domestic or foreign. 2) Demonstrate a decontamination efficacy to kill bacterial spores such as Bacillus anthracis or simulant such as B. subtilis, B. globigii, or B. thuringensis, etc.     3) Supply decontaminant/ system information on material compatibility. The general materials in the various platforms consist of categories such as plastics, alloys, elastomers, metals to name a few. If data on the system does not exist, at the minimum, a paper study of the components should be provided. 4) Supply Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all products.     5) Provide evidence of production capability/capacity. 6) Not produce any uncontrollable hazards (residue or secondary) that are toxic or corrosive during decontamination operations. 7) Describe or illustrate packaging and/or mixing options.     8) Disclose detailed shipping and storage requirements or restrictions as well as the results of pot and shelf life testing.     9) Be compatible with Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) clothing and not present a hazard to equipment or personnel while being operated in MOPP.     10) Using its product, provide the results of developmental and operational testing in the decontamination of integral sensitive equipment, fixed facilities such as buildings, and terrain.     11) Provide procedures for applying the decontaminant on large equipment, aircraft, vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities and aircraft, to include sensitive equipment within. 12) Identify on-going federal, commercial, DoD contractual effort that is within scope of the above objectives along with point of contact and contact information. 
NOTE:     Any change in the formulation of a selected product requires resubmission of updated (e.g. surety, material compatibility, pot life, shelf life, etc.) data.

For submissions to be considered as decontamination systems, developers/sponsors must electronically supply (.doc or .pdf format) the preceding information in the order and format in which it is presented to Mr. Leo Gomez, leo.gomez@brooks.af.mil, no later than close of business November 8, 2004. Telephonic and hard copy responses will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Provide Electrical Bonding for 117 Bldgs on Hill AFB and Little Mountain
<SOLNBR>FA8201-05-B-0001
<RESPDATE>120904
<ARCHDATE>01312005
<CONTACT>Clare Wang, Contract Negotiator, Phone 801-586-6637, Email clare.wang@hill.af.mil
<DESC>APPROXIMATE ISSUE DATE: 9 Nov 04
This project is to provide the bonding required between the electrical system ground and the lightning protection ground bus bar as required in NFPA 780 Paragraph 3.14.2. This project includes 117 buildingsOne hundred and eleven (111) buildings are in “Controlled” areas on Hill Air Force Base and six (6) are at the Little Mountain facility.
The installed grounding bus bar for each building is mounted ‘close’ to where the building electrical service equipment is mounted. Each building will be different but there are two basic types of buildings; one with the electrical service and grounding bus bar mounted inside and the other type with the electrical service and grounding bus bar mounted outside. The grounding bus bar is 12 inches long, 4 inches high, and ¼ inch thick. There are 5 sets of mounting holes for cable connectors. Each set of mounting holes has 3 holes; with two holes 1 inch center to center and the other holes ¾ entrance cabinet and at least every 5 feet in between. All support clamps used outside will be either stainless steel or UL rated for exterior use with copper conductors. 
The buildings with the grounding bus bar mounted inside do not have the 4/0 cable from the lightning protection system connected to the grounding bus bar. In every one of these buildings the contractor shall provide a 4/0 compression connector for connecting to the grounding bus bar. Exothermic connectors are not allowed for this case because the exothermic reaction would have to take place inside a building with hazardous materials. Contractor will also be required to fill in the hole into the building where the 4/0 AWG grounding conductor comes through the wall. Contractor shall clean any debris from the hole and use clear silicone sealant to neatly fill in the space (both sides of the wall) around the cable.  For entrance into the electrical system cabinet, the contractor shall either use a knock out into the service entrance cabinet or drill a hole for entrance. The contractor shall use appropriate safety procedures when working in the electrical service cabinet to ensure safety of personnel and equipment. Contractor shall provide a plastic bushing to protect the conductor from the metal cabinet. After installation of grounding conductor through bushing, the contractor shall seal the bushing with clear silicon sealant around the conductor. The contractor shall connect the grounding conductor to the ground bus in the electrical system service entrance cabinet. Contractor shall provide and install lug on end of cable as required to make the connection to the existing, grounding bus.  All hardware for outside work will be stainless steel. Connection to the mounted grounding bus bar (See Item 2) will be made with a 3/8 inch stainless steel bolt, nut, 2 flat washers, and split lock washer for each of the two holes. All equipment used will be UL or FM labeled. All work will be done in a workmanlike manner. Conductor runs will be parallel or perpendicular to building lines. Contractor will clear up all debris caused by this project. Contractor will provide and install any miscellaneous items or materials for a complete and functioning project.  All of the buildings in the project do not have their lightning protection installed yet. As of February 1, 2004 there are about 75 buildings complete. The rest should be completed by July 2004. Contractor may be held up somewhat waiting for lightning protection to be installed on some buildings. Contractor will not be held responsible for delays caused by lightning installation contractor.

<DESC>GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Lead Designer

FOR THE BIRCH BAYH U.S. COURTHOUSE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA

Architect Engineer Services Solicitation #GS05P05GBC0001 Indianapolis, Indiana

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in adaptive reuse architecture, historic preservation, mechanical and electrical engineering. Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Professional Services are required for the preservation, modernization and renovation of the Birch Bayh Courthouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. 

Through the preservation and modernization of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation. In accord with this tradition, the GSA Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values.  As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements. All projects will be LEED-EB certified. 

The facility, designed by Rankin and Kellogg and built in 1905, is 459,121gross square feet and contains 373,876 rentable square feet. The structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is located in the heart of downtown Indianapolis, at 46 East Ohio Street. The project proposes to replace the roof, the flashing, and downspouts; upgrade the windows; upgrade toilet rooms to meet ADA and provide major alterations to mechanical, electrical, life safety, and plumbing systems, at the Birch Bayh U.S. Courthouse.  The project also includes preservation of many of the building’s historic mosaics, frescoes, and murals.  

The Estimated Construction Cost range of the project is $35 million to $45 million.  The scope of work may include, but is not limited to, the following: survey of the existing conditions; detail scope verification; presentations for client and historic preservation agencies; energy conservation analysis; complete architectural and engineering design; preparation of specifications and CADD drawings for construction documents; value engineering; cost analysis; post construction contract services (PCCS); record drawings and construction phase A-E inspection services; and other related services deemed necessary to provide for a completely functional facility. Throughout the design process, the selected A-E will assist the Government in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within the Congressionally mandated cost limitation for the project. The construction contract is envisioned to be procured through a source selection process that will incorporate a base contract and options for those elements of work that can be executed within the congressionally mandate cost limitation. Drawings shall be created and submitted in native AutoCAD, latest release. Drawings created in other CAD programs and then translated into AutoCAD are not acceptable. Formatting for electronic drawings shall be per GSA standards. Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall be submitted in the latest MSOffice edition available at the time of contract award. The firm/joint venture shall update software versions at their own expense. 

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.  The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In STAGE I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the Lead Designer and/or Design Firm. In STAGE II, short-listed firms will be interviewed. 

STAGE I: The first stage will establish the architectural capabilities of the  Lead Designer. The A/E Firm as used in the RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The mechanical/electrical engineering requirements are a large portion of the total scope of this project but those disciplines will be evaluated in phase II. In the first stage, a short list minimum of three (3) A-E design firms will be selected for continuation into the second phase. The short list will be based on the A-E design firms’ submittal in response to this request for qualification (RFQ). The A-E design firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver design excellence in judicial design, historic preservation, and renovation of large complex projects, and will express its design approach and philosophy. The documentation will be in an 8 ½” x 11” format.  The assembled Stage 1 portfolio should be no more than 1/2” thick..

Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:    (1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%): The A-E design firm shall submit graphics (maximum of five pages per project) of five (5) relevant projects completed with the past 10 years. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including tangible evidence where possible i.e. certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. Demonstrating design excellence) and discuss, if relevant, how the historic preservation, working in an occupied facility, and other design constraints were satisfied by the design solution. 2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%): In the lead designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy as it relates to this project, approach to public architecture, the challenge of resolving historic preservation issues and parameters that may apply specifically to the modernization of historic buildings with the focus on the unique aspects of installing state-of-the-art and flexible utility systems in historic buildings. (3) LEAD PORTFOLIO (25%): Submit a written description (maximum of one page per project) and graphics ( (maximum of three per project) of up to three (3) relevant designs completed within the past ten years attributable to the lead designer. Narratives shall include a discussion of design challenges as well as the resolution(s) and lead designer’s philosophy, responsibility, and influence on the design team. (4) LEAD DESIGNER’S PROFILE (15%): Submit a biographical sketch including education, professional experience, and recognition for design efforts. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to this project.  

STAGE II: The short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II that reflect the entire design team.  The SF 330 may be obtained from http://www.gsa.fov.forms.far.htm. The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  

The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the design team’s understanding of the unique aspects of the project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance plan.    Responses to the evaluation criteria and interview questions will be used to rank the A/E Teams.

This selection is open to A/E design firms within the United States. When developing the project team required for Stage II, at least 35% of the design effort (including working drawings) must be performed within the designated geographical area (state of Ohio). In Stage II of the selection process, the short-listed A/E design firms are required to demonstrate how this will be accomplished. Stage II: Following short listing, the successful offerors shall submit SF 330 for their entire project team.. Continuity of key personnel for the duration of the project will be essential. It is not necessary to re-submit information submitted in Phase I. GSA will establish the date these submittals are due and will provide new selection criteria for the interviews and final selection. The turnaround for the submission of the SF 330’s will be within 5 weeks of the short listed firm’s notification. This serves as notice to all interested firms that interviews will be conducted promptly after receipt of SF 330s: GSA plans to interview the short-listed firms in Chicago at a time and place to be determined and described in the shortlist notification. All firms need to be cognizant that an award is scheduled for April 2005. The contract for AE services will be awarded pending availability of funds.

Seq., the A-E will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, small woman-owned, HUBZone small business and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of the contract. The use of subcontractors/consultants shown in the Stage II Form 330 will be reflected in a Subcontracting Plan which will be included in the contract. The detailed plan is required to be submitted. Each individual firm will determine the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals for this project. A small business criterion for each category is based on the contractor’s average annual receipts for the proceeding three fiscal years. Contact your local SBA office for further information. Firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest subcontracting goals possible for small business, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business and small disadvantaged business concerns.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<SUBJECT>A -- RFI 05-05 Simulation-Based Training and Exercise for Incident Management
<SOLNBR>HSSCHQ-05-I-102604
<RESPDATE>111504
<ARCHDATE>11302004
<CONTACT>Charlotte Rupprecht, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-5856, Fax 202-254-6167, Email Charlotte.Rupprecht@dhs.gov
<DESC>This is an initial RFI to identify existing, operational systems and new, innovative technologies that can support simulation-based training for incident management. The target audience for this training includes incident commanders, government officials, and emergency managers that would be called upon during the response to a large scale incident. The overall research and development goal is to facilitate effective
implementation of the National Incident Management System (NIMS -
http://www.fema.gov/nims/nims.shtm). The NIMS Training and Exercises capability objective has been defined as the ability to create a proficiency to effectively support
and/or manage catastrophic incidents, regardless of cause or complexity, utilizing the National Incident Management System.
The purpose of this RFI is to identify operational systems that could be immediately deployed in a simulation-based training prototype and new, innovative technologies that
could significantly enhance early prototypes and be integrated into future developed systems. (An early prototype would be utilized as part of a capabilities-based needs
assessment that will determine the overall operational and functional requirements for NIMS training, identify capability and technology gaps, and, ultimately provide the
technology objectives to be achieved through the DHS research, development, test and evaluation program.) Ultimately, any system or technology deployed must function in an
open architecture environment and be capable of scaling from a local training and exercise environment to a national exercise similar to the TOPOFF exercises.

White papers need to identify existing simulation systems, models, and/or new, innovative technologies that can support the functional elements of the NIMS:
o Interagency operations
o Pre-planning processes
o Resource management
o Team building
o Crisis leadership training
o Complexity recognition
o Critical decision making
o Situational awareness
o Information management
Of particular interest are modeling and simulation systems and technologies that are capable of supporting activities such as:
o Evacuation planning 
o Traffic management
o Resource allocation, credential tracking, and accountability
o Dynamic problem recognition and conflict resolution
o Atmospheric hazard predictions
o Community relevant, context sensitive, cause & effect modeling
o Population and behavioral dynamics
o Hazard, event consequence, and protective action modeling

In addition, modeling & simulation systems and technologies must be capable of easily integrating with existing private or public technologies (e.g. systems and technologies
developed at the Department of Energy national laboratories or by DoD).

Process:
Any white paper submissions should describe existing, mature systems and/or new,
innovative technologies that can be applied to this effort. State whether a complete
simulation system, a component model, or an applicable technology.

Submission guidelines:
Please provide the following information for consideration (<5 pages)
1) Overall System(s) Description
i. What is the underlying science?
ii. What is the functional capability of the system(s)/technology?
iii. What is the capability for importing/exporting community specific
and/or “real world” data?
iv. What infrastructure is required (e.g., computing power, fixed or mobile, internet connectivity, etc.)?
v. Who are the current users and how often is the capability used?
vi. Is the capability already integrated or federated with other models or simulation tools?
vii. If federated with other models, does the system use a
standard/open interface?
viii. What is the level of fidelity?
ix. What is the scalability in terms of users, magnitude of event, and number of features, etc.?
x. Is it proprietary or open architecture?
xi. What the restrictions on use in open environment?
2) Sample data product output (if available)

Key Factors
1. Ability to meet NIMS functional requirements
2. Ability to work (integrate or federate) with other capabilities to produce a single, integrated product.
3. Technology applicability.
4. Technology maturity / development horizon.

Within the scope of this effort are systems engineering tasks and support; requirements analysis; system design; system architecture studies; independent analysis, verification and validation; tactical data applications; support software development; and web page, and database development, design, maintenance and server support.  This effort also provides for life cycle support of surveillance programs/systems/networks, and tactical data communications including automated radio communications systems and satellite terminal systems.  Trade-off studies may also be required to provide a basis for the selection of software/firmware and development mthods, which translate required system improvements into funcitonal system elements.  The solicitation will be issued using full and open competition and an indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity type contract with a cost plus fixed fee pricing arrangement over a five-year base period of performance.  The estimated level of effort is 85,920 man-hours per year for each of five years for a grand total of 429,600 man-hours.  The NAICS code is 541330 engineering services and the small business size standard is $23.0 million.  Successful offerors must maintain facility and personnel security clearances at the secret level.  The solicitation will be a follow-on action to an unrestricted solicitation N66001-99-R-5020 that resulted in the award of four contracts: N66001-00-D-5042 with SAIC; N66001-00-D-50432 with Anteon; N66001-00-D-5044 with Northrop Grumman; and N66001-00-D-5045 with Advanced Communication Systems.  Awardees of contracts under this solicitation will compete for task orders to perform actual work.   Each contract will be awarded for the entire estimated level of effort of 429,600 man-hours needed for the total requirement.  However, the competition of task orders may reduce each awardee's actual total effort to a point significantly below the ceiling value of each award.

The solicitation will only be available electronically on the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) E-Commerce Web Page at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil under Business Opportunities.

<SUBJECT>A--TESTING NICKEL EMISSIONS FROM METAL FINISHING SOURCES
<SOLNBR>PR-CI-05-10017
<CONTACT>JOSHUA M. BOWERS, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2104, E-Mail: bowers.joshua@epa.gov
<DESC>The National Risk Management Laboratory (NRMRL), located in Cincinnati, Ohio, intends to negotiate with a small business, on a competitive basis, for a project entitled "Testing Nickel Emissions from Metal finishing Sources." The objective of this project is to develop data to check the validity of AP42 estimations of total nickel air emissions that are used in the MFFRST model, compare total nickel emissions using EPA method 29 and modified method 306A (Described in Appendix A), and evaluate the factors that affect nickel emissions such as surface tension, current density or loading, and type of bath.  The AP42 regulations account for such factors as cathode efficiency, plating bath concentration, current density, and other factors. The contractor shall be familiar with the AP42 regulations and how they apply to non chromium electroplating. The contractor must be familiar with EPA Method 29 sampling protocol and Method 306A sampling protocol. Based on experience, the contractor shall develop a testing protocol for the stated objective. This protocol includes: bath temperature, tank size and shape, current density, bath concentration, type of parts and other factors. The testing must be conducted at a minimum of 85% of the individual tanks production capacity. Based on the facility chosen, the contractor may need to construct a temporary hood for the Method 29 and 306A testing. Specifically, the contractor shall: 1.	Obtain access to a facility or facilities that are willing to work with EPA on nickel emission testing. The facility must have electroless nickel plating, rack and barrel nickel plating with both air and pump agitation or mixing, and nickel barrel plating. Plating facilities must be approved by the EPA Technical Project Manager.  2.	Devise a system (flexible duct and plastic partitions) to feed outside air into the plating area to obtain "clean" background air (outdoor ambient levels of nickel) for the Method 29 sampling protocol. This may not be necessary if background air is determined to be clean based on plant data/ worker exposure levels and is approved by the EPA Project Officer. 3.	Obtain three data points using Method 29 sampling protocol for nickel emissions in each of the following conditions.  (A&B)Electroless Nickel (boron or phosphorus, air (A) and pump (B) agitation with a simple mesh pad to control splashing into the ventilation system, (C&D)Watts nickel bath, rack plating with pump mixing, without wetting agents (C)(higher surface tension) and mesh pad and (D) with wetting agents (lower surface tension) and mesh pad. (E&F)Watts nickel bath, barrel plating with pump mixing, without wetting agents  (E)(higher surface tension) and mesh pad and (F) with wetting agents (lower surface tension) and mesh pad. (G) Sulfamate nickel bath, rack plating with pump mixing (no air agitation), with wetting agents (low surface tension) and with mesh pad. (H & I) Woods Strike with (H) and without (I) wetting agents with mesh pad. Conditions for the testing shall be consistent in terms of bath conditions and plating production. Dummy parts can be used to achieve a minimum of 85% of tank production capacity and run at that capacity for the entire duration of the emission testing. If actual parts are used the plating can be stopped briefly for part change out. 4.	Obtain three data points using Method 306A sampling protocol for nickel emissions by replicating the conditions of  A,B,C,D and G in requirement 3 above. 5.	Allow for testing of 9 additional nickel tank sources. 6.	Assess the impact of using wetting agents on the Woods Strike Bath with visual quality checks and adhesion testing of final product. 7.	Compare the actual emissions with the theoretical emissions predicted by the AP42.  8.         The contractor shall comply with all QA requirements. This plan shall include monitoring nickel in the background air and for the Methods 29 & 306A sampling.  The solicitation will be issued as a 100% small business set-aside. EPA anticipates the award of  a firm-fixed-price contract by February 5, 2005. Solicitation No. PR-CI-05-10017 is expected to  be issued around November 10, 2004 and close 30 days thereafter. It will be available on the  Internet at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. Interested parties are expected to download the  solicitation and subsequent amendments from the web site. Hard copies will not be distributed. It  is the responsibility of potential offerors to frequently check the site for amendments. All  responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. Contract award  will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. The applicable NAICS code is 541710.

<DESC>The US EPA Office of Pesticide Programs/Environmental Fate and Effects Division (OPP/EFED) is seeking to acquire technical support in assessing the fate and transport of pesticides in the environment. Pesticides are regulated under several laws, primarily the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)  which authorizes EPA to oversee the registration, distribution, sale, and use of pesticides.  The Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) is responsible for regulating pesticides through the processes of registration, review, and re-registration.   Registrant studies are conducted using OPP developed data requirements and guidelines?and along with other applicable information, the data generated from these studies are used to assess the potential impact of pesticide use on human health and the environment.  To ensure appropriate quality assurance, this data is further evaluated for adequacy and validity prior to conducting risk assessments.   Following these evaluations, the data is used for human health and ecological resource risk assessments.  OPP also convenes scientific workshops and seminars to discuss and resolve scientific issues associated with the registration, registration review and re-registration of pesticides. This requirement shall provide support primarily in the areas of: (1) the review and evaluation of available data pertaining to the chemistry and fate of pesticides in the environment (including environmental monitoring data); (2) the valuation of environmental risk from pesticides, and; (3)  assessment of pesticide fate and transport in the environment.  This requirement shall also provide occasional support to EPA in the researching of pesticide fate and transport science policy issues and the development of science policy options for evaluation and consideration by EPA.  In accordance with Federal policy under FAR?Part 37, the proposed work under this contract is considered "performance-based."  The potential contract will be categorized as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type with a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods with an estimated total labor quantity of approximately 22,000 hours per period.  This procurement is classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541620, entitled "Environmental Consulting Services."   The size standard for this industry classification is $6.0 million for potential small and small disadvantaged businesses.  This requirement is currently being performed under EPA contract 68-W-00-070.  Dynamac Corporation, the incumbent under that contract, will be ineligible to compete as the prime contractor for this action due to its status as a large business.    This action is being conducted competitively as a total small business set aside in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.5.  Competition is limited to qualified small business concerns as defined by the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR Part 121 (also see FAR Part 19.102) at the time of submission of offer.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) shall be posted on the Internet on or about November 9, 2004.  Proposal submission shall be due forty-five (45) calendar days after the RFP issuance date. Detailed information for this requirement is provided via a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) and its associated appendices which are currently posted at the following: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0411205/index.htm  Please monitor the Internet site for the status regarding this procurement.  SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENTS TO OFFERORS			 A. Percentage of Work to be Performed, and Use of Consultants: The offeror is advised of the language under FAR Clause 52.219-14 "Limitations on Subcontracting" paragraph (b)(1) which states that under a contract for services "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."  The final proposal should realistically demonstrate how the offeror will be able to comply with this clause.  Additionally, please note that consultants are considered subcontractors and not employees of the prime contractor.  Therefore, consultants are considered as part of the work being subcontracted.  B. Guidance for Performance-Based Service Contracting (PBSC): As noted, the proposed work under this contract is being considered "performance-based."  In general, performance-based contracting methods are intended to ensure that required performance quality levels are achieved and that total payment is related to the degree that services performed meet contract standards.  Performance-based contracts, (a) Describe the requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work, (b) use measurable performance standards (i.e., terms of quality, timeliness, quantity, etc.) and quality assurance surveillance plans, and (c) specify procedures for reductions of fee or for reductions to the price of a fixed-price contract when services are not performed or do not meet contract requirements.   For more fundamental discussions of PBSC, see: Federal Acquisition Circular 97-1; Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 37.6; and OFPP's Policy Letter 91-2, "Service Contracting" and "A Guide to Best Practices for Performance-Based Service Contracting." The latter two publications are available from the Executive Office of the President's Office of Publications, 202-395-7332, and the Acquisition Reform Network, www.arnet.gov.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to continue scheduling support to the Marshall Space Flight Center Space Transportation Programs and Projects Office, specifically assisting the Auxiliary Propulsion Project, the Propulsion Technology and Integration Project, and the Orbital Express Project.   NASA/MSFC intends to purchase these services from Gray Research, Inc. as a sole source procurement for continued development, maintenance, analysis, and integration of project schedules, continued support to special requested project assessments and continued support to an integrated master scheduler. Competition is impractical because the support to the above identified activities is already in progress using a small team of MSFC and Gray Research personnel and these activities rely heavily upon the processes and technical expertise obtained during the current effort and the information gained from this process cannot be duplicated or communicated to another vendor in a timely manner to avoid impact schedules. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Kimberly J. Adams, PS53, via email to kimberly.j.adams@nasa.gov not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on 10 November 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@ustda.gov "PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE". PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Ms. Carmen Neagu, Director, International Affairs Department, Electrocentrale Bucuresti SA, 202E, Splaiul Independentei, 060021-Bucharest, ROMANIA; Phone: +40-21-407-9915; Fax: +40-21-212-6593; E-mail: carmen_neagu@elcen.ro  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of upgrading the control systems at five SC Electrocentrale Bucuresti SA (ELCEN) heat and power plants in Bucharest. 

ELCEN was founded in 2002 as part of the restructuring of Termoelectrica SA, the state-owned power generating company.  ELCEN owns eight power plants in total, five of which are in the City of Bucharest. The city’s district heating system supplies heat to about 577,000 flats (2,000,000 people) and about 5,230 institutions (hospitals, schools, hotels, etc).  ELCEN’s five generating plants represent the most important heat sources for the City of Bucharest. Each plant provides hot water to the consumers located in its immediate area.  The plants can also provide heat to consumers in other areas through an interconnected steam-piping network. 

ELCEN has determined that the company can improve its operating efficiency if it can install a system-wide operating management procedure that will simultaneously optimize the operations of its five Bucharest plants. This will require the modernization of the control systems at each of the plants, and the installation of special software and controls in a central dispatching office.  

In 2002, Termoelectrica obtained a grant from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to perform an “Economical Operation Survey for Thermal Power Plants”. The study focused on Romania’s major thermal power stations, which included the largest plant in the ELCEN system, Bucuresti Sud.   Black and Veatch was the U.S. company selected to perform the study with the assistance of the Institute for Studies and Power Engineering (ISPE), a Romanian engineering company. The study, completed in November of 2003, included an evaluation of the control systems of 28 generating units at 9 power plants. The control system of each unit involved in the study was examined, and recommendations were made for upgrades and additions to the controls, instrumentation and optimization software at each plant. 

In light of the favorable results of the previous study, ELCEN would like to extend the study to include its five heat and power plants in Bucharest, including Bucuresti Sud.  Although the first study surveyed Bucuresti Sud, ELCEN would like it to be included in this study as well.  ELCEN does not wish to duplicate efforts as they have already upgraded most of the controls at Bucuresti Sud, but would like to implement a centralized system of controls that would coordinate controls for all five plants and optimize the entire operation.  The proposed study would enable ELCEN to simultaneously control the operations at each plant to meet the overall demands for heat and power at the highest net efficiency.  This, in turn, will result in generating electricity and heat at the lowest possible cost. The proposed study will incorporate the methodology used in the previous study to evaluate the controls needed at the five plants, and develop a comprehensive implementation plan for optimizing their combined operation.

Note:  In order to fulfill the Terms of Reference (TOR) of this Study, a Host Country subcontractor may be necessary.   The Grantee has stated its preference for a Host Country subcontractor, and suggests that ISPE of Romania serve as the Host Country subcontractor for this Study.  The Contractor may wish to subcontract with ISPE in order to fulfill the TOR.   The subcontract should not exceed $44,000 and may be paid by the Contractor from the USTDA Grant Funds.  A notional budget for the subcontract can be found in Annex 6 of the Request for Proposals (RFP).  The details of the TOR and budget for the Host Country subcontract will be determined during contract negotiations between the Contractor and the selected Host Country subcontractor. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $220,840 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed RFP, which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. local time, November 30, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Office on Disability, OS  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Dr. Michael Marge , Millersville, MD.

Purpose:
The purpose of this procurement is to assist the Office on Disability at HHS in the implementation and assessment of its project on addressing the health needs of infants, children and youth through two programs:  1) the National Initiative for Physical Fitness for Children and Youth with Disabilities and 2) the National Initiative on Effective Health Care Interventions for Infants and Young Children with Hearing Loss.
With regard to the National Initiative on Physical Fitness Program, the required work requires comprehensive knowledge of the physical fitness initiative and of the nine cooperating organizations and their capabilities to implement the program, highly specialized knowledge about the relationships between physical fitness and disability, special experience and background in programs that improve the health of children and adolescents with disabilities through physical health promotion, and management skills required to coordinate the efforts of nine voluntary cooperating national organizations that currently comprise this important National Initiative. This initiative, a priority program of both the President and HHS Secretary Thompson, has obtained national attention.  It includes time sensitive actions that are in operation and with completion dates covering a six-month timeframe that therefore requires the expertise and comprehensive knowledge of this program and all of its operational and evaluation steps that only Dr. Marge has. 

Dr. Marge has the extensive knowledge, background and skills to plan and assist in the implementation of the Initiative on Infants and Young Children with Hearing Loss. He was instrumental in the development and enactment of the Walsh Bill that provided funding for the national effort to identify newborns with hearing loss.  Dr. Marge has written a number of publications on the topic of hearing loss in children and has worked as a researcher and clinician in the area of communication problems of individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. He is known and respected by the major stakeholders in the care of children with hearing loss throughout the United States and provides the important component of helping the Office on Disability establish effective working relationships with all constituencies in the implementation of this program.

<DESC>COEUS 

Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, (USUHS) intends to utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, to hire an information system advisor/consultant to assist in the installation and implementation of the grants administration and management software program known as COEUS Version 4.0.  This software was developed by MIT and is utilized by many universities and institutes.  USUHS currently runs COEUS Version 3.5 with significant undocumented customization.  The work will consist of three phases:

Phase 1 – Set up COEUS Upgrade/Migration environment
The objective of this phase is to build the test environment on a comparable production server hardware and setup with the new Operating system (Windows 2000 or Windows server 2003), Network & Security configuration, Database installation (Oracle Database 8.1.7 or Oracle 9i) configuration and other supporting libraries

Phase 2 – Complete the step upgrade 
The objective of this phase is to do all the step upgrades in the test environment without customization. After the completion of this phase, all the code libraries and Database are upgraded to V4.0. Another important objective of this phase is to determine the time needed for production data migration and to address any difficulties with the data migration.

Phase 3 – Data Migration, Integrity testing and Documentation of Procedures
This is the final phase of the upgrade effort. COEUS V3.5 production server will not be available during the Data Migration and Integrity testing phase. To keep COEUS downtime to a minimum, the production server will be upgraded during off duty hours. After the completion of the Data migration, COEUS V4.0 will be limited to upgrade validation and integrity testing. Then COEUS V4.0 will be made available for all users, after successful integrity testing.  USUHS may at a later date determine that customization will be required.

Individuals with extensive technical and business knowledge of COEUS, extensive experience with the functionality and design of COEUS, such as setting up routing rules and maps for a university, setting up applicable parameters within COEUS, user and administrator maintenance, and COEUS web and be able to explain such topics as all of the entries in the COEUS INI files and parameter table, the security aspects of the system, links between proposals and awards, and electronic proposal submissions, and have hands-on experience with Windows 2003 or Windows 2000 servers, Apache web server, Oracle V8.1.7 or Oracle 9i, Powerbuilder 5 or above, and JAVA programming, who are available and interested in performing the above work are invited to provide the listed Contract Specialist with a resume addressing the above listed requirements, a brief discussion of the scope and challenges of this project and proposed hourly prices.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.

See Note(s) 22, 23 and 26.          

The only thing changed in this modification is the buyers contact information.  Melissa Masterson, buyer, (405) 739-5210 fax (405)739-2220.

<SUBJECT>70 -- GCSS BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE TOOL
<SOLNBR>HC1047-04-R-4005
<RESPDATE>110404
<ARCHDATE>11192004
<CONTACT>Akefeh Lambert, Contract Specialist, Phone (703)681-0922, Fax (703)681-0346, Email lamberta@ncr.disa.mil
<DESC>QUESTION1- Have any Business Intelligence Tools have been demonstrated to DISA? 
ANSWER 1-The GCSS PMO has been reviewing next generation tools for quite some time now, in light of the drastic architecture and infrastructure changes that the program needs to make in order to become fully net-centric.  During this process (over a year in length) we reviewed many different products, to include BI tools.  We only received one high level demo from Web Focus and that was done before we had solidified the requirement to include a BI tool within GCSS.  The information gained from this demo did not have any impact on whether GCSS should implement a BI tool into the infrastructure and was therefore not considered part of our market research or future evaluation to select a winning BI product.
QUESTION 2-Which Business Intelligence Tools have been demonstrated to DISA? 
ANSWER 2- As stated above, we have not formally received any demonstrations for BI tools.  This RFP was issued so we could formally review and evaluate all of the pertinent BI products available to make a decision to purchase.  
QUESTION 3- The RFP refers to Appendix B but it appears to be missing.  Can you please include Appendix B? 
ANSWER 3 - This was a mistake.  There is no Appendix B.
QUESTION 4- Can you please further define the Security Clearance requirements?  Does our facility clearance and ability to sponsor personnel satisfy the requirements for Security Clearances?  
ANSWER 4- GCSS (CC/JTF) is a US only SECRET system.  Therefore any consulting services provided as part of this RFP will require that personnel have US SECRET clearances that can support our requirements as soon as the contract is awarded.  
QUESTION 5- How many users are projected to use the BI licenses?  
ANSWER 5 - Approximately 5000 SIPRNet users.  However, our preference would be for an Enterprise License so we do not have track users and CPU/server usage simultaneously.  
QUESTION 6 - 4.4 Task 4. Consulting Services - in order for us to determine the amount of services required, could you help us get a better understanding of what the GCSS architecture consists of and what areas of integration are expected? Also, could you help us understand what deliverable will be required, i.e. databases to be supported, number and sophistication of reports, etc.
ANSWER 6 - We are targeting the below high-level architecture for our first release including the BI tool purchase.
 	BEA 8.1
Metamatrix 4.1
Solaris 9/10
Oracle 9
Waveset Lighthouse
Web Services-based architecture
End user browsers supported:  Netscape, IE, Mozilla
Number of databases:  1 mediator, which supplies access to many disparate data sources.  With the ability for the end user to use a data source from his workstation in reporting.
We anticipate the need to produce a range of reports from very simple to very highly sophisticated.  
QUESTION 7 - Selection Criteria - while I understand that the criteria are listed in order of importance, what is the weight that will be given to each as part of the evaluation: Technical, Cost, Non-Technical Information?
ANSWER 7 - Technical is of higher importance than Non-Technical and Cost information.  Cost will be used as a discriminating factor, but is still critical. 
QUESTION 8 - Are 15 pages the total number of pages allowed for the Technical Proposal, and the Cost, and the Non-Technical Information? Or, are the 15 pages just for the Technical Proposal?
ANSWER 8 - 15 pages for the Technical Proposal.  Please keep the Cost and Non-Technical information to a maximum of 5 pages total.
QUESTION 9 - 5.2 Evaluation - will the evaluation and decision be made solely on the 15 pages Technical Proposal or will the vendors be allowed to come in for live demonstrations? 
ANSWER 9 - Evaluation will be made on the 15 page technical proposal and cost.
 QUESTION 10 - Also, has a bake-off with customer data been considered as part of the evaluation and decision process? 
ANSWER 10 - Not at this time.

<DESC>This modification clarifies the description of work stated in the original notice posted 10/25/04.  Three USAID initiatives will be served through this IQC.  One initiative is the promotion of democratic governance.  The USAID report, “Foreign Assistance in the National Interest” identifies democratic governance as critical to successful development and calls for increased attention to democratic governance in programming across all sectors.  The second initiative is the increased emphasis on fragile states.  The Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance Bureau has responsibility for developing assistance strategies to generate positive impacts in fragile states. The third initiative that will be served is the newly established Millennium Challenge Account (MCA).  The MCA will provide substantial funding to selected countries that meet a variety of development indicators, including governance indicators.  Increased focus on governance dimensions, due to MCA-related incentives, may create new opportunities for technical assistance in support of democratic governance.  This IQC will provide services in three primary areas A)  Reinforcing legitimacy of state structure, policies, and functions B) Public management and C) Strategic planning, policy, and institutional reform.

The Government reserves the right to determine whether or not a competitive acquisition is feasible.  The purpose of this notice is to provide additional information to substantiate the Governments basis for identifying this as a sole source.  The incumbent contractor enters data into its proprietary database and web infrastructure  and maintains that data for the NMFS.  NMFS Enforcement personnel to access statistical reports and intelligence information.  At this time, the Government does not have rights to the data.

This action is intended to be the last of a sole source effort for this work.  The follow-on requirement will be subject to competitive acquisition procedures.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the Request For Information (RFI) which was posted 15 Sept 04.  Note changes in wavelength description in this paragraph, and the Technical POCs, along with information on the industry day.  Note that submissions are still due NLT 6 Oct 2004.  

This is a Request For Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201 (e).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, (AFRL), and DARPA/MTO do not presently intend to award a contract, but are in need of information on potential sources in the area of Adaptive Photonic Phase-Locked Elements.   The technical areas of interest are all technologies required to build an array of sub-apertures capable of transmitting, receiving, and rapidly steering spatially phased optical energy and images in which each sub-aperture should be transmissive.    AFRL and DARPA are potentially interested in demonstrating a modular, scaleable architecture capable of scaling to large apertures and high powers. A potential objective at program’s end would be for the components, as well as the entire system, to be available commercially.  We are interested in company capabilities to manufacture and commercialize required components.  Applications of interest include: laser weapons, laser targeting/sensing, laser communication, and laser countermeasure.  Compensating for atmospheric effects is required as part of any technical approach.  The primary wavelengths of interest are approximately 1.5 microns and 1 micron.  The Government contemplates a program which would consist of 2 or 3 phases.  The first phase is expected to be 12 months, with total program length expected to be up to 5 years. 

Potential goals for the first phase include: transmissive optical phased array sub-aperture elements of 2 cm diameter or more.  Actual shape of the sub-aperture elements is a trade space item. Less than 2 msec beam switching time, >50 % fill array factor, and, an array strell ratio of at least 60 %, and imaging on receive with resolution at least a factor of two beyond the diffraction limited resolution of a single sub-aperture.   The array of sub-apertures should include at least one sub-aperture surrounded on all sides by other sub-apertures.  Nonmechanical beam steering should be continuous to at least 20 degrees in any direction, covering a field of regard of at least 40 degrees.  Algorithms should be demonstrated to allow for necessary atmospheric compensation to meet final program goals.  Over-all transmission efficiency from electrical power to far field energy steered to 20 degrees in any direction should exceed 1 %, and be higher for smaller angle beam steering. 

Goals for the final phase(s) would be as follows:
Demonstration of a half meter array of sub-apertures using 100 or fewer sub-apertures, including the ability to compensate for any atmospheric effects in real time.  The demonstrated technology should be scaleable to powers of at least 100 kW for the weapon application and one or more kilowatts for the sensing application.   A significant fraction of those power levels should be demonstrated in this program.  An array fill factor of greater then 90 % is desired and a strell ratio >90 %.  Efficiency from electrical power to a far field transmitted beam steered to a 45 degree angle in any direction should exceed 7%.   Total efficiency at smaller steering angles should be higher.  Imaging resolution through moderate turbulence should be within a factor of 1.5 of a monolithic unsteered beam emitted from a half meter aperture through clear air or vacuum.  Steering time should be under 1 millisecond from any location in the field of regard to any other location.  As a goal any sub-aperture, or any combinations of sub-apertures, should be capable of being used independently for all functions. 

Interested parties should have documented expertise and existing capability in the design, development, and production of optical phased array beam steering, phased lasers, sub-aperture receive technologies, atmospheric compensation techniques, and/or the integrations of these technologies and should identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement including their capability to manufacture and commercialize the end-product.  Comments on the above objectives are also welcome. Corporate capabilities are of strong interest, preferably with a discussion of technologies actually demonstrated, and of laboratory/manufacturing facilities already in place.  

Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.  Formal responses should be e-mailed (preferred), faxed or mailed to:

<SOLNBR>Bullard102604
<RESPDATE>112204

<DESC>The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals is an active area of research at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Thermochemical and enzymatic processes are used to convert cellulose and hemicellulose to their component sugars for subsequent fermentation to useful products. NREL currently employ a high-temperature, dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment to hydrolyze hemicellulose followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose. 

NREL is seeking to reduce both operating and capital cost by increasing the concentration of solids processed during enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation processes. However, operating at high solid concentrations is challenging due to limited understanding of the rheological and mixing characteristics of high-solid biomass slurries and subsequent problems with heat and mass transfer. In addition, dynamic changes in rheology and mixing requirements can occur as the cellulose structure is broken down during enzymatic hydrolysis. The objective of this effort is to develop a fundamental understanding of the rheology and mixing of high-solids biomass slurries, ultimately generating information useful for process design. 

Interested parties can address ONE OR BOTH of the following topics:


1.  Characterization and Modeling the Rheology of High-Solids Biomass Slurries. This study should identify and quantify the factors that influence rheology of high-solids biomass slurries during enzymatic hydrolysis leading to development of mathematical models. The models should describe slurry rheology in terms of measurable parameters and slurry/biomass characteristics as they undergo transformation during enzymatic hydrolysis. Some of the factors that we believe are likely to influence rheology are listed below.
· Physical parameters – concentration of solids and particle size.
· Chemical structure– type of plant material and structure modification during chemical pretreatment and during enzymatic hydrolysis
· Interaction between biomass particles – electrostatic, friction, entanglement
· Characteristics of external fluid – pH, ionic strength, viscosity
While the above list is not exhaustive, it indicates the complexity involved in describing the rheology of high-solids biomass slurries.


2.  Reactor Design and Mixing of High-Solids Biomass Slurries. This study should develop reactor(s) designs to achieve good enzyme distribution and uniform temperature control with low mixing power input during high-solids enzymatic hydrolysis. This task would likely involve the following components:
· Design, purchase and/or construction of bench- and pilot-scale reactors
· Performance testing 
· Development of fluid dynamic models to assist in scale-up

Pretreated corn stover will be the material for these studies, although, pretreated poplar might be included as another test biomass source at a later stage during the project(s). Chemically pretreated biomass will be supplied by NREL as part of this effort. Interested parties should have a proven ability (i.e., facility and equipment) to perform this work, previous experience with the subject matter, and the ability to develop a strong experimental plan addressing project goals.

The responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT DOCUMENT is limited to 8 pages of single spaced text of 12-point font or equivalent, with a minimum of 1 inch margins all around.  Brevity is encouraged.

Any organizations interested in working with NREL to provide the above described effort may mail a list of qualifications, based on the either both topics or one of the two topics, including subpoints, discussed above.  Qualifications should be mailed to the following: Deborah J. Bullard, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, MS 3511, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, CO 80401-3393.  Submittals by e-mail are acceptable and should be sent to the following:  deborah_bullard@nrel.gov.  Electronic format of the Sources Sought response shall be in MSWord/Excel or WordPerfect.  DO NOT SEND SCANNED .PDF files.  TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Qualifications will be responsive to the items listed above.  Responses to this notice, whether mailed hard copy or sent electronically, must be received by 3:00 MST, Novemer 22, 2004.

Responding to this request identifies your organization as an interested candidate only.  Your submittal is NOT in response to a Request for Proposals (RFP).

<DESC>The objective of this effort is the integration, demonstration, and transition of key technologies and associated capabilities to the Command and Control On-the-move Network, Digital Over-the-horizon Relay (CONDOR) Capability Set acquisition program.  It is expected that this approach will provide an enhanced Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Over-the-Horizon (OTH) On-the Move (OTM) tactical communications and networking capability to the United States Marine Corps (USMC).  The CONDOR Capability Set includes the Gateway (GW), Point of Presence Vehicle (PoP-V), and Jump Command & Control Vehicle (JC2-V). The CONDOR GW provides OTM/OTH data connectivity between disparate EPLRS communities. The PoP-V allows units without EPLRS radios to connect to the tactical data network with their organic tactical data radios. The JC2-V allows forward elements to maintain synchronization on servers and track databases during displacements. The contractor shall characterize, integrate, demonstrate and recommend viable technical solutions in support of the transition of the CONDOR Capability Set to Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) Program Manager Communications Systems (PM COMM).

At a minimum, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks:

·	Conduct relevant technical analysis and develop a functional definition and capability description for the overall CONDOR Capability Set and develop recommendations for the overall system architecture and design.  The details of the design shall be incorporated in System Design Documentation.

·	Test the system, characterize the overall performance, and provide relevant documentation.

·	Provide input to PM COMMS and the CONDOR Program in the characterization and demonstration of an integrated Joint Communications Architecture.

·	The contractor shall analyze, define, and document the major capabilities to address line-of-sight limitations of existing Tactical Data Radios (TDR) and provide recommendations to enhance seamless mobility and reduce configuration requirements associated with the PoP-V.  The contractor shall develop a functional description of the POP-V capabilities achievable with the state of technology.

·	The contractor shall integrate, characterize, and demonstrate various Ku On-The-Move (OTM) systems.

·	The contractor shall provide expertise to help facilitate the building of additional prototype nodes and address concerns regarding IP Mobility and the ability for users to enter, exit, and transition between PoP-Vs.

·	Support tests, demonstrations, meetings, and technical reviews.

<DESC>This is a Request For Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201 (e).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, (AFRL), and DARPA/MTO do not presently intend to award a contract, but are in need of information on potential sources in the area of Adaptive Photonic Phase-Locked Elements.   The technical areas of interest are all technologies required to build an array of sub-apertures capable of transmitting, receiving, and rapidly steering spatially phased optical energy and images in which each sub-aperture should be transmissive.    AFRL and DARPA are potentially interested in demonstrating a modular, scaleable architecture capable of scaling to large apertures and high powers. A potential objective at program’s end would be for the components, as well as the entire system, to be available commercially.  We are interested in company capabilities to manufacture and commercialize required components.  Applications of interest include: laser weapons, laser targeting/sensing, laser communication, and laser countermeasure.  Compensating for atmospheric effects is required as part of any technical approach.  Primary wavelengths of interest are approximately 1.5 mm and 1 mm.  The Government contemplates a program which would consist of 2 or 3 phases.  The first phase is expected to be 12 months, with total program length expected to be up to 5 years. 

Potential goals for the first phase include: transmissive optical phased array sub-aperture elements of 2 cm diameter or more.  Actual shape of the sub-aperture elements is a trade space item. Less than 2 msec beam switching time, >50 % fill array factor, and, an array strell ratio of at least 60 %, and imaging on receive with resolution at least a factor of two beyond the diffraction limited resolution of a single sub-aperture.   The array of sub-apertures should include at least one sub-aperture surrounded on all sides by other sub-apertures.  Nonmechanical beam steering should be continuous to at least 20 degrees in any direction, covering a field of regard of at least 40 degrees.  Algorithms should be demonstrated to allow for necessary atmospheric compensation to meet final program goals.  Over-all transmission efficiency from electrical power to far field energy steered to 20 degrees in any direction should exceed 1 %, and be higher for smaller angle beam steering. 

Goals for the final phase(s) would be as follows:
Demonstration of a half meter array of sub-apertures using 100 or fewer sub-apertures, including the ability to compensate for any atmospheric effects in real time.  The demonstrated technology should be scaleable to powers of at least 100 kW for the weapon application and one or more kilowatts for the sensing application.   A significant fraction of those power levels should be demonstrated in this program.  An array fill factor of greater then 90 % is desired and a strell ratio >90 %.  Efficiency from electrical power to a far field transmitted beam steered to a 45 degree angle in any direction should exceed 7%.   Total efficiency at smaller steering angles should be higher.  Imaging resolution through moderate turbulence should be within a factor of 1.5 of a monolithic unsteered beam emitted from a half meter aperture through clear air or vacuum.  Steering time should be under 1 millisecond from any location in the field of regard to any other location.  As a goal any sub-aperture, or any combinations of sub-apertures, should be capable of being used independently for all functions. 

Interested parties should have documented expertise and existing capability in the design, development, and production of optical phased array beam steering, phased lasers, sub-aperture receive technologies, atmospheric compensation techniques, and/or the integrations of these technologies and should identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement including their capability to manufacture and commercialize the end-product.  Comments on the above objectives are also welcome. Corporate capabilities are of strong interest, preferably with a discussion of technologies actually demonstrated, and of laboratory/manufacturing facilities already in place.  

Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.  Formal responses should be e-mailed (preferred), faxed or mailed to:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 


(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

MacDill AFB intends to issue a purchase order to Congressional Quarterly, Inc., under the authority of FAR 6.302-1—only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A solicitation package is not available.  Additionally, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) applies, i.e., a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and an unacceptable delay would result in attempting to compete this requirement instead of not continuing with the provision of these highly specialized services from CQ.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotation, HSCG38-04-Q-101007 incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.  The North American Industry Classification System number is 336413. The small business size standard is 1000 employees.  This is an unrestricted procurement.  The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures In Accordance With (IAW) FAR Part 13.5.  The award will be IAW FAR 6.302-1.  

 CLIN 1 – Repair:  4620-14-462-8603, P/N A25400033-4B, (The following part numbers will be recognized as alternate part numbers under this award:  A25400033-4 OR a25400033-ABD) CSD Pump, estimated quantity of 25 each for base period year 1 and 2, 20 each for base period year 3 and 25 each for option period year 1 and 2.  

Interested parties may submit a quotation, which shall include a performance work statement, performance metrics, and incentives/disincentives program, identification of key personnel, quality certifications, past performance, subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-9 (or a request for waiver if no subcontracting opportunities will be anticipated), and a firm-fixed-price quote for the following:  

BACKGROUND 

The U.S. Coast Guard currently  operates twenty  HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  CSD Pumps P/N A25400033-4B, (The following part numbers will be recognized as alternate part numbers under this award:  A25400033-4 OR a25400033-ABD, manufactured by Messier-Hispano-Bugatti, currently installed on these aircraft are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides, but is not limited to: an individual components historical record of repair or overhaul; tracking of component time (time since new (TSN)/time in service (TIS), time since overhaul (TSO), and mean time between failure (MTBF); component status; and physical location.

OBJECTIVE

The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair or overhaul CSD pumps for return to service, at the best value to the Government.  Repaired or overhauled pumps must meet the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s  (OEM) operational specifications in Accordance With (IAW) Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 29-50-10, rev. date 30 June 1992.  ACMS overhaul requirements for this component is 2500 hours.  

The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair.  First level repair, a “Return to Service” is considered as test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements in the most economical method (component time continues).  Second level repair “overhaul” would be required for units that have reached their overhaul time limit of 2500 hours, or have a time remaining of 800 hours or less.  A separate cost breakdown for parts listed in ‘Parts Breakout” in the “Description of Supplies or Services” will be required for both levels of service.  At a minimum these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror’s technical and cost proposal.  Offerors may propose additional levels of service.  

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to: trained personnel, required tooling, calibrated test equipment, CMM, OEM approved replacement parts, preservation and shipping.

The offeror’s responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work.

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center’s (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the chosen offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  

To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives, the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 

1.	Technical:

a.	Provide detailed work specifications for Level I and Level II repair of  CSD pump to return to service.

b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan.  Include any incentives or disincentives.

c.	Provide evidence of an ability to maintain a Quality System.

d.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, calibrated test equipment and fixtures to meet the OEM specifications.


2.	Past Performance:
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair or overhaul of similar or like 
	items.

b.	Provide points of contact for past performance documentation for the past two years.  Include reference’s name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.

3.	Pricing:

Provide a firm-fixed pricing schedule that shall include hourly labor rate and parts for repair or overhaul IAW CMM  29-50-10, revision date June 30, 1992,  and for “Breakout Parts” listed in “Description of Supplies or Services”.

4.	Definitions:

a.	Level I Repair:  inspection, repair and replacement of parts as necessary to return the unit to service in the best value to the Government method, which  does not zero out component time.
   
b.	Level II Repair:  considered as over and above a Level I Repair for units showing excessive degradation or have reached their service life of 1700 hours or greater since last overhaul.  A Level II Repair zeros the components’ time since overhaul .

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
