<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure the brand name Cell Biosciences Firefly 3000 instrument.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The NCI Antibody and Protein Purification Unit (APPU) has a need to provide high throughput capillary isoelectricfocusing analysis of clinical and basic research samples.  This technique allows for the activation pathway analysis of phosphoproteins using only a cognate antibody to the protein.  It also requires extremely low amounts of protein for the actual analysis and is amenable to cell aspirates and needle biopsies from patient samples.  The Firefly 3000 instrument shall be used for patient diagnostic laboratory clinical use and for supporting clinical and basic research by the APPU for CCR investigators.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the Firefly 3000 instrument capable of running 12 capillary focusing runs per cycle using a 96 capillary format.  The contractor shall also provide installation and training.</p>
<p>Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1.	Statute</p>
<p>Statute: 41 U.S.C. 253 (1) as set forth in FAR 13.106-(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1)</p>
<p>(b) Solicitation from a single source.</p>
<p>(2)	For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.</p>
<p>No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.</p>
<p>2.  Sole Source Justification:<br />The following salient characteristics apply to the Cell Biosciences Firefly 3000 instrument:</p>
<p>The instrument satisfying our requirements must meet the following specifications:</p>
<p>&bull;	An automated isoelectric focusing, protein concentration and nano-immunoassay system that uses 96, 5 cm long, 100 &mu;M inner diameter capillaries, with a proprietary inner coating that allows for the separation, capture and covalent immobilization of proteins from any species in a 400 nL volume, and subsequent immuno assay detection in the same vessel.</p>
<p>&bull;	The system must be capable of analyzing 96 cell lysate samples accessed from a chilled, standard 96 well plate with primary and secondary antibodies also accessed from a standard 96 well plate.</p>
<p>&bull;	The system must use fluorescently labeled pI standards and utilize proprietary software to calibrate each capillary and assign pI values to detected proteins.</p>
<p>&bull;	The immunoassays must use chemiluminescent detection and quantization of target proteins with limit of detection of 350 femtograms (approx. 5 attomoles) of DNAK in a 400 nL volume.</p>
<p>&bull;	The software should enable the user to define the samples and assays to be assigned and then automatically performs sample injection, separation, protein immobilization, immunoassay and chemiluminescent detection without further user involvement.  Post run analysis software must be capable of evaluating the experimental sample's chemiluminescent data and pI standard data to assign pI values to each identified peak and transferring data to a spread sheet.</p>
<p>&bull;	The instrument should have the capability of running samples equivalent of running protein samples from as little as 25 cells and get detailed information on the phosphorylation status of critical signaling proteins.</p>
<p>&bull;	The capillaries should be read by a -700 Backthinned CCD chip camera with a frame transfer of Dark counts at 0.004 electrons/sec and a read noise of 4 counts per read.</p>
<p>&bull;	The instrument should have a software controlled 2000 Watt electrodless UV lamp  with a broad UV output.</p>
<p><br />The Firefly 3000 capillary electrophoresis unit is the only known instrument capable of running 12 capillaries per cycle, 8 cycles/day.   The uniqueness of  this  instrument is the chemical bonding of the separated proteins to the wall of the capillaries at the cessation of the run prior to the immunological assay.  As this is newly innovated instrumentation there are no compatibility issues with existing instrumentation at the NIH.  The extreme sensitivity and high throughput capability also is unique to the Firefly 3000.  The Cell Biosciences Firefly 3000 is the only known instrument that is able to meet all of the above characteristics.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 26, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Please reference pre-solicitation number NCI-90056-MM on all correspondence.</p>

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12  Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) to use simplified acquisition procedures for commercial item.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.


Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

1.	Statute

Statute: 41 U.S.C. 253 (1) as set forth in FAR 13.106-(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1)

(b) Solicitation from a single source. 

(2)	For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

	No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.   


2.  Sole Source Justification:

This Aperio XT Scanner is a new purchase and will not be replacing old equipment.  The use of this equipment will improve quality assurance of slide scanning; improve file sharing for research and clinical use; and demonstrate significant benefits to the academic endeavors.  This technology offers the ability to view, analyze, and manage patient and research cases as digital images, and store the images in a virtual library for future retrieval.  The software (Spectrum Plus) will create an electronic teaching file for medical residents and researchers will have access to specific cases electronically, rather than the laborious task of retrieving and reviewing individual paraffin blocks and slides.  As expert pathology consultants for abnormal pathology cases from medical centers throughout the country and internationally, electronic images of cases reviewed from submitted hospitals can be returned to the originating facility.  Imaging slide sets for clinical trials allows investigators ease of access to their protocols (i.e. molecular profiling core currently uses this process for their case sets).

This scanner will also increase the efficiency of the NCILP through a reduction in sharing traditional glass slides, as well as collaborative uses.  The XT will offer the continuity with previous equipment, database interoperability, file structure and existing images in the Laboratory of Pathology (approximately 7,000 images to date).  Images stored in virtual library will have same file format as existing images in LP Tissue MicroArray Lab and by the NCI Molecular Profile Core.  The XT is the only platform that offers a single non-tiff image that is non-proprietary and can be analyzed by other commercially available packages.  The XT is the only scanning system with a real 20x objective and 40x objective.  It contains a web-based database (Spectrum Plus) and server capacity to share images, and it provides operator control of embedded meta-data including slide label images.  Other systems allow the collection of this information but do not have the capacity to block it from users and this is critical for confidentiality issues.

The instrument satisfying NCILPs requirements must meet the following salient characteristics: 

1)	 Imaging capabilities:  The scanner must:
 
1.1.	be capable of fully scanning both 1x3 and 2x3 slides,
1.2.	produce images with no discernible stitching artifacts,
1.3.	produce high quality images at 20x and 40x optical resolutions,
1.4.	produce images with an appropriate numeric aperture (at least 0.75), 
1.5.	be able to produce z-stack images, and
1.6.	produce self contained images in an accepted ISO format.
 
2)  High throughput:  The scanner must have the following characteristics:

2.1.	High capacity:  the scanner must be able to hold at least 120 slides in a given processing batch,
2.2. 	Hands free operation:  The scanner must be able to scan an entire batch of slides without user intervention, including finding the appropriate tissue area's and full multi-point auto-focus,
2.3.	Fault tolerant:  The scanner must be fault tolerant in its ability to handle difficult slides.  Should the scanner fail to scan a given slide in a processing batch, the scanner must be able to recover gracefully and complete the remainder of the batch without user interventions.  Additionally, once a batch is complete it should be clear to the operator which slides/s failed to scan properly.  The expected failure rate should be less than 5%,
2.4.	The scanner should be able to scan and have ready for viewing an area of 1.5cmx1.5cm in less than 2 minutes, and
2.5.	Random access:  Once a batch of slides has been scanned, the instrument must be capable of accessing the slides in a random access manner so that slides can be rescanned if needed.

3)  Research considerations:  Because the scanner will be used for both high throughput pathology 	material and research material, the following criteria must be met:

3.1.	Image analysis:  An import aspect of research pathology is image analysis.  The Instrument must ship with at least the ability to analyze histological material for nuclear, membranous and cytoplasmic staining,
3.2.	Image analysis must be able to be performed on the image server and be initiated by a remote user,
3.3.	Image analysis must be able to be initiated in a batch analysis fashion by a remote user, and
3.4.	Analysis results must be able to be exported for an entire project or batch in a group fashion by a remote user.
 	
4)  Server considerations: 
 	
4.1.	The scanner must store all its annotations on an external database with a published schema such that the database may be read from an outside application,
4.2.	All images generated must be the property of the NCILP and have no restrictions or requirement for annual licensing fees or any other fees in order to be viewed across the network, published or reproduced,
4.3.	New images must be able to be added to the server and cataloged into the database without the need of any operator intervention,
4.4.	The database (server) must be able to control individual access rights to images and data so that unauthorized access and changes are prevented,
4.5.	The database (server) must be able to organize and manage other image types (such as standalone cameras), documents, and data from other sources,
4.6.	The scanner must store all its annotations on an external database with a publish schema such that the database may be read from an outside application,
4.7.	New images must be able to be added to the server without the need of any operator intervention,
4.8.	The scanner must come with a full database management system capable of replacing our current pathology database.  To accomplish this, the system must at a minimum be capable of:

a)	organizing images into a hierarchy system representing our current pathology case system (multiple slides /case),
b)	handling multiple users with multiple user permissions based on passwords, and
c)	producing custom pathology reports.
   
5)	Digital Slide Viewing:  

5.1.	The scanned image must be immediately available for viewing following scanning without additional rendering or file conversion time,
5.2.	Image format should be industry standard TIFF/JPEG or TIFF/JPEG2000 compliant with TIFF6.0 standard,
5.3.	The digital image created by the scanner must allow the following functions:
a.  Smooth tracking and zoom,
b.  Smart Synchronization,
c.  Grid overlay,
d.  Efficient serving of the image over the web,
e.  Automatic color correction to standard using ICC profile,
f.  Image Quality enhancement for digital stain separation, adjustment, and recombination,
5.4.	The proposed solution must allow the collaborative sharing of the digital image in real time from various locations, and
5.5.	Images should be viewable locally and remotely utilizing a web-based browser system anywhere, anytime on any computer with such a web-browser.

6)	Digital Slide Management:

6.1)	The proposed solution must offer integrated image file management software that allows for logical digital slide organization, searching, and report creation,
6.2)	The digital image management software must be role-based to allow specific user profiles for access to certain functions only as appropriate,
6.3)	The proposed digital slide management software should offer an optional automatic TMA segmentation module,
6.4)	The proposed digital slide management software should offer an optional compliance module to track user activity and generate reports thereof,
6.5)	The proposed digital slide management software must offer GLP-compliance and HIPAA-compliance capability, and provide full update and access auditing capabilities,
6.6)	The proposed digital slide management software should use an industry-standard SQL database (e.g. Microsoft SQLServer) and should support a multi-site configuration, including the following attributes:
a.	The option for a single central database shared among all sites,
b.	Single database with authentication profiles and centralized auditing,
c.	Capability for digital slides to be scanned at multiple locations and cataloged into the central system automatically,
d.	Capability for digital slides optionally to be transferred from remote locations to central location for long-term storage and archival,
e.	Capability for remote sites to connect to central site with outbound connections only, requiring no firewall configuration changes,
f.	Industry-standard encryption of all PHI (protected health information) transmitted between remote sites and central server, and
6.7)	The proposed digital slide management software should be developed under FDA Quality System Regulations (QSRs) and should be part of an FDA-cleared system for one or more clinical indications.

7)  Image Analysis Capability:

The digital pathology solution proposed must offer automated image analysis capability that includes the following attributes:

a.	FDA cleared HER2, ER, and PR algorithms for immunohistochemical quantification,
b.	TMA parallel cell analysis,
c.	Open platform for the development of 3rd party algorithms,
d.	Direct interface to the management software for report generation, and
e.	An algorithm to automatically exclude unwanted areas.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole source agreement with the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI) for the purposes of providing services to organize and conduct a 1-day policy research and education seminar that would examine the interactions between workers compensation and SSAs disability programs.  Under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.500, the agency is soliciting from a single source.  NASI has been collecting and analyzing workers compensation state data for use by agencies, academicians, and various organizations and companies conducting research work in related areas since 1995.  In addition, NASI examines policy and procedural issues related to workers compensation programs and the interrelationship between those programs and other disability programs.  In order to systematically collect and analyze state data, NASI has organized and heads a Workers Compensation Steering committee comprised of the nations leading experts in workers compensation policy and practice.  This unique steering committee provides expertise needed to shape the data collection and review process, as well as the expertise needed to inform NASIs policy related discussions and analyses in the areas of disability and workers compensation.  As a result, NASI has the unique expertise to provide the most comprehensive national aggregates and state level estimates of workers compensation costs and benefits, as well as the mechanisms to readily provide the best high level research and analysis as a result of the data they have collected.  The seminar is to be conducted in the September/October 2009 timeframe.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The items specified above represent a follow on to previous contracts with CMC Electronics and specifications or drawings are not available to the Coast Guard.  The purposed contract action is for services for commercial items, which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or other costs incurred in response to this announcement. See Note 22. 
Notice for filing agency protests: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that an Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax:  (202) 475-3904. POC for this action is Theresa Alkeus, (252)334-5174.

<DESC><p>I. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</span></strong>: This Sources Sought synopsis facilitates CDC's market research efforts to determine an acquisition strategy for a new requirement described below. This is not a solicitation and thus proposals are not requested and will not be accepted. Please do not request to be added to a "bidders list" because the contracting officer will not create such a list since any resulting solicitation will be posted to FEDBIZOPS for all interested and eligible offerors to respond. There is no incumbent contractor for this new requirement.</p>
<p><br />II. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong>: The CDC solicited comments via a Request For Information (RFI) posted to FEDBIZOPS on November 21, 2008. The RFI included a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) to assess the potential health effects of environmental exposures to FEMA-provided temporary housing units and storm-damaged housing among children who resided in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Based upon comments received, CDC has prepared a final SOO (copy attached). The title of the contemplated acquisition is: Children's Health Study (CHS). Included as an attachment to this synopsis is a document titled: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions&nbsp;&amp; Answers to CHS RFI</span> provided in .pdf format. This document is the CDC's response to the numerous questions, comments and recommendations received in response to the aforementioned RFI.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />III. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Objective of Synopsis</strong></span>: Offerors interested in the contemplated acquisition are invited to submit a capability statement (in accordance with para. V. Capability Statement Preparation Instructions below) to demonstrate the depth and breadth of their professional and scientific capabilities to perform the services described in the attached SOO. The primary purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether or not adequate competition exists among small businesses (and other eligible socioeconomic entities described in FAR 19) to conduct a competitive set aside acquisition. Thus, small businesses, in particular, are encouraged to respond to this synopsis. Any solicitation and resulting contract awarded on the basis of a small business set aside will include Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting. This clause requires that "At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">IV. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key features of the contemplated contract</strong></span>:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Contract type: Cost Plus Fixed Fee - Completion Form;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Single Award;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Duration: Base Period: 2-year Feasibility Study<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Option: One, 6-year Full Study</p>
<p>V. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Capability Statement Preparation Instructions</strong></span> (Page limit: 20):<br />Prepare and submit the information below following the sequence in which they are listed:</p>
<p><br />1. Name and address of business and point of contact information (phone # and email address);</p>
<p><br />2. Identify your business size status relative to NAICS code: 541990 Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services $7.0M. The government will evaluate responses to this sources sought synopsis to determine the acquisition strategy (i.e. a "full and open" competition versus a competitive set aside authorized by FAR 19). Accordingly, offerors are requested to indicate any other applicable socio-economic business subcategory status (e.g. Qualified HUBZone Small Business, 8(a) certified small business, Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business).</p>
<p><br />3. Provide a one-page introduction of your company.</p>
<p><br />4. Discuss your experience, capabilities, resources (e.g., personnel, facilities, ability to subcontract services not otherwise available in-house), and technical knowledge for each of the following topics:</p>
<p><br />a. Designing and implementing large-scale (&ge;500 participants) epidemiologic studies of health effects related to environmental exposures (e.g., criteria air pollutants, pesticides, heavy metals, toxins);</p>
<p>b. Preparing a scientific study protocol and obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearances;<br /><br />c. Conducting a longitudinal study that involves identifying and tracking participants over time, from multiple locations across the US;</p>
<p>d. Using data management systems that track and consolidate information from the data collection tools and laboratories;<br /><br />e. Complying with federal regulations and policies regarding contractual procedures; human subjects protection; participant confidentiality; data security; and Section 508 compliance;</p>
<p>f. Conducting public relations, health education, and health communication related to complex epidemiologic studies and potentially sensitive environmental exposure issues.</p>
<p>5. Additional Information: Identify relevant examples of past and/or current experience and include a brief explanation of the nature of the work, labor skill mix used and dollar value. Such examples should relate to the "Study Objectives" listed in the attached draft SOO. For each example, identify what dollar value of the work was performed by in-house employees versus subcontractor or consulting personnel (the "dollar value" information is only required from small business respondents).</p>
<p><br />6. Submit response to the contracting officer via email: FTG7@cdc.gov not later than the response due date and time stipulated in this synopsis. FAX responses are not acceptable unless otherwise authorized.</p>
<p><br />7. This sources sought synopsis does not obligate the government and is submitted as market research for acquisition planning purposes. Offerors responding to this synopsis do so voluntarily and assume all costs incurred in preparing and submitting such response. This synopsis is not a solicitation and therefore formal proposals are neither requested nor required. Thus the CDC will reject any such proposals received in response to this sources sought synopsis.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought announcements are issued to assist the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in performing market research to determine industry interest and capability to obtain company demographics, benchmarking information and industry ideas for an acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought announcement is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) and at this time, no solicitation exists.

INTRODUCTION:   The Agencys mission is to safeguard the United States and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate and counter the threat and its effects. This mission dictates a diverse set of customers and unique mission requirements. The Agencys Enterprises requirements are equally diverse and unique.  

BACKGROUND:   The DTRA intends to award a firm fixed price contract for Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Support Services for the Office of the Chief of Staff.   

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) generally provides that any person has a right, enforceable in court, to obtain access to federal agency records, except to the extent that such records (or portions of them) are protected from public disclosure by one of nine exemptions or by one of three special law enforcement exclusions.  Taking effect on July 4, 1967, the FOIA firmly establishes an effective statutory right of public access to executive branch information in the federal government.

The purpose of the Privacy Act of 1974 is to balance the governments need to maintain information about individuals with the rights of individuals to be protected against unwarranted invasions of their privacy stemming from federal agencies collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of information about them.  The Act focuses on four basic policy objectives:

(1)	To restrict disclosure of personally identifiable records maintained by agencies.
(2)	To grant individuals increased rights of access to agency records maintained on themselves.
(3)	To grant individuals the right to seek amendment of agency records maintained on themselves upon showing that the records are not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.
(4)	To establish a code of fair information practices which requires agencies to comply with statutory norms for collection, maintenance, and dissemination of records?

The Department of Defense has directed through DoD Directives 5400.7-R (DoD Freedom of Information Act Program) and 5400.11-R (Department of Defense Privacy Program) policies and procedures for each Program.  Each Defense Agency is responsible for the processing of FOIA and Privacy Act requests for information which is under their purview.  

REQUIREMENTS:  DTRA intends to procure Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Support Services.   DTRA intends to issues a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Support Services at the headquarters in Fort Belvoir, VA.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking food suppliers interested in establishing pricing agreements for food supplied to the US Military forces via the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor Program.

MPAs will initially be used for contracts in support of Overseas bases, ships & deployed forces and then possibly for contracts in the United States at a later date.  The intent of any resulting agreements are to obtain the best pricing possible for the US Military War Fighters, considering good commercial practice (i.e. acceptable industry-standard) while assuring direct visibility of a products price.

<DESC>The office of Dederal Student Aid (FSA) of the Department of Education is seeking sources capable fof providing student enrollment data. See the attached draft Statement of Objectives for a description of the requirement. FSA desires to secure a single point of contact, which can provide the bulk (75%) of the student enrollment data required to support FSA programs.

The following is an overview of the requirment. Please see the attached SOO for full details. Questions, comments and suggestions are welcomed.


Student Enrollment Reporting

Since the passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, schools have been required to confirm and report to the Secretary the enrollment status of attending students who receive Federal loans.  This process is called Enrollment Reporting (formerly the Student Status Confirmation Report (SSCR)).  Schools report the enrollment status of  FFEL and Direct Loan recipients. This enrollment information updates the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) database and is reported weekly to the  Guaranty Agencies and the Direct Loan Servicer.    Because a students enrollment status determines deferment eligibility, grace periods, and repayment schedules, as well as governments payment of interest subsidies, Student enrollment reporting is critical for effective administration of Title IV loans.  

The accuracy of Title IV student loan records depends heavily on the accuracy of the enrollment information reported by schools and other program participants.  Schools should review, update, and verify student enrollment statuses and other data that appears on the roster file.  Schools should correct any returned errors that are identified by NSLDS.  Other program participants such as loan holder should report known changes to NSLDS.

A schools roster may include borrowers with enrollment statuses of:

F (full-time)
H (half-time)
L (less than half-time)
A (leave of absence)
G (graduated)
W (withdrawn)

Enrollment Reporting must be completed in a timely and accurate manner in order to maintain the effectiveness of the database.  Enrollment information must be reported whenever attendance patterns change for students to a degree that changes the students status of enrollment.  These changes include reduction or increases in attendance levels, withdrawals, graduations, or approved leaves-of-absence.  It is the schools responsibility, as participant in the Title IV aid programs, to monitor and report these changes to NSLDS.

The TIMCs objectives include (1) serving as the Command's focal point for the technical integration and interoperability of Space and Global Missile Defense Family-of Systems for joint and coalition warfighting; (2) serving as operational integrator for Battle Management Command and Control battlespace interoperating picture initiatives; and (3) focusing technology development and exploiting existing technologies and concepts to enhance and advance our current and future forces Space and Global Missile Defense warfighting capabilities.<BR>The TIMC largely funds its mission and efforts to meet its objectives through receipt of funding available through the Armys annual Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process.  The TIMC heavily relies on academia and the private sector to support the generation of technology ideas that fall within the scope of TIMCs mission and objectives, and meet Warfighter needs.  Proactive construction of POM input to the Department of Army requires multiple tasks, one of which includes envisioning concepts and technologies that would come together in the system engineering process to form a system. Thus, the TIMC requests space and missile defense technologies and concept information from academia, private and government elements. This information may be used to strengthen and perhaps expand TIMCs POM submission.  If successful in being awarded funding by the Army for the POM, the TIMC may compete contracts for development of the subject technologies.  Preparation for the FY 12 POM is now commencing.  Therefore, the USASMDC/ARSTRAT TIMC announces interest in receiving information on new research and development ideas for advanced and innovative concepts directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge for current and emerging science and technologies in integrated missile and cruise missile defense, Army space initiatives, and command and control.

<DESC><p>Special Notice DARPA-SN-09-18: Dynamic Prevention of Biofouling Proposer's Day Workshop, Workshop Date: March 12-13, 2009; REGISTRATION DEADLINE: March 6, 2009; TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Judah Goldwasser, DARPA/DSO, Email: Judah.Goldwasser@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm; Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dsobaa/
<p>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a Proposer's Day Workshop that will provide critical information on the program vision, the milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team to respond to a Broad Agency Announcement. This solicitation is specifically for innovative multidisciplinary research proposals in the area of dynamic prevention of biofouling (DyPOB). The DyPOB program vision is to replace the current generation of antifouling coatings that require biocides or foul-release coatings which need ship operation at significant speeds to be successful. DyPOB will investigate surfaces that are inherently impervious to biofouling for extended periods, effective even at zero or low velocities, are biocide free, durable for several years, and whose effectiveness does not degrade over the life expectancy of the coating/surface. Proposed research should offer innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, technology, materials, and performance. Specifically excluded is research that results primarily in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice and those that include the use of biocides in the coating require use or generate hazardous materials. The DyPOB Proposers' Day will facilitate the formation of teams with the necessary expertise to respond to the planned BAA.</p>
<p>The DyPOB Proposer's Day Workshop will be held at the Strategic Analysis Liberty Conference Center, 4075 Wilson Blvd., Suite 350, Arlington, VA, 22203. The goals of the teaming and information session are to: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the DyPOB program vision and goals; (b) explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this particular effort; and (c) encourage and promote teaming arrangements among potential organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the DyPOB program goals. The teaming and information session will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the session participants. Additionally, a teaming website will be provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at www.sainc.com/DyPOBTeaming.</p>
<p>Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas described in the forthcoming BAA will be critical to the success of the DyPOB program. DARPA will not be funding component technologies that address only a subset of the technologies listed in the DyPOB solicitation.</p>
<p>DyPOB Proposer's Day Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions during the poster session. Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location and lodging are given on the registration website at http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=642 (Password = dypob (all lower case)).</p>
<p>There is no fee for the DyPOB Proposer's Day Workshop. Registration is limited (maximum 100 people; 2 people per organization) by the venue capacity. The registration cutoff date is 4:00PM ET, March 06, 2009, and early registration is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Further administrative information is available from Ms. Jeaninne Gane, Jeaninne.Gane.ctr@darpa.mil. Additional technical information can be obtained from Dr. Judah Goldwasser, Judah.Goldwasser@darpa.mil. Please refer to the DyPOB Proposer's Day Workshop (DARPA-SN-09-18) in all correspondence. This announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office, Endangered Species Program, Sacramento, California, intends to award under FAR 6.302-1 Only One Source No Later Than 2/26/2009. USFWS requires field survey work, habitat assessment and inventory services which will enable the Service to collect information and conduct surveys on existing and restored habitat on the South Fork Kern River for the yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus)(YBCU). The work will assist the Service in determining the current status and range of the YBCU and if restoration efforts have been effective and determine appropriate habitat restoration techniques for future restoration efforts.  The Southern Sierra Research Station (SSRS) of Weldon, California is uniquely qualified to provide the proposed general biological services. Personnel of SSRS have conducted scientific research on birds of conservation concern, including the Yellow-billed Cuckoo, in the Kern River Valley for over 20 years. In addition, SSRS has conducted extensive Yellow-billed Cuckoo surveys and research in California, southern Nevada, and Arizona during the last 23 years. SSRS (specifically, Murrelet Halterman) has been instrumental in developing the current Yellow-billed Cuckoo survey protocol and methodologies, and continues to improve our understanding of this species' habitat and nesting requirements. The breadth of SSRS's experience gives them unique insight into the requirements of studying this elusive species.  SSRS is located in the Kern River Valley where the work will occur, and is intimately familiar with the area and the species involved in this study, having conducted similar studies and research efforts in the past. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC><p>Notice of Intent to Issue a Sole Source Contract
<p>Solicitation Number: GS11P08ZGC0129<br />Notice Type: Special Notice</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />Added: February 12, 2009<br />NAICS Code: 561210 Facilities Support Services. <br />Size Standard $35.5 million.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Services, National Capital Region, Washington, DC intends to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for a 12-month performance period from March 1, 2009, through February 28, 2010. The current contract, set to expire February 28, 2009, provides Commercial Facility Management Services (CFM) for the Internal Revenue Service at the New Carrollton Federal Building, 5000 Ellin Road, Lanham-Seabrook, Maryland 20706. GSA has started the process of soliciting a replacement contract, but has encountered major human resource obstacles. As a result, there is insufficient time for GSA to otherwise immediately procure these services without encountering a lapse and/or impairment of services. Therefore, this sole source extension is necessary to bridge the gap between the current contract and the new award, thereby ensuring the overlap of contract performance required for the achievement of a smooth transition and continuous high-level service.</p>
<p>Description of the work to be performed: The contractor is to furnish all material, labor, equipment, supervision and services necessary to perform full CFM for a twelve (12) month period for the New Carrollton Federal Building. Contractor will be responsible for full building management services and is fully responsible for the management, customer service, operation, mechanical maintenance, janitorial services, elevator operations and maintenance, snow removal, energy management, management of parking facilities, loading dock, trash facilities, utility systems and quality control and engineering of the facility and of the associated grounds with all necessary labor, materials, supplies, technical support and value engineering.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services. A lapse in service will have a highly detrimental effect on the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to provide its services to the public. This extension will provide services without disruption for the operation of the New Carrollton Federal Building, a three-building facility, by a firm that holds current security clearances and that is also familiar with the complexity of the facility and the equipment. Park Tower Metro View Management is the incumbent CFM contractor and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional 12-month performance period.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued. However, if a firm believes it can meet these requirements within the prescribed time frame, it may give notification via e-mail to Jerome Lofton, Contract Officer, at jerome.lofton@gsa.gov no later than February 27, 2009, 10:00 a.m., EST. The Government will review all responses, without prejudice; whether or not the Government initially determines that another firm is fully qualified to fulfill the requirements.</p>

<p>Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements</p>
<p>Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) (See Note I) entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I. (1) Long-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term (See Note ii) contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:(a) Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);</p>
<p>(b) Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:</p>
<p>-- High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)</p>
<p>-- Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)</p>
<p>-- Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation</p>
<p>(d) The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:</p>
<p>(1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;</p>
<p>(2) Favorable fingerprint results;</p>
<p>(3) Favorable credit report, if required; (See Note iii)</p>
<p>(4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and</p>
<p>(5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) (See Note iv) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). (e) Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the FBI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>(2) Short-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a.and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:</p>
<p>(a) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;</p>
<p>(b) Favorable fingerprint results;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Favorable credit report, if required; (See Note v) and</p>
<p>(d) Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.</p>
<p>(3) Intermittent Contractors:</p>
<p>An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.</p>
<p>(a) For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.</p>
<p>(b) Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.</p>
<p>(d) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.</p>
<p>(e) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>(4) An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.</p>
<p>(5) The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>I)FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf</p>
<p>ii) Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.</p>
<p>iii) For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.</p>
<p>iv) In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM's instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code "3" must be placed in block "B" of the "Agency Use Only" section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.</p>
<p>v) For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.</p>
<p>Security of Systems and Data, Including Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>a. Systems Security:</p>
<p>The work to be performed under this contract requires the handling of data that originated within the Department, data that the contractor manages or acquires for the Department, and/or data that is acquired in order to perform the contract and concerns Department programs or personnel.</p>
<p>For all systems handling such data, the contractor shall comply with all security requirements applicable to Department of Justice Systems, including by not limited to all Executive Branch system security requirements (e.g., requirements imposed by OMB and NIST), DOJ IT Security Standards and DOJ Order 2640.2E. The contractor shall provide DOJ access to and information regarding the contractor's systems when requested by the Department in connection with its efforts to ensure compliance with all such security requirements, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Department in such efforts. DOJ access shall include independent validation testing of controls, system penetration testing by DOJ, FISMA data reviews, and access by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General for its reviews. The use of contractor-owned laptops or other media storage devices to process of store data covered by this clause is prohibited until the contractor provides a letter to the Contracting Officer (CO) certifying the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Laptops must employ encryption using a NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 approved product;</p>
<p>2. The contractor must develop and implement a process to ensure that security and other applications software is kept up-to-date;</p>
<p>3. Mobile computing devices will utilize anti-viral software and a host-based firewall mechanism;</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall log all computer-readable data extracts from databases holding sensitive information and verify each extract including sensitive data has been erased within 90 days or its use is still required. All DOJ information is sensitive information unless designated as non-sensitive by the Department;</p>
<p>5. Contractor-owned removable media, such as removable hard drives, flash drives, CDs, and floppy disks, containing DJB data, shall not be removed from DOJ facilities unless encrypted using a NIST FIPS 140-2 approved product;</p>
<p>6. When no longer needed, all removable media and laptop hard drives shall be processed (sanitized, degaussed, or destroyed) in accordance with security requirements applicable to DOJ;</p>
<p>7. Contracting firms shall keep an accurate inventory of devices used on DOJ contracts.</p>
<p>8. Rules of behavior must be signed by users. These rules shall address at a minimum: authorized and official use; prohibition against unauthorized users; and protection of sensitive data and personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>9. All DOJ data will be removed from contractor-owned laptops upon termination of contractor work. This removal must be accomplished in accordance with DOJ IT Security Standard requirements. Certification of data removal will be performed by the Contractor's project manager and a letter confirming certification will be delivered to the CO within 15 days of termination of contractor work.</p>
<p>b. Data Security:</p>
<p>By acceptance of, or performance on, this contract, the contractor agrees that with respect to the data identified in paragraph a, in the event of any actual or suspected breach of such data (i.e., loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, access for an unauthorized purpose, or other unauthorized access, whether physical or electronic), the contractor will immediately (and in no event later than within one hour of discovery) report the breach to the DOJ CO and the contracting officer's technical representative (COTR). If the data breach occurs outside of regular business hours and/or neither the CO or the COTR can be reached, the contractor shall call the DOJ Computer Emergency Readiness Team (DOJCERT) at 1-866-US4-CERT</p>
<p>(1-866-874-2378) within one hour of discovery of the breach. The contractor shall also notify the CO as soon as possible during regular business hours.</p>
<p>c. Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement:</p>
<p>The contractor further certifies that it has a security policy in place that contains procedures to promptly notify any individual whose personally identifiable information (as defined by OMB) was, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached. Any notification shall be coordinated with the Department, and shall not proceed until the Department has made a determination that notification would not impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize national security. The method and content of any notification by the contractor shall be coordinated with, and be subject to the approval, of the Department. The contractor assumes full responsibility for taking corrective action consistent with the Department's Data Breach Notification Procedures, which may include offering credit monitoring when appropriate.</p>
<p>d. Pass-through of Security Requirements to Subcontractors (MAR 2008)</p>
<p>The requirements set forth in Paragraphs a through c above, apply to all subcontractors who perform work in connection with this contract. For each subcontractor, the contractor must certify that it has required the subcontractor to adhere to all such requirements. Any breach by a subcontractor of any of the provisions set forth in this clause will be attributed to the contractor.</p>
<p>Faith-based and Community-based organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.</p>
<p>Freedom of Information Act</p>
<p>The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and its amendments have resulted in an increasing number of requests to Federal Agencies for copies of Technical/Management and Business Proposals from other than Government sources.</p>
<p>The offeror should identify information in its Technical/Management and Business Proposals the offeror believes should be withheld from these sources, on the basis the proposals consist of "trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential" (exemption (b) (4) of the FOIA). This identification will assist in the decision by a responsible federal official to disclose or withhold the requested information.</p>
<p>If an offeror considers elements of its proposal to be exempt under FOIA, ensure the following notice is annotated on the title page of the proposal:</p>
<p>Elements of this document, as identified on individual pages, are considered by the submitter to be privileged or confidential trade secrets or commercial or financial information not subject to mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.&nbsp;The offeror must annotate each individual item it considers privileged or confidential under the FOIA exemption with the following notice: The data or information is considered confidential or privileged, and not subject to mandatory disclosure under the FOIA. All information in an offeror's proposal not designated may be subject to automatic public disclosure if it is requested under the FOIA. It must be emphasized that under the FOIA no information is automatically exempt from public disclosure. However, no disclosures will be made without careful evaluation, giving due regard to the need for safeguarding material considered privileged or confidential by the offeror. It is Department of Justice policy to withhold whenever possible material that is genuinely privileged or confidential.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to acquire commercial services necessary to maintain the fire alarm and suppression systems connected to warehouse T 214 at the Defense National Stockpile Center (DNSC) storage site in New Haven IN. 

This suppression system is over 50 years old.  It is a water delivery system with pump driven deployment when activated.  Static pressure is maintained by a 500,000 gallon high tank located on the property.  Supply water is delivered first from the high tank and then from two 1,000,000 gallon reservoirs.  All three reserves are refilled from an in ground well pump.  Suppression is delivered through 10 cast iron pipes that run underground to five riser houses on each of the five dry pipe equipped warehouses connected to the system; and directly to the maintenance building that has wet pipe distribution.  The system is supported by an ADT addressable wireless alarm that monitors air pressure and water flow.  The alarm system is approximately five years old and was acquired through a lease/purchase agreement.

DNSC only occupies one of five warehouses on this site, warehouse T 214, and expects to vacate that building within the 2009 calendar year.  The property is owned by the General Services Administration (GSA).  It is excess to their inventory and will be sold once DNSC operations on the site are completed.

In its present condition, two of four delivery pumps are inoperable.  All of the zones that support vacant warehouses have been shut down.  The system has been serviced by a series of commercial contractors since 1998.  

This RFP is set for full and open competition and should be priced IAW the contract line item format shown in the solicitation.  FAR 12 and 13 procedures, DNSC intends to award without discussions, but the Government reserves the right to hold discussions if needed.

(v)  This requirement is for The United States Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Center Microbiology/Molecular laboratory which requires a Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Genotyping system using Analyte Specific Reagents (ASR) to conduct HCV genotype testing. Hepatitis C virus infection is relatively prevalent amongst the US veteran population and is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Determination of viral load and viral genotype (there are 6 main HCV genotypes) are routinely used laboratory guides to clinical management. Our laboratory performs viral load determination and genotyping assays in-house and serves as a reference lab to the VA system. Existing genotyping methodologies require prior PCR amplification of viral nucleic acid, which is most commonly and most efficiently, accomplished using the very same PCR reaction that is also used for viral load determination in the performing laboratory.  We have performed HCV genotyping for many years, however, the current procedure uses components that are classified as RUO (Research Only Use) by the US FDA. We have to change the methodology for a variety reasons, one of which is we cannot continue the RUO methodology without greatly increased cost and complexity, since the current methodology does not work off of the PCR products of our newly implemented Roche HCV viral load assay. (vi) REQUIREMENT AND QUANTITIES: The genotyping estimated annual volume is 230 tests.This requirement consists of one (1) line item to perform the services described in this solicitation.

The items specified above represent a follow on to previous contracts with CMC Electronics and specifications or drawings are not available to the Coast Guard.  The purposed contract action is for services for commercial items, which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or other costs incurred in response to this announcement. See Note 22. 
Notice for filing agency protests: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that an Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax:  (202) 475-3904.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

    (v) Others similar interests.

<DESC><p>1.What details are available for the video source? <br />= Near real-time full color streaming video.
<p>2.The RFP implies that there is a small PC, running Windows XP. Please confirm that this PC is not a part of this procurement and if the contractor requires access to it one would be made available as GFE.<br />= Correct. There is no PC that is part of this HMD procurement. Once a company is awarded a contract and is deemed a need to require access to such computer, we will provide one as GFE but one will not be provided at this time.</p>
<p>3.Please confirm that the small PC is not a part of the weight budget for the HMD. <br />= That is also correct. Small PC is not part of the weight budget.</p>
<p>4.Would the HMD be the primary (or only) display for that PC? <br />= It could be used as a primary display (someone storing their computer in a pocket or a backpack), but the computer will also have a separate display.</p>
<p>5.What ports are available on this PC? <br />= The Small Wearable Computer is still in Source Selection and therefore the specifics cannot be released at this time.</p>
<p>6.Are any standard video sources available (S-Video, HDMI, Composite, VGA - PC Monitor cable)? <br />= Standard VGA</p>
<p>7.What is the desired refresh rate or frame rate of the display?<br />= There is no standard desired refresh rate. HMD will be running video and should be able to support the video feed and function properly.</p>
<p>8.Given the light splash requirement, please confirm that the HMD display is a non-see-through display.<br />= There is a light splash requirement and a "minimizing obstruction to the user's FOV" requirement. Any product that meets these and other requirements will be considered a viable product.</p>
<p>9.What is the power budget for the system? <br />= 2.5 Watts</p>
<p>10.Is contractor responsible for supplying battery packs or power solutions?<br />= Contractor is responsible for power solution for proposed HMD. As this product will be utilized by our combat forces, lightweight and easy usability is preferred.</p>
<p>11.Is there a US Government alternative power pack or power solution that can be made available as GFE?<br />= See Question 10.</p>
<p>12.What amount of power consumption corresponds to the 72 hours continuous use if existing power supplies are used?<br />= Power is being supplied via the laptop. The device should operate off of that 2.5W power draw from the laptop continuously. The HMD should not overheat and shut off during that 72 hour duration.</p>
<p>13.In Attachment 1: In the Head-Mounted Display: Characteristics/Considerations - Capabilities section there is a desire for a "Computing system control of mouse type functions is desired". We view this desire as being separate of the HMD just as a monitor is separate from a mouse. Please specify (orbital, track point, two buttons, three buttons, USB, PS/2) your preference for such a handheld mouse.<br />= This is a "desired" capability.</p>
<p>14.In Attachment 1: In the Head-Mounted Display: Characteristics/Considerations there is a preference for "One USB connection for both power and video preferred". Please specify what driver or standard required from the computer to allow for power and video over the same USB connection.<br />= The driver or connection will be USB 2.0 or higher.</p>
<p>15.What is the required distance of the cable between the computer and the HMD?<br />= Desired length would be roughly 4.5 feet.</p>
<p>16.In Attachment 1: In the Head-Mounted Display: Characteristics/Considerations it states "Must be able to connect to currently deployed computing devices". Please provide the list of currently deployed computing devices.<br />= Currently, the fielded computer is the CF-19 Toughbook. The Small Wearable Computer is in source selection and thus cannot be commented on; however, the connections will not be different from the connections to the CF-19.</p>

<p>Basis for Award: An Award will be made to the contractor who is determined to offer the Best Value based on price, past performance, and technical aspects.

<DESC>The Government has become aware that several of the workstations have become outdated since our original Market Survey.  We are in the process of reassessing our need and determining which products are available which will meet our need.  As this assessment will not be completed this week in time to amend this combined synopsis/solicitation prior to the original due date of 20 Feb 2009, Solicitation N61339-09-T-0011 is hereby cancelled.  Once we have determined what currently available workstations will fulfill our need, we will resolicit the new requirements for the 20H5 Rehost Workstations.

INTRODUCTION

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Directorate of Subsistence has established a Subsistence Prime Vendor Program for subsistence and food related items. A Subsistence Prime Vendor is a business concern that functions as a purchaser's primary source for specified classes of food and food-related products.  It owns and maintains an inventory of subsistence and food related items manufactured by various suppliers which are delivered to the customer upon order.  The DSCP Directorate of Subsistence is awarding contracts to Subsistence Prime Vendors in a given geographical region.  Each Subsistence Prime Vendor will be the primary supplier of food and food-related products for DSCP authorized customers in a given geographic region and such Subsistence Prime Vendors chosen by DSCP will furnish such authorized customers with the majority of their normal day-to-day requirements for food and food-related items.
Manufacturer Pricing Agreements are desired by the Department of Defense because they provide standard fair and reasonable fixed product prices that may be used in any DSCP contract.

PRICING

1.	(a)	The MPA Holder shall submit their offered prices by SKU or manufacturer code for FOB Origin/Point of Manufacture.  Only when the MPA Holder has published National FOB destination pricing, and such pricing is accepted by DSCP in lieu of FOB origin pricing, may FOB Destination prices be used.  When the MPA Holder has Exclusive Distributor Contracts or Central Distribution Warehouses, such pricing may also be considered on a case-by-case basis in lieu of FOB Origin/Point of Manufacture pricing.   The MPA price offered DSCP is at least equal to the Companys established tier, bracket, or other method of pricing employed for like or similar customers as DSCP.   In any event and for any or no reason, the prices offered herein may not be accepted by DSCP.
		(b)	The MPA Holder authorizes and consents to allow the Subsistence Prime Vendor to distribute its products, as herein described, to DSCP authorized customers at the price set forth in this MPA.    The DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor contractor shall use the MPA price for any item in effect at the time of purchase from the MPA Holder. The MPA Holder shall not provide a National Allowance Pricing Agreement (NAPA) discount to any DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor  contractor where use of Manufacturer Pricing Agreements are required in the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor contract.

		(c)	The MPA Holder unit of sale individual line item approved for inclusion herein (case, box, each, etc.) represents the shipper quantity the MPA Holder agrees to sell to any DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor for the purpose of distribution to DSCP authorized customers.  The MPA Holder may impose minimum order quantities to the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor or DSCP authorized customer commensurate with commercial practice (i.e. acceptable industry-standard), however, not more than a pallet load minimum.  
		(d)	The MPA Holder shall invoice the manufacturer price as listed in the Manufacturer Pricing Agreement Product Pricing Schedule, Attachment 1, as a separate line element on the invoice apart from transportation, marking, unitization, etc. requirements stipulated by the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor or its agent ordering the product.

		(e)	Initial pricing at time of agreement signing and for any new  products added will require submission of both the word document attachment 1, Section A and the Excel submission attachment 1, Section B.  Subsequent price changes to existing MPA prices will only require the submission in Excel as specified in attachment 1, Section B.  The MPA prices of items may be adjusted no more frequently than monthly.  The change effective dates will be the first Monday in any given month.  Adjustments will be submitted in an Excel file to the MPA Team by email to Ms. Joanne Bonese, MPA Contracting Officer: Joanne.Bonese@dla.mil  no later than 15 working days exclusive of Federal Holidays days prior to its effective date.  In the event of uncontrollable circumstances such as a national emergency, natural disaster, crop failure, etc. more frequent adjustments may be considered.

		(f)	For a period of two years following the close of the Calendar Year in which prices were offered to DSCP for products covered by this MPA, DSCP reserves the right to request documentation from the MPA Holder demonstrating DSCPs MPA price is at least equal to the Companys established tier, bracket, or other method of pricing employed for like or similar customers as DSCP.  Such documentation shall include any and all factors comprising price offers that serve to make up the prices or ultimately may have an effect on the prices offered to DSCP by the MPA Holder under this MPA.  MPA Holder shall explain their Companys pricing method (see Representations and Certifications paragraph 8) in sufficient detail to allow a DoD auditor to use the statement as the framework for a MPA price audit.

		(g)	The MPA Holder may offer any other incentive pricing, including additional discounts for DSCP customer purchases made at various trade shows.  Any value added services offered by the MPA Holder will be provided at no additional cost to DSCP or its customers.

PRODUCT
2.	(a)	The products submitted on the MPA shall conform to the manufacturer's standard commercial specifications unless otherwise specified in within the governing DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor contract.  Packaging and packing shall be to a degree of protection to preclude damage to the contents and/or containers under normal shipping conditions and handling and which conforms to normal commercial practices.  Product labeling should represent the manufacturers, or private labeler's standard commercial markings.  Packaging, packing and marking shall be in conformance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

		(b)	The MPA Holder shall deliver products exactly as ordered by the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor and represented in the MPA. Unilateral substitutions by the MPA Holder are not authorized. 
(c)	DSCP gives no guarantee that any quantities will be purchased under the MPA by DSCP, the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor or its authorized customers.  DSCP may issue MPAs to other firms supplying the same generic types of items.  In the event that both a manufacturer and a regular dealer request MPAs for the same item(s), MPAs shall be issued to all responsible firms provided their pricing is found to be fair and reasonable and each firm is capable of supplying the proposed items.  Estimated requirements are not available.  The issuance of a MPA in no way binds DSCP or the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor to purchase any of the products listed in the MPA.
(d)	DSCP authorized Military customers are responsible for selecting the items (price and other factors considered).  Questions regarding item selection should be directed to the individual authorized customers foodservice headquarters. 
(e)	Product code dating and shelf life requirements for the products listed on this MPA shall be consistent with good commercial business practices and standards. 
(f)	The MPA Holder standard commercial warranties shall apply to all commercial products listed in this MPA. 

(g)	National distribution and pricing is preferred.  The MPA Holder may choose to offer products on a restrictive basis (limited to a designated group of customers) if economic or business process constraints prohibit national pricing or distribution.  An individual MPA Holder and the items contained therein can be either national or restrictive in scope.  Both types of MPAs, national and restrictive, provide the MPA Holder the option of establishing incentive pricing.  Restrictive MPAs may be rejected, if in DSCP's sole opinion, the effect would be to unfairly exclude the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendors or DSCP authorized customers access to product or to fair and reasonable prices; or to prevent free and open competition among MPA Holders for the same or similar items, or for any or no reason.

MILITARY READINESS

3	(a)	The primary function of all DSCP logistic support initiatives is the maintenance of military preparedness in peacetime and war.  DSCP's Subsistence Prime Vendors have a critical role in ensuring that this absolute requirement is satisfied.  The MPA Holder shares in this responsibility.  The DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor contracts may contain clauses which obligate the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor to respond to high volume, short suspense material requests in support of military "surges".  Where these surge clauses are in effect, the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor has been provided line item specific information regarding product identification, ordering quantities, and required delivery dates.  In most instances the material quantities required to meet the military's immediate needs are far in excess of normal peacetime usage, and acceptable order ship time may be expressed in terms of hours. 

 		(b)	The DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor shall consult with and advise the MPA Holder when it has been determined that they represent a source for surge sensitive, readiness items.  The DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor will notify the MPA Holder of the projected quantities involved, as well as the necessary delivery time frames, and develop mutually acceptable surge support arrangements.  This coordination must take place in advance of actual surge execution in order to ensure that the requisite supply and response capabilities are firmly established. The MPA Holder shall work in concert with the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor to ensure that material support plans accurately reflect the capabilities and capacities of both parties. 

		(c)	This will include tests of these capabilities and capacities.  The ultimate goal is the maximization of product availability in the quantities and time frames required by the military services.  The MPA Holder who declines to enter into cooperative partnerships with any DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor for the expressed purpose of supporting the military's readiness requirements, or fails to respond to actual surge orders in accordance with previously established and agreed upon support parameters, may jeopardize its current market standing with the military.  It is likely that military logisticians and practitioners will configure peacetime product selections to closely mirror the material support they receive under contingency conditions.  

		(d)	The MPA Holder shall provide all reasonable cooperation when unusual requirements arise.  Unusual requirements may include, for example, natural disasters, national emergencies or other situations that create a surge in requirements.




BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS

	4.	(a)	The DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor will establish a business relationship with the MPA Holder if and when the holders product is selected for use by the Military customer or Subsistence Prime Vendor.  This relationship does not require any Military customer or DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor to use the MPA Holders MPA products.  This business relationship shall be consistent with the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor's good, commercial (i.e., acceptable industry-standard) business practices.  
		(b)	The MPA Holder shall be responsible for negotiating stocking requirements with the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor.  

	
CANCELLATIONS / MODIFICATIONS

	5. 	(a)	The MPA and its prices shall remain in effect until the MPA is canceled.  The MPA Holder may request changes to the MPA to delete or add products, offer price reductions and increases, or make other revisions.  All other information and regulatory requirements applicable to the original MPA will apply to any change/modification.  If any of the MPA Holder's responses to the required representations/certifications in the MPA change at any time after the MPA has been approved, the MPA Holder must immediately notify DSCP of such changes. The original agreed conditions will remain in effect until approved by DSCP.
		(b)	The MPA will remain in effect from the date of the joint signing of the MPA.  It may be modified or cancelled at any time by mutual consent of the parties hereto or by either party by providing 30 days advance written notification to the other party.  In addition, the MPA may be terminated by DSCP immediately for causes including but not limited to, any of the following: 

(i) Debarment or suspension of the MPA Holder.
(ii) Failure by the MPA Holder to agree to any deletion, amendment or addition to the MPA which is required by statute, Executive Order, the Federal Acquisition Regulation or other applicable Regulation.
(iii) DSCP secures documentation that the MPA pricing is not the MPA Holders established tier, bracket, or other method of pricing employed for like or similar customers as DSCP
(c)	All modifications to this MPA shall be in writing, and shall be signed by the DSCP Contracting Officer and the authorized representative of the MPA Holder, except for administrative modifications, which may be issued unilaterally.

(d)	Unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties hereto and incorporated in a Modification, no deletion, cancellation, addition, revision, or partial/total termination of this MPA shall affect any order issued prior to such deletion, cancellation, addition, revision or termination.  All orders issued during the effective period of this MPA shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the MPA at the time the order was issued.

(e)	The DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor is authorized to sell off residual stocks of product that have been deleted from the MPA program.  This is intended to provide the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor the means to reduce inventory and to afford DSCP authorized customers continued access to on-hand balances while they evaluate the availability of alternate equivalent items.  During this period, the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor price offered to the DSCP authorized customer may not exceed the MPA price in effect at the time of the deletion.  The MPA Holder shall honor the pre-existing MPA product price for inventory purchased by the DSCP Subsistence Prime Vendor prior to the date such product was deleted from the MPA program.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

<DESC>The following is an additional clarification to Question 1 released in the previous announcement for the Request for Qualifications for Solicitation No. 1443N2000090400.  The original question and response is provided below for your reference.
Question 1: Under Submittal Requirements, NPS asks for "a completed SF 330 for each firm" and "a Team Standard Form 330".  So assuming we have 4 subcontractors, this would mean we would have to provide individual SF 330s for us and the 4 subs, as well as a team SF 330 for the entire team (i.e., a total of 5 SF 330s).  Please confirm the number of SF 330s you are requesting.
Response 1: Based upon the number of subcontractors you list and yourself as prime, the five SF 330s sounds correct.  Your firm's SF330 would serve as the team one, identifying your firm as the prime and the subcontractors, and then each subcontractor would have an SF 330 as well. 
Further ClarificationIt is expected that the subcontractors would provide a completed Part II of the SF 330 (to be included with the Prime contractor's proposal) and other information for Part I of the SF 330, if applicable, such as resumes for Section E, etc.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR), Naval Air Warfare and Weapons Department (ONR 35) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for conduct of basic research in technology areas relevant to rotorcraft. As basic research, proposed projects should develop new scientific knowledge, improve theoretical understanding, and provide a basis for advances in rotorcraft technology. Research topics should focus on basic scientific issues inspired by rotorcraft technology needs and having the potential for making significant contributions towards Navy research thrusts and DoD goals and missions. Technology transfer and the partnering of this research with the US rotorcraft industry, U.S. Navy, other Government organizations (e.g., U.S. Army, NASA, FAA) and other academic institutions are encouraged.

The proposed research should emphasize innovative, creative basic research rather than application of existing technologies. Projects should not be directed at specific aircraft or systems, and need not offer immediate or specifically identifiable improvements in rotorcraft technology. Projects that merely apply engineering methods to develop or evaluate unusual vehicle configurations or components are not of interest under this Announcement. Although software development per se is not a goal of this announcement, projects demonstrating new methods via their software implementation will be considered.

The purpose of this Modification/Amendment is to attach Amendment 0006.

<DESC>ONEP Geographic Information System (GIS) Technical Assistance

POC John Kusnierek, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  ONEP Geographic Information System (GIS) Technical Assistance.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Bureau des Marches, Direction Approvisionnement et Marches, Office National de lEau Potable, 6 BIS, Rue Patrice Lumumba, Rabat, Morocco, Tel: (212) 37 70 22 59, Fax: (212) 37 72 10 30, email : nhimmi@onep.org.ma.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance for ONEP Geographic Information System (GIS)

Founded in 1972, ONEP is the main producer of drinking water, producing 80% of the national production.  ONEP is a public company and is responsible for the countrys potable water supply, as well as for wastewater treatment and recycling.   Subsequently, ONEP is charged with the management of drinking water and wastewater networks as well as watershed protection zones.  

Until recently, ONEP has tended to manage the areas of urban water supply, rural water supply, and wastewater treatment as separate and unrelated areas.  As water/wastewater management becomes increasingly more important in Morocco, the need on ONEPs part for an integrated, enterprise-wide approach is becoming increasingly evident.  Effective water resource management requires an in-depth understanding of the location, timing and amount of water used, and GIS technology can provide an essential platform in which to analyze and display this type of information, to make better-informed decisions about management and allocation, and to improve long-range planning.

ONEPs core operations would substantially benefit from a new, GIS-supported, unified approach to its activities, particularly in the following areas:
Land usage as it applies to ONEP land (for example: land associated with treatment plants, ONEP pipeline rights-of-way) 
Water resources (technical and administrative data, quality, etc.)
Watershed protection zones (both physical and environmental aspects)
Drinking-water networks (production; rural drinking-water supply; urban distribution)
Wastewater networks (including drinking-water purification plants)
Commercial aspects (customer management, billing, etc.)

Full implementation of an integrated, enterprise-wide GIS solution would yield for ONEP better data processing and management, a reduced cost of data generation and utilization as well as improved decision making and communication.  The technologies are similar to those in widespread use throughout the international water industry, and such a system would modernize and integrate data management to improve ONEPs activities.  The implementation of modern GIS-based information for water management in Morocco is essential in order for ONEP to achieve its corporate objectives in a competitive 21st century environment.   

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $385,876 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 p.m. NOON, March 27, 2009 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<a href="mailto:charlene.duncan@va.gov">VA-260-09-RQ-0212 Gr. Ambulance Services, LaGrande, Oregon</a>
<DESC>The Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center (hereinafter known as the VAMC) intends to establish a blanket purchase agreement with the City of LaGrande, Oregon, for ground ambulance services for Advance Life Support (ALS) and Basic Life Support (BLS) transport for the beneficiaries of the VAMC, Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), LaGrande, Oregon.  In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) a determination of only one source reasonably available is on file.  Services shall be provided 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  The services required are for the general LaGrande, OR, area.  The vehicles, personnel and services rendered will conform to all federal, state and local statues, rules and regulations; including, but not limited to the state of Oregon rules and statutes promulgated by the state of Oregon, Department of Human Services at http://egov.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/ems/rules.shtml; and all local codes, laws, regulations, rules and statutes.  The Contractor must be licensed as both an advanced and basic life support ambulance service by the state of Oregon to provide Emergency Medical Services. The Contractor must maintain licensure/certification with the state of Oregon, throughout the life of the agreement. License/certification lapses or expiration are grounds for termination of the agreement or discontinuance of further ordering from the Contractor.  The Contractor shall perform required services in accordance with the standards of the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services, established principles and ethics of the medical profession established by the American Medical Association (AMA) and American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). The VAMC and the Contractor are required to comply with all of the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, as well as all applicable VHA regulations, which are obtainable at http://www.hipaa.org/ and http://www1.va.gov/vhapublications/.  The Contractor shall ensure that the following personnel (Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), Paramedic, Non Emergency Attendant/ Drivers) performing services required under this agreement are properly licensed and fully trained in the use of the vehicle and equipment that will be used in the carrying out services performed under this agreement.  Throughout the effective period of this agreement, the Contractor shall possess insurance coverage in the minimum amounts to satisfy VAAR clause 852.237-71, Indemnification and Insurance, or state of Oregon requirements, whichever are higher.  Any lapse in required coverage could result in discontinuance of further ordering.  Prior to the start of performance the Contractor must submit to the Contracting Officer their certificate of insurance coverage evidencing required levels.  JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.  1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 2.  Description of Action:  This is a justification for other than full and open competition for the establishment of a Blanket Purchase Agreement for the procurement of ground ambulance services in the vicinity of LaGrande, Oregon, with the City of LaGrande. 3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  The VA is in need of providing eligible beneficiaries with medical transport between the LaGrande CBOC and other locations within the vicinity of LaGrande, Oregon.  Both Basic Life Support and Advanced Life Support care must be provided.  The provider and personnel must be licensed and qualified in accordance with state requirements to provide the service.  The provider and personnel are required to comply with all HIPAA requirements and the standards promulgated by the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services. 4.  Statutory Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b) and 13.501(a). 5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  There are private providers of ambulance services available in some geographic regions; however, there are none that have an office local to LaGrande, Oregon, challenging efficiency, cost and response time. 6.  Actions to Promote Competition:  A notice of intent to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with the City of LaGrande will be posted to FedBizOpps.  A BPA can be established with any qualified service provider willing and able to provide services in the vicinity of LaGrande, Oregon. 7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government over five years is $300,000.  This figure is based on historical data of payments made at the Medicare rate for these services in this area. 8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  The Contracting Officer has discussed the possibility of expanding services to more rural areas with private ambulance providers. 9.  Other Considerations:  Not applicable. 10.  List of Sources:  City of LaGrande, Oregon. 11.  Statement of Actions to Remove Barriers to Competition:  The only barrier to competition in the rural areas of the USA is lack of demand.  Based on the nature of the service, the only way to increase demand in rural USA is to re-distribute the population.
