<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has a sole source requirement for maintenance of SPSS Base; SPSS Regression; SPSS Advance; and SPSS Tables. SPSS 13.0 provides a broad range of capabilities for the entire statistical analysis process. SPSS can generate decision-making information quickly using powerful statistics, understand and effectively present results with high-quality tabular and graphical output, and share results with others using a variety of reporting methods, including secure Web publishing. SPSS is a modular, tightly integrated, full-featured product line for the analytical process planning, data collecting, data access, data management and preparation, analysis, reporting, and deployment. The purpose of this procurement is to renew for one year the maintenance agreement, which includes free upgrades to major releases, when and if developed, for the SPSS software. SPSS is the sole source provider of SPSS Product Maintenance. SPSS Product Maintenance includes toll free technical and e-mail support upgrades for the maintenance period of one year from the calendar date of the software acquisition. Maintenance is required to leverage the substantial investment made by the government. Upgrades allow our organization to stay up to date with the latest software improvements that SPSS develops. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. There is no solicitation available for this requirement.  This requirement will be awarded pursuant to FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions on February 11, 2009 no later than 3:00 PM EST. Questions are acceptable via e-mail at kim.freeze@atf.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau National Processing Center (NPC) in Jeffersonville, Indiana, intends to award as a sole source action in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13 a purchase order for CCTV Security equipment to extend an existing system.  This notice documents and incorporates provisions and clauses as those in effect through FAC 2005-29 dated January 19, 2009.  The NAICS is 561621 and the size standard is $12.5M.  The Census Bureau intends to make a sole source purchase to Applied Audio Video (AAV) of Louisville, Kentucky, to provide and install a Toshiba DVR, various Pelco CCTV equipment, and misc. electrical cables, boxes, and hangers.  The total cost is est. to be between 25K and 100K.  Davis-Bacon wage rates apply for the installation and SCA rates apply for maintenance and technical support.  These items are being added to an existing Security CCTV system that was originally obtained via Dept. of Commerce Contracts SA130107CN0029 and SE130108SE0028 and awarded to AAV.  These agreements provided for the provision and installation of the original system and the current coverage for maintenance and technical support.  The extension is being acquired in accordance with FAR 6.302, which permits sole source acquisitions in the case of a follow-on contract when award to any other source may result in duplication of costs to the Government and unacceptable delays.  Therefore, it is determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to award to AAV the extension of the existing CCTV system.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  No solicitation exists.
