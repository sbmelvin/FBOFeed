IAW FAR 8.405-6, citing 40 U.S.C. 50 I , Limited sources justification andapproval, the acquisition is conducted under the authority of the MultipleAward Schedule Program.s. NetApp is the leading manufacturer of network attached storage (NAS) andstorage area networks (SAN) appliances and is already operational/in-use inthe EUR Bureau. Our in-house engineers have already been trained andhave experience on the NetApp products and our mission critical data isalready in the NetApp format. New units need to be NetApp appliances inorder to complete our storage and disaster recoveryrequirements/operations.6. Using the procedures except as required by 8.405-2(d), the ordering activityhas concluded that the order represents the best value and results in thelowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features,administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs. Although GSAhas already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing, ordering activities mayseek additional discounts before placing and order. The price under theGSA Schedule remains constant and unchanged. Therefore, the ratesoffered, under this acquisition is considered fair and reasonable.<BR><BR>7. Market Research was conducted to identify potential vendors of the NetAppproducts on GSA Advantage. FCN Technology Solutions offers theseproducts and has authority to provide GSA schedule quotes on these items.FCN Technology Solutions has provided a preliminary quote and willparticipate in the FEDBID reverse auction.8. Utilizing any other brand than NetApp is simply not feasible in this situation.The office is simply replacing older units with newer units and ones that mayhave more capacity. The data stored on the current devices must be moved tothese devices and will only work on this product line. Furthermore, theengineers are trained on this product line. Additionally, NetApp is the onlyproduct line that is compatible with the office's current storage and DisasterRecovery plans.9. There arc no plans at this point to transition to a different system.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a special notice that a modification has been issued on contract W912HQ-08-C-0040 using American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 funds.  This contract modification was not issued as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed contract.  As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<BR><BR>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT MODIFICATION THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE:  This is a R&D type contract in support of SERDP and was issued on contract W912HQ-08-C-0040.  Cost-reimbursement type contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost-reimbursement arrangement.  In addition, the contractor's accounting system has been deemed adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient method and cost controls are used.<BR> <BR>Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) project number SI-0823 entitled Energy Efficient and Renewable Energy for DoD Installations, falls within the topic area of Landfill Gas Energy Capture.  The current contract is modified to add incremental funding in the amount of $450,451.00.  Additional work is also added to the contract to upgrade a 30kW microturbine with catalytic oxidizer and establish additional demonstrations.  The total amount of the additional work is $1,503,056.00.  The period of performance is extended from 07 Sep 2011 to 07 Jul 2012 to cover the additional work.<BR><BR>The contractor information is as follows:<BR>Southern Research Institute DUNS 006900526.<BR>2000 9th Street Avenue South<BR>Birmingham, AL 35205-2708

GENERAL:  This is a non-personnel services contract to provide Initial Outfitting and<BR>Transition Facilities Support Services (IO&TFSS) for new healthcare facility and medical research laboratory construction and renovation projects to support immediate (FY10) of the Army Medical Department (AMEDD).  The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein.  Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government.<BR><BR>1.1   OVERALL GOAL: To award a single corporate contract or multiple regional contracts that provide total turn-key project support for equipping and transitioning the staff and patients associated with the FY10 healthcare construction projects included in this Statement of Work (SOW).  Services will include MHS compatible: comprehensive project management; comprehensive interior design development; planning and purchasing of medical, research, non-medical equipment and furnishings; planning and purchasing information management, physical security, and specialty telecom systems; transition and relocation planning & services; receipt, storage and warehousing of new and existing equipment; installation, technical inspection, maintenance and training for equipment/systems; and final turnover, close-out and post-occupancy evaluations (POE) for identified construction projects.

The camera is stabilized on a swiveling tripod which allows the camera operator to gently rotate the camera vertically and horizontally to continuously track the jumper even when the winds cause extreme drift while the jumper is falling.  This system will also record the compass direction of the plane/jumper in relation to the camera and is used during competition to determine whether the jumper has too much drift to properly judge his/her maneuvers.  Along with compass direction, the video system also records the degrees from the camera to the plane when the jumper exits, at the beginning of his/her maneuver and at the completion of the maneuver.  These controls are in place to properly and fairly judge the freefall discipline of Speed Style.<BR><BR>The recorded video is used to critique each training jump to improve the maneuvers that will be judged at National and International Competitions.<BR><BR>	The Ground to Air Video System shall consist of the following components:<BR>"	CCD CAMERA, COLOR, PANASONIC AW E 300<BR>"	NOVOFELX 600 MM LENS<BR>"	CONVERTER X2 MAGNIFIER<BR>"	C-MOUNT ADAPTER TO MOUNT CAMERA TO TRIPOD<BR>"	TELESCOPE MOUNTED ON CAMERA<BR>"	MONITOR CONTROLS FOR CAMERAMAN, PANASONIC<BR>"	MONITORING SIGHT ATTACHED TO SYSTEM, 15 CM PICTURE FRAME<BR>"	FLUID HYDRAULIC VIDEO HEAD VINTEN WITH MOUNTING FOR THE MONITORING SIGHT<BR>"	ELECTRONIC VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL GRIDMETER TO SHOW AZIMUTH AND DEGREES FROM CAMERA TO OBJECTIVE<BR>"	AUTO FOCUS FOR OBJECTIVE<BR>"	GENERATOR TO PRODUCE SCRIPT ON THE MONITORING SCREEN<BR>"	RECORD ON/OFF SWITCH ON SYSTEM HANDLES<BR>"	TWO HANDLES ON CAMERA WITH RECORD AND MANUAL FOCUS AT HAND HOLDS<BR>"	TRIPOD, TO SUPPORT CAMERA AND MAIN POWER SUPPLY<BR>"	MAIN POWER SUPPLY 220 VOLT/110 VOLT<BR>"	CONDUCTING CABLE<BR>"	2 ALLOY TRANSPORTATION CASES, PELICAN<BR>"	1 POUCH FOR TRIPOD<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>(vii)	This requirement is for delivery FOB (Destination) February 28, 2010 to the US Army Parachute Team, Fort Bragg, NC.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(viii)	The following provisions apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors  Commercial Items, FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (website provided http://farsite.hill.af.mil).  <BR><BR>(ix)	52.212-2, Evaluation  Commercial Items.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
The versions of provisions and clauses incorporated herein are those in effect as of Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-36 dated 8/11/09.

The Virginia Contracting Activity intends a sole source award for subscription services to Bloomberg L.P. for one base year with four 1-year options. The applicable NAICS code is 519130-Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals, with a small business size standard of 500 employees. There are no set-asides identified for this procurement.

The Virginia Contracting Activity is seeking a contract with the Bloomberg L.P. that will allow for  access to real-time and historical pricing, indicative data, reporting, research, estimates, analytics, portfolio management tools , electronic trading & order manage systems, multimedia event and electronic communications in a single integrated  unclassified desktop solution.

The Bloomberg subscription is expected to be a valuable addition to Government analysts. Nearly all topics covered are relevant to the , such as Emerging Markets, Equity, Debt, Currency, and Capital Markets, Economics, World News, Company News, Special Country Reports, and Editorials.

Bloomberg provides a non-Governmental  point of view that is crucial for the Government's understanding of world economies and risks. There are other sources (Reuter’s, Telerate) that provide similar services, but DIA has determined that as a pilot, Bloomberg  provides the best  type of analysis, global coverage, and special reports necessary for comprehensive financial related analysis. 
Market Research (NASA SEWP, GSA-e-BUY) have not been able to identify a third party distribution source for Bloomberg Subscription Services.  Therefore, the Government intends to sole source this requirement to Bloomberg, LP.
This solicitation incorporates the FAR clauses 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jun 2008)); 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Feb 2009)); 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Mar 2009)); 52.212-5 (Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (May 2009)); 52.217-8 (Option to Extend the Services); 52.217-9 (Option to Extend the Term of the Contract); 52.232-18 (Subject to Availability of Funds); 52.232-19 (Subject to Availability of Funds for Next Year); and 52.237-3 (Continuity of Services) for commercial items and services.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this procurement is F2E2M59224A002 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The anticipated award will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-36. The award is set aside 100% for a small business. The associated North American Industry classification system (NAICS) code is 332999, the small business (SB) standard for this code being 500 employees.
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br />1. Safety testing and certification, to include fall prevention, will be accomplished by 49 Fighter Wing Safety Office to standards published by HQ Air Force and HQ Air Combat Command.<br />2. Submissions for consideration must include the following: <br />(a). Drawings or photos of existing stands that demonstrate how the offeror's proposed stand meets the requirements and performance characteristics below.<br />(b). Itemized description as to how each item of the requirements and performance characteristics is met by the design of the offeror's proposed tail maintenance stand.<br />(c). Certification that the required delivery date can be met or statement of proposed delivery date.</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: Contractor shall provide a tail maintenance stand suitable for use on the F-22 Raptor. Minimum performance standards and salient characteristics are as follows:</p>
<p>1. (This requirement is modified to read): Stand must provide simultaneous access to inboard and outboard sides and all of the leading and trailing edges of one of the F-22's vertical tail assemblies at a time. <br />2. Stand must be universal so as to fit either left or right vertical tail assembly.</p>
<p>3. Stand must approach aircraft from rear so as to minimize the possibility of contact with other parts of the tail assemblies, wings, or fuselage.<br />4. Stand must be easily and safely positioned on an aircraft or moved on a hangar floor by four (4) to six (6) people, and have an organic tow bar for use if it needs to be moved to distant location. Tow bar may be fixed or stowable. <br />5. Casters/wheels must have locking swivels and wheel brakes.<br />6. Stand must have at least four (4) levelling/stabilizer jacks to insure the stand will not move while in place around an aircraft, even on uneven flooring.</p>
<p>7. Stand must be modular so it can be disassembled and airloaded in case of deployment. When disassembled, all stand assemblies must fit into C-130 aircraft as a single load. <br />8. Work deck height must be power adjustable from 108" to 140"so work can be conducted at all levels of the vertical tail assembly. A pneumatic height adjustment system incorporating safety pins or locks is preferred, as failure of hydraulic system hoses or tubing could contaminate aircraft surfaces or pose a fire hazard if an electric motor is used to power the hydraulic pump. Lift and pin systems of adjusting height of work decks are not acceptable.<br />9. Lift mechanism must have a manual backup, so if power source is lost or not available the decks can still be raised or lowered as needed.</p>
<p>10. Work decks and stair treads must be made of perforated metal for non -slip footing.<br />11. Painted surfaces must be fluid resistant. If stand is not painted, bare metal must not be susceptible to corrosion or persistent contamination by fluids normally associated with the F-22.<br />12. Work deck(s) must be rated at least 1500 pound capacity to permit multiple workers, tools, and repair parts. <br />13. The work deck(s) must be able to accommodate the outward slant of the F-22 vertical tail assemblies without leaving a gap between either the outboard or inboard vertical tail and work deck(s). Any gap-filler sections of the work deck must have locking mechanisms to insure they will not move when workers are standing on them.<br />14. Any gap-filler sections protruding from the main work deck(s) must be padded at any point they may come in contact with the aircraft.<br />15. Outside perimeter of deck(s) must have guard rails at least 42 inches high.<br />16. The perimeter of the work deck(s) must have a solid metal toe kick with an 18 inch high metal screen attached to it to insure items, tools, parts etc. cannot be kicked overboard.<br />17. Any part of the stand that might come in contact with any part of an aircraft must be padded or protected so it cannot damage the aircraft. <br />18. Stand must be plumbed for air and electrical power to reduce risks from long lengths of dangling hoses or electrical cords.<br />19. Stand must have static and transient electrical grounding capability.</p>
<p>CLIN 0002:<br />Contractor shall provide initial stand assembly and training in stand operation and maintenance at Holloman AFB to five (5) personnel.</p>
<p>Note 1: FAR 52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds (Apr 1984), applies to this acquisition.<br />Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>Note 2: FAR 51.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 - EVALUATION<br />FAR provision 52.212-2 is hereby tailored as follows:<br />Para. (a) - the following is added to this paragraph: The basis for award will be an integrated assessment based on a tradeoff between price and technical acceptability.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this procurement is F2E2M59259A001 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The anticipated award will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-36. The award is set aside 100% for a small business. The associated North American Industry classification system (NAICS) code is 332999, the small business (SB) standard for this code being 500 employees.
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br />1. Safety testing and certification, to include fall prevention, will be accomplished by 49 Fighter Wing Safety Office to standards published by HQ Air Force and HQ Air Combat Command.<br />2. Submissions for consideration must include the following: <br />(a). Drawings or photos of existing stands that demonstrate how the offeror's proposed stand meets the requirements and performance characteristics below.<br />(b). Itemized description as to how each item of the requirements and performance characteristics is met by the design of the offeror's proposed tail maintenance stand.<br />(c). Certification that the required delivery date can be met or statement of proposed delivery date.</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: Contractor shall provide a tail maintenance stand suitable for use on the F-22 Raptor. Minimum performance standards and salient characteristics are as follows:</p>
<p>1. (This requirement is modified to read): Stand must provide simultaneous access to inboard and outboard sides and all of the leading and trailing edges of one of the F-22's vertical tail assemblies at a time. <br />2. Stand must be universal so as to fit either left or right vertical tail assembly.</p>
<p>3. Stand must approach aircraft from rear so as to minimize the possibility of contact with other parts of the tail assemblies, wings, or fuselage.<br />4. Stand must be easily and safely positioned on an aircraft or moved on a hangar floor by four (4) to six (6) people, and have an organic tow bar for use if it needs to be moved to distant location. Tow bar may be fixed or stowable. <br />5. Casters/wheels must have locking swivels and wheel brakes.<br />6. Stand must have at least four (4) levelling/stabilizer jacks to insure the stand will not move while in place around an aircraft, even on uneven flooring.</p>
<p>7. Stand must be modular so it can be disassembled and airloaded in case of deployment. When disassembled, all stand assemblies must fit into C-130 aircraft as a single load. <br />8. Work deck height must be power adjustable from 108" to 140"so work can be conducted at all levels of the vertical tail assembly. A pneumatic height adjustment system incorporating safety pins or locks is preferred, as failure of hydraulic system hoses or tubing could contaminate aircraft surfaces or pose a fire hazard if an electric motor is used to power the hydraulic pump. Lift and pin systems of adjusting height of work decks are not acceptable.<br />9. Lift mechanism must have a manual backup, so if power source is lost or not available the decks can still be raised or lowered as needed.</p>
<p>10. Work decks and stair treads must be made of perforated metal for non -slip footing.<br />11. Painted surfaces must be fluid resistant. If stand is not painted, bare metal must not be susceptible to corrosion or persistent contamination by fluids normally associated with the F-22.<br />12. Work deck(s) must be rated at least 1500 pound capacity to permit multiple workers, tools, and repair parts. <br />13. The work deck(s) must be able to accommodate the outward slant of the F-22 vertical tail assemblies without leaving a gap between either the outboard or inboard vertical tail and work deck(s). Any gap-filler sections of the work deck must have locking mechanisms to insure they will not move when workers are standing on them.<br />14. Any gap-filler sections protruding from the main work deck(s) must be padded at any point they may come in contact with the aircraft.<br />15. Outside perimeter of deck(s) must have guard rails at least 42 inches high.<br />16. The perimeter of the work deck(s) must have a solid metal toe kick with an 18 inch high metal screen attached to it to insure items, tools, parts etc. cannot be kicked overboard.<br />17. Any part of the stand that might come in contact with any part of an aircraft must be padded or protected so it cannot damage the aircraft. <br />18. Stand must be plumbed for air and electrical power to reduce risks from long lengths of dangling hoses or electrical cords.<br />19. Stand must have static and transient electrical grounding capability.</p>
<p>CLIN 0002:<br />Contractor shall provide initial stand assembly and training in stand operation and maintenance at Holloman AFB to five (5) personnel.</p>

Government Answer:  No, we will be both streaming video and utilizing the internet access capability.<BR><BR>The bid was reposted on 09/17/09 due to a change in the Statement of Work (SOW).  Please see the attached SOW for the government's requirements.<BR><BR>Vendor Question:  Do you know how many MB are you planning to use how many minute of streaming?Government Answer:  The megabyte and per minute usage will likely be highly variable (close to zero one month and maybe a gigabyte the next).<BR><BR>Vendor Question 1. The solicitation states 2 bids one for the rate of one aircraft and one for the rate for five. Is it correct to say the rate for five aircraft is intended to be a discounted rate for the cost of  1 megabyte or is it to be the discounted rate for 5 times the price of one megabyte. Government Answer:  The discounted rate would be for five systems.   
Vendor Question 2.Also on the web page the Fedbid service only allows a bid of 1 price per year  that is a monthly price yet the SOW calls out for four prices by the megabyte & minute not month. In addition  it should be 6 prices when low speed voice is included. Government Answer: Please submit the pricing in accordance with the FedBid system and also submit a full quote to Jason Bailey, DHS/CBP Contract SPecialist, via fedbid clientservices@fedbid.com.
Vendor Question 3.The SOW does not currently request pricing for low speed voice per minute but it is included in the scope of work. Government Answer: At this time we have to request more information on the low speed voice per minute question. 
4. The SOW does not include the requirement for a Dashboard which allows the government  customer to  fully provision the SIM cards in the aircraft, to monitor and control traffic usage, see calls currently in progress, set thresholds and receive "low balance" alerts and high usage metering as well as the ability to download invoices online. Government Answer:  We would like the capability to use the Dashboard.<BR><BR>Vendors shall submit a full break down of their bid to clientservices@fedbid.com prior to the bid end date and time.<BR><BR>

<p>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)<br />FOR<br />License Plate Recognition System</p>
<p>1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES - Equipment will be used to monitor vehicles entering Main, Virginia and Pearl Harbor Installation gates. The License Plate recognition System catalogs all vehicles entering or exiting an access point to a site or facility. With data provided from a camera and optical character recognition engine, the program is able to identify vehicles as known or unknown, or classify them into one of many user-identified alert categories for example stolen vehicle, warrant for arrest or special alert. This system provides data in real-time along with a time data stamp, lane number, and images of both the vehicle and license plate to the Security forces Installation Control Center. The system allows the operator to search for a license plate and display all entry and exit information for that vehicle and search by date to show all information on a given day or over a specified time period. Traffic flow can be monitored for peak periods, and repeat visitors may be identified for intelligence purposes. Furthermore, events of 11 Sep 2001 prompted the Air Staff to request unfunded force protection requirements to assist against hostile elements attempting to exploit known command vulnerabilities.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
BRAND NAME

1. The Office of Acquisition Management is conducting this acquisition for:  DOS

2.Nature and/or description of the action being approved:

The GITM and ESOC Programs recommend a brand name procurement of the following: VMware Infrastructure virtualization software (Enterprise Agreement)

3.A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value):

IRM/OPS/ITI/GITM and IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC have identified VMware’s line of virtualization software as meeting the requirements for virtualization on the Department’s classified and sensitive-but-unclassified networks at domestic and overseas locations.   The primary VMware products permit the conversion of what are today separate physical servers to virtual machines, many of which can operate on a small number (two or three) of physical hosts in a clustered environment.  Such an arrangement provides for far more efficient utilization of physical resources, greatly improved redundancy and disaster avoidance/recovery, and significantly enhanced remote monitoring and control.  

The Department wishes to enter into an enterprise license for the use of VMware software Department-wide so as to provide the above benefits in the most cost-effective manner.

GITM anticipates a discount from 25 to 35% on the large quantity to be purchased.

 4.   An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 

As per FAR, 41 USC 253(c)(l), Only one reasonable source and no other suppliers will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(4)(c),Application for brand name descriptions, is cited as the statutory authority.


5.A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  

As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.  This determination was made through analysis based upon a publicly posted RFI conducted in early 2009 that solicited competitive responses based upon the Department of State’s business requirements with regard to security, management, compatibility, and disaster recovery. Based on the responses to the RFI, and GITM and ESOC’s research into the market for server virtualization software, VMware is the only vendor that can meet the following DoS requirements.

-Common Criteria Certification (Evaluation Assurance Level 4):  This is a long-standing, FAM-based requirement from Diplomatic Security that requires an operating system (which virtualization software is considered to be) be Common Criteria Certified.  Initial certification can take a year or more, but upgraded versions can be re-certified in somewhat less time.  Since no other vendor besides VMware has any version of their virtualization software even submitted for initial review, no one is going to have a product that can meet this critical requirement for at least a year or more.
-VM access control through Active Directory and Active Directory integration:  The Department’s networks employ Microsoft’s Active Directory as the mechanism for providing control over access to network objects, such as allowing local administrators at post the ability to view (but not modify) certain aspects of their virtual servers, while allowing DC-based administrators full control for the purpose of maintenance and troubleshooting.  Without such controls, it would be necessary for ESOC administrators to remotely manage separate accounts for both themselves and local administrators at over 450 posts worldwide, and this is not an acceptable option.  VMware has had Active Directory integration for several years, while Citrix’ product still does not have it.
-AppManager integration:  The Department uses NetIQ’s AppManager to monitor the health of servers worldwide.  The Citrix product lacks any means of being monitored by the tool, so monitoring of Citrix-based virtual machines would require the use of some other product, thus splitting the monitoring function into two parts and doubling the effort necessary to accomplish this task.  VMware fully supports monitoring by AppManager.
-Snapshots of virtual machines:  The ability to instantly make a copy of a running virtual machine is essential for backup and disaster recovery purposes, and the Citrix product employs storage-based tools for this purpose.  This ties the feature to a specific vendor’s hardware, and the Department’s requirement is that it be a feature of the product itself so as not to tie backup and recovery features to a specific storage device.  VMware supports snapshots regardless of the hardware platform.
-UPS integration: All of the Department’s servers are capable of monitoring an UPS for a signal to shutdown in the event of a power outage so as to avoid corruption during the power loss when the UPS battery is exhausted.  VMware provides this capability natively, but Citrix only provides a programming interface through which one might be able to build a monitoring tool for this purpose.   Such a home-grown monitoring tool would not be supported by the vendor, and this is unacceptable for use at the Department’s worldwide locations (many of which have extremely poor local power sources).
-Symantec Endpoint Protection 11 support: The Department employs Symantec anti-virus products to protect its systems.  In a virtual environment, both the host operating system (e.g., VMware or Citrix) and the guest/virtual systems (Windows-based servers) must be protected.  VMware supports the use of Symantec anti-virus products, while Citrix does not (they suggest that the Symantec Linux anti-virus product should work on their system, but they do not formally support its use – nor do they identify any alternative product to provide anti-virus protection).  The Department does not wish to have to deploy a different anti-virus product to protect its virtual hosts than it uses for its Windows-based systems, and it will not deploy such systems without anti-virus protection.

6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FedBizOpps synopsis was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 
	
Extensive market research had been done and a RFI was conducted in February 2009.  There were two (2) vendors who showed interest in this type of requirement.  Each of the two vendors was evaluated based on their capabilities to meet the requirements of this type of procurement.  Of the two vendors, only one provided the necessary capabilities to meet the entire criteria for this requirement.  The one vendor is VMware who is the manufacturer for the licenses and has extensive experience with virtualization.  This solicitation will be competed among the current authorized VMware partners.

7.A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
	
			
8.A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 

GITM performed an RFI (SSN_Virtualization_Software, posted January 15th, 2009) to evaluate server virtualization software.  Two vendors (VMware and Citrix) indicated that they believed they were capable of meeting the Department’s requirements, however only VMware was able to demonstrate that they indeed met all requirements.  Citrix acknowledged that they were unable to meet the requirements as described in #5 above:

No other vendors responded to the RFI except those listed above.  GITM’s market research had indicated that Virtual Iron might also have been able to meet many of them, but the company was in the process of being acquired and dissolved at the time of the RFI, and no response was received from them.

As a result of the responses received and the analysis above, it was concluded that VMware was the only vendor capable of meeting the Department’s requirements for virtualization software.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Project Number SI-1710 entitled, Feasibility and Guidelines for the Development of Microgrids in Campus Type Facilities, falls within the topic area of Energy Enterprise Management.<BR><BR>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE: This is a R&D type contract in support of SERDP and was issued against BAA-07-0001. Cost type contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed type contract. The nature of development work often requires a cost or cost-reimbursement arrangement. In addition, the contractor's accounting system has been deemed adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient method and cost controls are used.<BR><BR>This procurement shall explore the feasibility of providing guidelines for the development of microgrids. Microgrids can potentially offer improvements in operating efficiency and increase in reliability of electric power delivery systems, making any mission-critical load more resilient and secure.
