<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Microwave Data to be acquired from numerous satellites over the north pacific from periods when  improve experiment field operations occurred during the winters of 2000-2001 and 2001-2002.  This data wil be aied primarily at monitoring snowfall and light rain.  Data from geostationary satellites will be inserted into that data stream to contribute continuity.  Data will also be processed in conjunction with NOAA Nexrad data from the adjacent US west coast to yield a stream of snowfall and light rainfall data that will be as nearly continuous as the state of the science will permit.  A semi-annual report will be submitted that outlines progress after 6 months with a final report due 6 months later.  The final report will include a CD and/or web page that will display an animation loop of retrieved precipitation during at least one observation period.  Those displays will also include the precipitation derived from the MM5 Mesoscale Model for comparison. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from the University of Washington, Dept. of Atmospheric Science, Seattle, WA.  The expertise and software needed to meaningfully reduce improve data into a form that can be analyzed with remotely sensed data resides in the University of Washington.  Such skills and analysis tools include mesoscale models that focus on north pacific weather and procedures for analyzing the radar and MM wave properties of snowfall.  The University of Washington has demonstrated a work acclaimed performance record in cloud physics and mesoscale modeling.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. Award will be made using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquistion Procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. Award will be made based on responses to this notice. Solicitation number N66001-02-Q-0615 is issued as a Request for Quote. Submit your response via fax to: Melissa Dolan (619) 553-1062, or email: dolanm@spawar.navy.mil. The anticipated award date is 1 AUG 2002. The government is seeking competitive bids for a Novel Unmanned Ground Vehicle Design to permit stepping, straddling, climbing, as well as rapid traversal across planar surfaces of various textures. Introduction: Small unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) of the conventional design suffer from several limitations. Among these are the propensity to high-center on objects such as rails and ridges, and immobility when inverted. In addition, the range of obstacle sizes that a UGV can negotiate is quite limited by the fixed dimensions of the vehicle. The UGV cannot penetrate orifices of dimension less than the breadth of the vehicle, while it cannot overcome obstacles of size greater than half the dimension reached by the center of gravity of the vehicle. Thus any UGV of fixed dimension will always be too large to enter some spaces and too small to climb over other objects or out of other spaces. To extend these ranges, it may be necessary to add degrees of freedom of motion to the vehicle that will, in effect, un-fix the vehicle morphology, altering its dimensions and center of gravity. Physical requirements: The essential idea is a single-person portable and operable, self-contained vehicle that can behaviorally and conformably adapt to most terrain conditions. The UGV must weight less than 14Kg. The UGV must be remotely controllable without a fixed tether, but may have automatic algorithms to facilitate balance and mobility over obstacles. The on-board energy for the UGV must be sufficient for operations in excess of one hour. The UGV must collect environmental information with forward video, physical contact, and stereo audio, and communicate that information back to an operator control unit, along with vehicle energy status, and vehicle motion parameters for all degrees of freedom. The UGV in total must be water proof to a depth of one meter. The UGV must have neither top-bottom, starboard-port, nor bow-stern physical or behavioral asymmetries. Operational requirements: All operations must be independent of other physical assistance, however, a human operator may assist with remote control commands. The UGV must be able to travel on planar surfaces, such as paved roads, at rates in excess of one meter per second. The UGV must be able to climb a flight of 10 steps with a step width of not greater than 100cm, a step rise of not less that 20cm, and a step depth of not greater than 30cm. The UGV must be able to mount, traverse, and dismount from a beam of irregular diameter ranging between 10cm and 20cm and length not less that 3m, suspended between two platforms with elevation variances from 0 to 45 degrees off the horizontal. The UGV must traverse mud, tall grass, underbrush, and rubble of scales comparable to the steps described above. Selection criteria: While price is a significant factor, award will be made based on technically acceptable, responsive small business responses, and may also be subject to the Navy RYG Program. RYG criteria is available upon request. Offerors are invited to submit their quotations for the design and prototype of a UGV that satisfies the above requirements. For a copy of the 'Design Concept', please send your request to dolanm@spawar.navy.mil. You are requested to provide performance history on the product you are proposing (if available). Include model numbers, places of performance, and contact information. All deliveries made under any resulting award will be to: Receiving Officer, SPAWAR SYSTEMSCENTER SAN DIEGO, 53605 Hull Street, San Diego, CA 92152. Technical questions may be addressed to  Dr. Michael R. Blackburn: (619) 553-1904, FAX: (619) 553-6188, email: mike@s pawar.navy.mil. Note 1 applies to this solicitation.

Myriad efforts are being conducted to both develop these labs and the CONOPS that will define their use.  Visualization studies are ongoing in the Department of Defense, in Higher Education, and in Homeland Defense initiatives.  Significant knowledge has been gained in these efforts, and research is needed to identify aspects of the efforts that have Navy application, and definition as to how that application will be applied. Knowledge flow between government and civilian efforts will be invaluable to jumpstarting projects that will allow timely insertion of proven visualization technologies into today's C4ISR environments. 2.0  SCOPE The scope of this effort is to conduct initial research and provide CONOPS definition for Immersive and Related Visualization Techniques in Navy C4ISR.  It is to include examination of capabilities developed by Educational Institutions such as San Diego State University (SDSU) and the University of California San Diego (UCSD), and the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technologies (Cal-(IT)2.  Target military platforms for which this technology is to be researched are Afloat and Ashore Command Centers and labs at SSC SD.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a need to develop a three-day training course on Freeway Management and Operations to provide participants with a general appreciation and understanding of the key policies, institutional issues, challenges and barriers, technical, and other issues to consider in the planning, design, implementation, management, operation, evaluation, and marketing of freeway facilities. This new training course will replace NHI course 137075, Freeway Traffic Operations which is currently being offered as either a three or five day course.  This course was developed prior to the development of the National Highway Institutes' guidelines for adult learning and Instructional System Design (ISD), which focuses on the teaching techniques associated with adult learning.   As a result, this new course must incorporate these ISD principles into the new curriculum. The curriculum material to be developed includes an Instructor's Guide, Participant Workbook, Visual Aids, and Student Exercises and Solutions. Performance must comply with Section 508 of the American With Disabilities Act. 

The Freeway Management and Operations Handbook is the technical reference around which this course will be developed.  This reference, which is currently being revised, is an introductory manual that contains chapters on the key areas associated with managing travel and controlling traffic on freeway facilities. The latest information available regarding the revisions that are being made to the Freeway Management and Operations Handbook can be accessed through the FHWA's Office of Travel Management's website at http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/Travel/traffic/freeway_management.htm. 

This is a full and open solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration.  

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date.

<DESC>Description:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation number is RFQ-R8-02-13.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-17.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 9241   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. E.P.A.) contemplates the purchase of up to sixteen (16) Digital Gamma Spectrometer (DGS) systems for its National Atmospheric Radiation Evaluation Laboratory (NAREL) at Montgomery AL.  However, the Government recognizes that current market prices for such radiation detection equipment may exceed local NAREL funds available for this acquisition.  Therefore, the Government intends to purchase as many DGS systems as local NAREL funds may allow.  Towards this end, the Government will conduct the competition  for this acquisition at "www.FedBid.com".  Interested parties are encouraged to register with FedBid.com. HPGe Detector Electronics System Specifications:  Again, the Government intends to acquire 16 of these systems, subject to available funding.  Systems not procured with this initial funding  will be acquired upon availability of additional funding.  Further, the Government requires that these systems interface properly with the detectors to which NAREL needs to apply them.  NAREL has both P and N type ORTEC and P type PGT detectors.  The Government will list the manufacturers and model  numbers of the dectectors which NAREL requires systems at the time of purchase order contract award: 1. The system shall consist of a state-of-the-art digital gamma spectrometer which performs all the functions of a discrete and conventional analog high voltage power supply, spectroscopy  amplifier, and multi-channel analyzer/buffer. The data acquisition electronics shall include digital filters with adjustable parameters capable of optimizing the performance of all types of germanium detectors. The performance of the digital filters shall exceed the performance of analog systems  using Gaussian or Triangular filter shaping. 2. The successful bidder (hereinafter called the Vendor) shall be the manufacturer of the digital electronics system. Further, the Vendor shall maintain an ISO 9002 certified facility for the manufacture, test, and repair of high-quality DSP spectroscopy  electronics systems. 3. The digital filters shall provide long-term stability of resolution and peak shaping superior to analog systems. The user-selectable, computer-controlled settings for the filter shall include as a minimum: a. Rise time 0.8 to 20.0 mu sec with at least 20 discrete settings  spread reasonably across this range. b. Flat top width 0.5 to 2.0 mu sec with at least 10 discrete settings spread reasonably across this range. 4. The system shall include the preamplifier power supply, High Voltage bias supply, DSP circuitry, and an industry standard (RJ-45 ethernet or USB) PC  (or LAN if appropriate) interface. 5. The Vendor shall supply all necessary interconnecting cables between the data acquisition unit and either a PC or LAN, as appropriate. 6.

The electronics hardware shall provide the necessary functions required to produce a histogrammed spectrum from the preamplifier output for any  HPGe detector. At a minimum, the functions shall include digital filtering, baseline restoration, pile-up rejection, pole-zero cancellation, and digital spectrum stabilization. Resolution at least up to 16384 channels shall be provided. 8. The system shall either: a. be readable/addressable by  NAREL's ORTEC Maestro MCA software, and the spectral files writable in ORTEC ".CHN" or ".SPC" format, so that spectra may be analyzed using NAREL's gamma spectrometry software, Quantum Technology's GDR - or - b. include its own MCA software that writes gamma spectral files that are of a format that  can be analyzed using NAREL's gamma spectrometry software, Quantum Technology's GDR. 9. The electronics shall automatically obtain the optimal match to the system's detector/preamplifier combination including pole-zero cancellation, baseline restorer, rise/fall time, and flat-top adjustments. A  computer-controlled process shall accomplish the automated adjustments. Once optimized, the adjustments of the individual parameters shall still be available without having to re-optimize. A computer-controlled automatic pole-zero cancellation circuit shall be provided. Manual setting of the  pole-zero shall also be provided via the computer interface. A computer-controlled automatic baseline restorer shall be provided. 10. The acquisition system shall have an industry standard extended live time correction method which allows no more than a three percent change, positive or negative  (+/- 3%) in reference peak area over the range of Zero (0) to 50,000 cps. 11. The acquisition system shall store the live and the real time, the acquisition start date and time for each spectral acquisition, along with the spectrum, in non-volatile or battery backed-up memory within the digital  spectrometer itself. 12. The High Voltage bias supply shall be able to provide the appropriate bias voltage, current, and polarity. It shall be possible to enable and monitor the bias from the computer. If an inadvertent detector warm-up occurs, shutdown of the bias voltage shall be controlled by  the digital spectrometer's internal electronics. 13.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA,  is acquiring services to perform aerial surveys for the right whale early warning system for the National Ocean Service (NOS), Center for Coastal Environmental Health & Biomolecular Research at Charleston, South Carolina.  The period of performance is a base period of twelve (12) months and two (2) twelve month option periods.  The primary objective of the project is to locate right whales in their winter calving grounds and report the locations in near-real time to mariners operating commercial, military, and other vessels in these areas so they may elect to take action to reduce the likelihood of collisions with right whales.  A secondary objective is to recommend to NOAA Fisheries additional measures which, based on experience with this program, may improve the effectiveness and efficiency of right whale detection and mitigation of possible vessel collisions.  This project may also serve as a source information on the distribution of marine mammals and sea turtles in the study area.  This project shall consist of a survey year in Georgia and northern Florida to be conducted during December 1, 2002 through March 31, 2003. The daily surveys will extend from the southern end of Cumberland Island, GA, approximately 12 km north of the St. Mary's River entrance out to 30.825N and -80.785W, to approximately 12 km south of the St. John's River entrance out to 30.275N and -80.785W under VFR flight conditions.  This area shall be surveyed from 0.9 km (0.5 nmi) of the shoreline out to approximately 60 km from shore.  Survey track lines shall be separated by 5.5 km (3.0 nmi) and flown perpendicular to the coast.  Track lines shall be flown at an altitude of 1000 feet above sea level to maximize the sightability of right whales and at an airspeed of approximately 160 km/hr.  The Northern American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) is 541370.  This acquisition is not set aside for small business. All interested parties may request a copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP)within fifteen (15) days of its publication.  Requests must be in writing to the address stated herein.  Facsimile requests will be accepted to the attention of Jackie Shewmaker at (816) 426-7530.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Jackson, Mississippi, New Construction, Design Phase, United States District Courthouse, Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session.

On Wednesday, August 7, 2002, the United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct a Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session for prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants for the design phase of a new United States District Courthouse.  The Networking Session will be conducted from 6 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. in Room 501B of The McCoy Federal Building, 100 West Capitol Street, Jackson, Mississippi.

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by the U.S. District Court, U. S. Court of Appeals, U.S. Magistrate Court, U.S.Bankruptcy Court, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal Service, Circuit Library, U.S. Probation Service, U.S. Trustee, Congressional Offices, and GSA.  The Estimated Total Project Cost (ETPC) is between $68,000,000 and $78,000,000 and most design disciplines are expected to be represented.

The Subcontracting Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA?s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the firms that have been Short-Listed as the prospective Architect/Engineer for this project.

Prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants will be given an opportunity to network with the Short-Listed Architect/Engineer firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors/consultants.  Because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between Primes and Subcontractor/Consultants, any contracts that may develop between potential Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants as a result of the Networking Session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Networking Session may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA?s Small Business Outreach Specialist, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV; or Pat Geisinger, GSA?s Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail Pat.Geisinger@GSA.GOV.

On Monday, July 22, 2002, the United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct a SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING NETWORKING SESSION for prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants for the design phase of the new United States District Courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee.  The Networking Session will be from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. at the Marriott Renaissance Hotel, 611 Commerce Street, Nashville, Tennessee. 

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by The U.S. District Court, The U.S. Magistrate?s Court, The U. S. Attorney, The U.S. Marshal Service, the Circuit Satellite Library, The U.S. Probation and Pretrial Service, and GSA.  The Estimated Total Project Cost is between $100,000,000 and $110,000,000 and most design and construction disciplines are expected to be represented.

The Subcontracting Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA?s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the firms that have been Short-Listed as the prospective Architect/Engineer on this project.

Prospective Small Business Subcontractor/Consultants will be given an opportunity to network with the Short-Listed Architect/Engineer firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors/consultants.  Because GSA is not permitted to be a party to contractual relationships between Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants, any contracts that may develop between potential Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants as a result of this Networking Session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Networking Session may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA?s Small Business Outreach Specialist, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail davida.gibson@gsa.gov; or Pat Geisinger, GSA?s Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail pat.geisinger@gsa.gov.

<DESC>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has a requirement to conduct a Records Management Program in accordance with the requirements set forth in the following documents:  44 United States Code 21, 29, 21 and 33; Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter XII, Subchapter B, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Publications. The Federal Election Commission is seeking sources that are capable of performing the tasks and duties that will ensure that the FEC satisfies these requirements to the fullest extent possible.  The Federal Election Commission is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to industry to obtain market research in order to assist in the development of a preliminary acquisition planning.  All interested parties must respond via e-mail with information on their services with sufficient technical and price detail to allow for a detailed evaluation to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Aaron H. Ford at aford@fec.gov or via telephone (202) 694-1328. no later than 12 July 2002.  The subject line of the e-mail message should be "Records Management Program".  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System code is 541611.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.  Firms that wish to respond to this RFI should provide the following information:  (1) a brief summary of the services offered in response to this RFI, a statement indicating an interest and capability to provide the services as described, a technical approach to the Statement of Work provided herein, and a cost estimate.  The cost estimate will be used for budgetary planning purposes.  The Federal Election Commission is issuing this Request for Information to industry.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY!!!  It is neither a Request for Proposals (RFP)/Solicitation, nor an indication that FEC will contract for the services described in this RFI.  There is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services .  The Government does not intend to award a contract solely on the basis of the RFI.  The Government will NOT pay for information received in response to this RFI.  Submitted documents will NOT be returned to those firms who provide responses to this RFI.  Statement of Work--(A) Introduction: The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has a requirement to conduct a Records Management Program in accordance with the requirements set forth in the following documents:  44 United States Code 21, 29, 21 and 33; Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter XII, Subchapter B, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Publications.  The purpose of this Statement of Work is to solicit contractor support to perform specific tasks and duties that will ensure that the FEC satisfies these requirements to the fullest extent possible.  (B) Background--FEC Headquarters is located at 999 E Street NW, Washington DC 20463.  The Federal Election Commission consists of approximately 350 employees.  The FEC generates both hardcopy and electronic records but the hardcopy records constitute the official recordkeeping copy.  Most records are filed either at or near the employee's office/workstation in individual file cabinets or, when necessary, sent to the Washington Records Center for immediate storage.  (C) Definitions--(1) Disposition:  An action that removes a record from retention by the FEC because it is no longer needed for current agency operations/business.  Disposition of all records must be approved by NARA and may consist of actions such as the destruction, the deletion, and the shipment of records to a records center or directly to NARA for permanent retention.  (2) General Records Schedule:  A document that lists all FEC records not listed in the NARA's General Records Schedule.  This document consists of NARA approved records schedules and provides instructions for what to do with records that are no longer needed for current agency operations/business.  It is also called records disposition schedule, record control schedule, records retention schedule, or schedule.  (3) Record:  All books, papers, maps, photographs, machine-readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government because of the informational value of data in them. (4) 
Unscheduled Record:  A record whose final disposition has not been approved by NARA.  (D) Scope of Work--Work will be performed within the main office of the FEC at 999 E Street NW, Washington DC 20463.  The Contractor will provide all the personnel, expertise, materials, and services necessary to successfully perform the contract.  The approach/methodology to be used to accomplish this Statement of Work is to be the methodology that will be the most effective and economically feasible for the FEC.  Proposals for this effort should clearly show the methodology and the proposed cost structure and the Contractor's plans for accomplishing this effort.  E. Work to Be Performed--(1) Review and inventory all FEC paper records down to the custodian level.  The inventory shall include a descriptive listing of each record series, including but not limited to, function, purpose, content, location, arrangement, reference activity, annual accumulation and retention period for each record.  (2) Assist the FEC's Office of Deputy Staff Director for Management and associated offices (i.e., Administrative Office, Data Systems Development Division, and Finance Office) in setting up their paper files to conform to file plans and record-schedules.

If held, FISC Norfolk will conduct price negotiations with qualifying vendors via competitive, anonymous, on-line reverse auction. The submission of a quote in response to this solicitation will be considered irrevocable consent by the vendor to participate in the "reverse auction". In the event FISC Norfolk conducts price negotiations via reverse auction, all vendors who submitted a timely and technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to become a qualifying vendor. Only those vendors who submit a timely and technically acceptable quote and who timely and successfully complete all registration and all training requirements will be considered a qualifying vendor. The registration process includes the completion and execution of forms and agreements required for the reverse auction process. Warning: Vendors who fail to become a qualifying vendor for purposes of reverse auction price negotiations, if held, will be ineligible for contract award and eliminated from further considerations. The reverse auction, if held, will commence within 10 calendar days of the closing date of this solicitation. Qualifying vendors will be notified of the specific starting time at least 2 working days prior to the commencement of the event. Notification will be by electronic mail, return receipt requested. Vendors shall timely complete the registration and training process through https://gov1.procuri.com in accordance with the established procedures and guidelines. All registration and training must be completed to participate in the reverse auction price negotiations.

By completing the registration and training process, the vendor acknowledges its understanding of the rules, terms, conditions and agreements governing the reverse auction and consents unconditionally to be bound by the rules, terms, conditions and agreements governing the reverse auction. The reverse auction price negotiations will be conducted for a period of 20 minutes and, unless automatically extended as provided below, automatically close when 20 minutes have elapsed. The reverse auction period will be automatically extended only if a qualifying vendor submits a lowest price offer within last 2 minutes of the reverse auction period. In such case, the reverse auction period will be extended for a period of 2 minutes from the post time of the lowest price offer. Example: if a vendor submits a lowest price offer that posts after 19 minutes and 15 seconds have elapsed (within the last 2 minutes of the period), the reverse auction period will be automatically extended for a total time period of 21 minutes and 15 seconds (an extension of 2 minutes from the post time of the last lowest offer). If extended, the reverse auction period will automatically close when 2 minutes have elapsed without a vendor posting another lowest price offer. The timeliness of a price offer will be based upon when the government receives it. Vendors shall not revise their price offers upwards. The vendor's initial quote shall be their starting price offer during the reverse auction price negotiations. The minimum decrement for revised price offers shall be $50.00 from the last posted lowest price offer. Vendors shall submit all revised price offers only through the online mechanism supplied by Procuri.com. Vendors shall not submit revised price offers via any other means including, but not limited to, post, courier, fax, email, or orally, unless specifically requested by the contracting officer. Each qualifying vendor expressly and irrevocably consents to reveal their prices (in anonymity) during the reverse auction price negotiations. All qualifying vendor's initial quotes and subsequent price revisions, if any, will be anonymously revealed to all qualifying vendors during the reverse auction. By submitting a revised price offer, the vender unconditionally revokes all its prior posted price offers. By submitting a revised price offer, the vendor confirms that its revised price offer is not the result of a mistake of any kind and agrees to be bound by the revised price offer. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless discussions are held and final quotes are requested. The contracting officer reserves the right to suspend or cancel the reverse auction at any time. If the contracting officer suspends or cancels the reverse auctions, final quotes will be requested from only the qualifying vendors by an amendment to the solicitation.

<DESC>Due to a POST operation failure, the following is resubmitted:
The Marine Corps Systems Command has a requirement to leverage off commercial industry for a Load Moment Indicator (LMI) for its fleet of 25 Ton High Speed High Mobility Cranes, TAMCN B0443. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the LMI in accordance with FAR 12.6 for commercial items as defined in FAR Part 2.1, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The subject Request for Proposals (RFPs) incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-01 and Defense Acquisition Circular 91-13. 
Scope: This purchase description establishes the required design and performance requirements for the LMI. 
Intended Use of LMI: LMI will be installed on the 25 Ton Crane to provide monitoring and real time information of the crane and load to the crane operator.  The LMI will provide current operating conditions by graphic LCD with standard or customized readouts.  Accurate, real time information will be provided in a comprehensive format on a back-lighted digital display.  Display information will include rated load, actual load, operating radius, boom length, boom angle, tip height, and parts-of-line for up to five (5) parts-of-line.  LMI will provide a self-testing/calibration capability, an anti-two block warning, and the capability to automatically shut down the crane operations if safe ratings limits are exceeded.  LMI will be protected against water/corrosion.  The LMI should be capable of operating using the crane?s 24-volt electrical system.  
Operational Effectiveness: Unless otherwise specified, the design, material composition, and manufacturing processes associated with the LMI are the prerogative of the offeror. Any resulting product submitted to the Government shall fully comply with performance parameters, functional interface requirements, and design characteristics specified herein. All parameters specified as objectives are subject to the offeror's discretion for design/performance consideration, or tradeoff. Design shall facilitate intended employment of the LMI primarily on the 25 ton Cranes.  
Characteristics: All physical characteristics of the LMI, inclusive of design and test methods, shall be compliant with best commercial practices. The LMI must function without breakage in operating temperatures - 25 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Verification: Unless otherwise specified, the offeror is responsible for the execution of all inspections and certifications related to conformance and performance of the LMI and its components. The Government intends to accomplish limited testing, relying instead upon offeror data to substantiate design quality, manufacturing processes, and performance of the LMI. The offeror shall provide evidence of, and warrant conformance and compliance with, applicable standards and practices. The Government reserves the right to validate conformance through independent analyses, inspections and/or testing should such action be deemed necessary. 
Packaging: Best commercial practices.  
Training: The Government would like training proposed by geographic regions: CONUS, OCONUS and Hawaii. 
Commercial Warranty: The LMI shall be warranted to comply with all design and performance criteria established as a result of this specification as incorporated into the offeror's conforming product. Any additional warranty provisions or exclusions shall be clearly stated in the offeror?s proposal submission. The Government seeks a standard commercial warranty with options to extend the warranty to 36 months.  
The Government anticipates issuing an ID/IQ Firm Fixed Price (FFP) commercial contract to the successful offeror. Orders will be issued in accordance with the selected offeror?s ability to produce and deliver the quantities specified herein. Quantities and period of performance are as follows: Maximum Quantity is 210 units. Contract Minimum is 1 unit. An estimated quantity of 16 LMIs will be shipped to Okinawa, Japan.

Offerors may delineate their pricing based upon their own determination of economic production lots (e.g., 1 - 35, $xx; 36 - 70, $xx). The Government will use an average unit production price associated with the offeror's price delineation to establish an overall evaluated price. 
Federal Acquisition Regulation-52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -Commercial Items: Offerors shall submit a combined technical/business proposal as elements of their offer. Offerors shall not submit more than one (1) offer in response to this solicitation.  An original and three (3) copies of the offer are required.

To support their business offer, offerors are requested to submit electronic pricing workups (e.g., Schedule of Supplies) (e.g., MS Excel) also on the CD-ROM. If conflicts arise between the material presented in the proposal and the CD-ROM, the precedence for consideration shall be with the written material. Sealed offers for the items to be provided shall be hand-carried or express mailed via UPS or Federal Express to the following location by 2:00PM (EST) July 26, 2002: COMMANDER, Attn: Ms. Peggy L. Smith, CTQPLS, MARCORSYSCOM, 2032 Barnett Ave., Quantico, VA 22134-5010. NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.

Award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the Government. In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall technical and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price. However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior has been tasked with the management of an intergovernmental effort entitled "GeoSpatial One Stop".  The focus of the GeoSpatial One Stop initiative is to accelerate the development and implementation of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure technology, policies and standards that support "one-stop" access.  The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) is tasked with coordinating the Federal Government's development of the NSDI and will the lead GeoSpatial One-Stop project to define and build national consensus on content of a geographic data framework.  One of many areas of concern in the development of the NSDI and its initiatives is the establishment of a Financing Solutions Team to look at opportunities for new approaches that will aid in its implementation.  In order to accomplish this, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) anticipates entering into non-competitive negotiations with Urban Logics, Inc. of New York City, New York to continue to research and implement understanding the economics of and financial solution for the NSDI.  It is anticipated that Urban Logic, Inc. with collaborate with OMB, the USGS, and other economists to prepare an analysis of the value proposition for Geospatial One-Stop; assist the FGDC and OMB on OMB's proposed data call to survey meaningful agency framework and other spatial investment activity; organize financing solutions procedures; support in the development and implementation of Geospatial One-Stop strategies that serve to build and use the NSDI; website review and development; and participation in presentations and briefings.  Urban Logic, Inc. provides a unique mix of skills and capabilities in technology and information initiatives that seek to improve information management and infrastructure development.  Urban Logic, Inc. has expertise in investment banking, finance and legal matters.   It has a strong project finance and transactional based experience in aiding government programs in addressing relationships to private sector financing capabilities.  The USGS is not aware of any other organization that has the understanding of spatial data, technology, financing, banking, and legal topics and the skill in relating these to Government programs at all levels of Government. Firms who believe they can provide the required support are invited to submit an affirmative response within 45 days of the publication of this announcement in accordance with note 22.  All such responses will be evaluated in order to determine whether that firm has full knowledge and capabilities to meet the USGS's requirement. An affirmative response shall include literature, brochures, and other such information corresponding to the required items which demonstrates the capabilities of the offeror.  This notice is for information purposes only.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) is not available.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

The Government will NOT pay for information received in response to this RFI.  Submitted documents will NOT be returned to those firms who provide responses to this RFI.  Statement of Work--(A) Introduction: The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has a requirement to conduct a Records Management Program in accordance with the requirements set forth in the following documents:  44 United States Code 21, 29, 21 and 33; Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter XII, Subchapter B, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Publications.  The purpose of this Statement of Work is to solicit contractor support to perform specific tasks and duties that will ensure that the FEC satisfies these requirements to the fullest extent possible.  (B) Background--FEC Headquarters is located at 999 E Street NW, Washington DC 20463.  The Federal Election Commission consists of approximately 350 employees.  The FEC generates both hardcopy and electronic records but the hardcopy records constitute the official recordkeeping copy.  Most records are filed either at or near the employee's office/workstation in individual file cabinets or, when necessary, sent to the Washington Records Center for immediate storage.  (C) Definitions--(1) Disposition:  An action that removes a record from retention by the FEC because it is no longer needed for current agency operations/business.  Disposition of all records must be approved by NARA and may consist of actions such as the destruction, the deletion, and the shipment of records to a records center or directly to NARA for permanent retention.  (2) General Records Schedule:  A document that lists all FEC records not listed in the NARA's General Records Schedule.  This document consists of NARA approved records schedules and provides instructions for what to do with records that are no longer needed for current agency operations/business.  It is also called records disposition schedule, record control schedule, records retention schedule, or schedule.  (3) Record:  All books, papers, maps, photographs, machine-readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government because of the informational value of data in them. (4) 
Unscheduled Record:  A record whose final disposition has not been approved by NARA.  (D) Scope of Work--Work will be performed within the main office of the FEC at 999 E Street NW, Washington DC 20463.  The Contractor will provide all the personnel, expertise, materials, and services necessary to successfully perform the contract.  The approach/methodology to be used to accomplish this Statement of Work is to be the methodology that will be the most effective and economically feasible for the FEC.  Proposals for this effort should clearly show the methodology and the proposed cost structure and the Contractor's plans for accomplishing this effort.  E. Work to Be Performed--(1) Review and inventory all FEC paper records down to the custodian level.  The inventory shall include a descriptive listing of each record series, including but not limited to, function, purpose, content, location, arrangement, reference activity, annual accumulation and retention period for each record.  (2) Assist the FEC's Office of Deputy Staff Director for Management and associated offices (i.e., Administrative Office, Data Systems Development Division, and Finance Office) in setting up their paper files to conform to file plans and record-schedules.  Assistance includes the following--(a) Preparing/assisting in labeling file folders;
(b) Preparing disposition guides; (c) Reviewing nonrecords and preparing them for removal from the applicable offices.  (3) Prepare file plans for each office within the Office of the Deputy Staff Director for Management in accordance with NARA direction and guidance.  (4) Prepare drafts and finalize requests for record disposition authority for any unscheduled FEC records and to review all existing records to be updated.  (5) Review and update the FEC Records and Disposition Schedule.  (6) Prepare record schedules for any unscheduled records identified during the inventory and draft revisions for existing records schedule items as necessary.  F.

<DESC>This is a revision to original Fed Biz Ops posting on 17 June 2002.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is seeking potential sources for a possible multiple year lease of 737-700 aircraft (700C preferred) to serve as E-6B In-Flight Trainers. The U. S. Navy has a requirement to provide annual training to 28 Category I (Initial E-6 qualification) aviators and eight Category III (E-6 re-qualification) aviators and to augment fleet operating squadrons by providing proficiency training for E-6 qualified pilots.  The annual flight requirement for this training syllabus is 2,000 flight hours and 6,000 cycles. The training program support to be provided is for two, five-hour sorties per day, five days per week, plus six weekend cross country flights (each with three Remain Over Nights; qualified Airframe and Powerplant mechanic must accompany), per year. Aircraft availability is required in the first quarter of FY-04. The aircraft will be based and operated from Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Ramp space and maintenance facilities will be provided at Tinker for the contractor?s use.  Naval Pilots will operate the aircraft throughout the continental United States.  Each 737-700 airframe proposed for this effort must show compliance with the following: a current Federal Aviation Administration Airworthiness Certificate and be able to operate in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation Part 91; all Airworthiness Directives; and the ability to obtain a NAVAIR 4.0 airworthiness flight clearance per NAVAIR Instructions 13030.1A and 13034.1B (the NAVAIR instructions are available from the following web site http://www.navair.navy.mil. All organizational and depot maintenance will be the responsibility of the contractor and will be performed in accordance with the Boeing Maintenance Planning Document for the aircraft offered, tailored to fit the operating environment, approved by the E-6B Program Manager and Assistant Program Manager, Engineering. The Navy is exploring the establishment of a lease contract for a base period of one year plus four one-year options for a total of less than five years. The Navy requires the option to purchase the aircraft outright at any time prior to, during or at the end of the lease agreement. Responses to this sources sought are requested to provide a cost rough order of magnitude (ROM) to execute this contractual arrangement. Responses should provide ROM data to include: outright purchase of the aircraft prior to, during (at the end of each option) and up to 60 days after the end of the lease period; annual maintenance cost to maintain the aircraft in the event the Government purchases the aircraft; dry lease (no maintenance/no fuel) of the aircraft for the base year and each option year; wet lease (all maintenance/no fuel) of the aircraft for the base year and each option year; and, if required, preparation of the aircraft to qualify the aircraft for the NAVAIR 4.0 airworthiness flight clearance. Lease payments shall not contain equity interest. This request for information is NOT a contract; or a request for proposal; or a promise to contract; or a commitment of any kind. The Navy will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for any data offered for examination; therefore, the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to review and use data at its own discretion. Upon request, NAVAIR will protect proprietary information from unwanted disclosure.

To more efficiently deliver logistics for its construction force deployed worldwide, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) seeks to partner with industry.  TYPE OF OPPORTUNITY:  In the past, the NCF has purchased TOA items for use in future contingencies.  The NCF is interested in a departure from this approach to avoid the costs and inefficiencies associated with the purchase and long-term storage of TOA equipment and material.  NAVFAC seeks to reduce costs by providing equipment and material assets in a just-in-time, on-demand manner.  To accomplish this savings, NAVFAC invites industry to provide comments, suggestions and/or concepts for a contractual relationship to supply on-demand construction equipment for the Naval Construction Force during a contingency operation.  SIZE OF OPPORTUNITY:  The Naval Construction Force (NCF) outfits its construction units with a variety of equipment for use in military and disaster contingency environments.  This equipment inventory is identified in each units Table of Allowance (TOA), which is a listing of each item of material or equipment that the unit needs to sustain itself for an established period of time.  The TOA is comprised of approximately 600 pieces of construction equipment and 3323 support items.  The TOA has a purchase value of approximately $81M.  NAVFAC is interested in business concepts that explore the potential to creatively lease the total or part of the NCF inventory.  TOA Definitions:  Civil Engineer Support Equipment (CESE):  Non-tactical type equipment including construction and weight handling.  Requirement includes a 90-day supply of associated maintenance items, repair parts and repair manuals.  Field Facilities:  The shelter-envelope, foundation, partitions, ceiling, floor, windows, doors, electrical and mechanical systems to the five-foot line.  Types of facilities include troop housing, showers, latrines, galley, repair shops, and command & control shelters.  Central Tool Room Kits:  All central tool room tool kits including company level, hand and power tools, tool support (other than kits), fire, safety, hearing protection & shop equipment tools.  Types of tool kits include builder, carpenter, utilitiesman, plumber, electrician, steelworker, mechanic, and engineering aide, draftsman and surveyor.  CORE REQUIREMENTS:  At a minimum the concept must provide for the following core NCF needs;  (1) provide the requested non-tactical CESE (including a 90 day supply of associated maintenance items, repair parts and repair manuals) and other TOA material within 65 days of notification;  (2) ship the requested CESE, maintenance items and material as directed to CBC Port Hueneme, CA or CBC Gulfport, MS prepared for transport and packing in accordance with published government instructions;  (3) replace any defective CESE or material within seven (7) days to the point of debarkation;  (4) provide Program Manager to be contacted on a 24 hour/7 days per week basis until the CESE or material is returned;  (5) provide the government, on a semi-annual basis, process review documentation that assesses contract performance, evaluates readiness, provides guidance or offers corrective action for shortfalls;  (6) some, all, or none of the equipment may be ordered during the life of the contract.  ACTION REQUIRED BY INDUSTRY:  Industry is urged to explore all types of contractual arrangements that will provide the above core requirements of on-demand CESE and other TOA items.  If suggesting a lease type contract arrangement please consider the option to purchase.  NAVFAC looks for a single point of coordination from a team of commercial and Navy Logistics specialists.  Industry is asked to also comment on the commerciality of the list and to make suggestions to convert the list to commercially available alternatives.  A sample list of CESE equipment is available by written request to the e-mail site listed below.  Lists for the Central Tool Rooms and Field Facilities are not available at this time.  Interested parties should provide, in writing, any comments, questions, suggestions or a workable contractual concept to NAVFACCO, NFI, NF20, Bldg. 41, Attn:  Kris Slaton, 3502 Goodspeed Street Ste. 2, Port Hueneme, CA 93043-4337 or e-mail to SlatonKE@cbchue.navfac.navy.mil no later than 23 August 2002.   This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  An award will not be made on offers received in response to this notice.  This synopsis is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and no solicitation is available at this time.

<SUBJECT>A -- Targets and Countermeasures Acquisition Strategy - Industry Day
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency, Targets and Countermeasures (MDA TC) Program Office intends to select a prime contractor responsible to the Government for providing target systems for testing the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) and its  elements.  "Target systems" refers to all necessary components of a target such as boosters, reentry vehicles and payloads such as countermeasures, instrumentation and sensor packages.  The prime contractor will be responsible for planning and executing all aspects of the BMDS targets program to include, but not limited to, systems engineering and integration, advanced concepts and new development, product acquisition, range integration and launch services, logistics support, and system-wide business operations and program management.

To move towards that selection TC will conduct an Industry Day on Wednesday July 24, 2002 at the Holiday Inn located at 1900 North Fort Myer Drive, Arlington, VA 22209.  The Industry Day briefings will be conducted at the unclassified level.

The purposes of this Industry Day are to provide an overview of MDA TC requirements, to discuss its milestone schedule for contract award and to provide a detailed discussion of its major acquisition strategy objectives.  Those objectives are 1) To provide system level management of target systems through an integrating prime contractor, 2) To understand and manage target acquisition cycle time drivers and constraints - further to set cycle time goals according to need/demand and to balance corresponding investment initiatives by affordable business case analysis.  Accordingly, cycle time goals may vary uniquely by targets system, major components and subsystems and 3) To emphasize and contain program costs, set portfolio wide investment priorities and time phased investment strategies in order to manage total acquisition costs and to stimulate creative cost reducing initiatives.

To clarify the desired point of departure for prime management of the targets system, the following additional objectives are set: 1) Implement a single organization and management structure (to include involvement of Government and National Labs) for executing all aspects of the BMDS Targets and Countermeasures Program, 2) Create a comprehensive systems engineering activity to span all technical needs of the BMDS target system.  Organize to perform analyses and assess trade-space alternatives for areas to include: enhanced target systems capability, increased asset flexibility/adaptability, improved availability cycle time, and balanced affordability, 3) Develop transition plans that describe the actions required to assume management and execution responsibility of ongoing and future target systems activity to include full development of associated technical, cost, risk and schedule implications, and 4) Define and establish the necessary business/contract structure and product execution work flow that best assures workforce and critical skill-mix retention throughout the period of performance to include necessary/special incentive arrangements for success.

All companies with a capability and interest in meeting all or part of MDA TC requirements are invited to participate.  Foreign firms may attend the Industry Day, but are advised they may be precluded from proposing.

Companies must register to attend this Industry day and may be represented by up to four people.  To provide an opportunity for companies to more fully communicate about issues thy feel may be unique to them, one-on-one meetings will be scheduled to follow the general meeting.

To register and, if interested, to schedule a one-on-one meeting, please e-mail Mr. Patrick Linehan at Patrick.Linehan-contractor@mda.osd.mil and provide your company name, the names of planned attendees (up to four), and the name, e-mail address and phone number of your company point of contact for this event.

<SUBJECT>A -- Fixture for Assisting in the Removal and Emplacement of Pipe Strings in Boreholes
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE FIXTURE FOR ASSISTING IN THE REMOVAL AND EMPLACEMENT OF PIPE STRINGS IN BOREHOLES


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's fixture for assisting in the removal and emplacement of pipe strings in boreholes.

LLNL has invented a safety apparatus that aids in the use of installing and pulling submersable groundwater pumps from deep wells.

The LLNL apparatus not only saves time but more importantly prevents on-the-job back injuries caused by the typical method of repetitive motion of bending, stooping, pulling, and twisting.

The apparatus has saved approximately 200 to 250 man hours per year for the Department of Energy. The safety factor can represent savings in back injury compensation costs as well.

Government and commercial uses for this technology include well maintenance service and pump removal and installations for groundwater such as drinking water, monitoring wells and extraction.

LLNL is in the process of patenting this invention.  In the meantime, LLNL is seeking industrial partners to commercialize the invention. LLNL is also looking for collaborative research and development to improve the invention and to explore other usages of the invention. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's fixture for assisting in the removal and emplacement of pipe strings in boreholes should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO02-017-304.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's subject title.
