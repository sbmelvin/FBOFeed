5.6	Before starting work, all equipments shall be locked out and tagged out using the ship’s HV lock out procedures
5.7	Dry insulation with high insulation resistance is capable of holding electrical charge for several hours.  For reasons of Safety, it is essential that the winding to be worked on be adequately earthed prior to any such work being carried out.  For a stator winding of this size we would recommend an earthing period of approximately one hour.
6.0	QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS: None additional
7.0	STATEMENT OF WORK
7.1	Provide the services of OEM Tech rep (Converteam) to assist Ship’s Force in performing the following maintenance items per Reference 2.1.
7.2	The below shall be performed on all 4 generators.
7.3	CLEAN AND SERVICE GENERATOR 
7.3.1  Remove and clean CAW cooler.  Refer to reference 2.1 section 6.4
7.3.2  Precautions shall be taken to not spill coolant on the machine windings.
7.3.3  The coolers are five section coolers and have been designed for vertical withdrawal of the stacks without removing the complete cooler from the top of the generator.
7.3.4  Turn water supply off, drain cooler and disconnect.
7.3.5   Undo the outer set of fixings around the stack endplate at the water connection end.
7.3.6	Undo the cover box at the return end.
7.3.7	Remove the bolts, nuts and washers from the bottom flange and the top angle flange of the end duct.
7.3.8	Lift the end duct away.  The frame of the cooling stack has holes for lifting shackles.  The stack should be lifted away from the generator using these holes.
7.3.9	Set the stack up on blocks under the frame, not the dins, so that there is space all around it, and blow the fins out with clean dry compressed air at no more than 21 psi.  If the dirt is oily, the fins may be sprayed with a warm detergent solution bit if this is done; dry the stack afterwards with air before it is replaced in the housing.
7.3.10	On the water side, remove both water box covers and rod the tubes through.  Soft deposits can be removed with a brass brush but hard scale may need special treatment, See reference 2.1.
7.3.11	Waterbox gaskets should be examined for leaks.  If a leak is found, remove the header box and fit with gasket as specified in Reference 2.1.
7.3.12	Check for leaks in length of tubes between end 
7.3.13	Remove overall cover.  Refer to reference 2.1 section 6.4
7.3.14	Clean all air ducts in the stator.
7.3.15	Clean the windings.
7.3.16	Do not allow solvents to soak into the windings as this causes porosity of the insulation and allows the penetration of semi conducting dirt detrimental to ir.
7.3.17	Check the end windings and ensure that all supports and bindings are tight.
7.3.18	Check all connections for cleanliness and tightness.
7.3.19	Look for signs of overheating.
7.3.20	Clean around the bearing pedestal, especially around the insulation between the pedestal and the stool.
7.3.21	Check air gaps, air seals and oil seals.  Faulty seals should be replaced as these will reduce the efficiency of the cooling and the machine may run hot.
7.3.22	Inspect the exciter and PMG windings and the rectifier assembly. Clean as required.
7.3.23	Clean the cooler.
7.3.24	Replace overall cover and CACW cooler.
7.3.25	Vent cooler when refilling.
7.4	GENERATOR WINDIGS POLARIZATION INDEX TEST
7.4.1	The Polarization Index (PI) of a generator’s windings is use full for assessing the fitness of the machine for service.  The PI is calculated form the measurements of the windings insulation resistance.
7.4.2	Before measuring the insulation resistance, remove all external connections to the machine and completely discharge the windings to the grounded machine frame.
7.4.3	Apply a constant 500 VDC between the windings and the ground using a direct indicating megohmeter for 10 minutes. 
7.4.4	The PI is a calculated ratio of the 10 minute to the 1 minute value of the insulation resistance, measured consecutively.  Record resistance values after 1 minute and after 10 minutes.  The calculation is as follows:
7.4.4.1	Tested values should be compared against previous readings to track changes.  If history is not available the recommended minimum values of PI for all machine components insulation classes per IEC 60085-01:1984 are:
Thermal Class Rating	Minimum PI
Class A	1.5
Class B	2.0
Class F	2.0
Class H	2.0
7.4.5	These are the lowest values at which a winding is recommended for an over voltage test or for operation.
7.4.6	The PI test is not applicable to non insulated field windings.
7.4.7	Very high PI greater than 8 for varnished cambric, shellac mica-folium, or asphaltic stator windings may indicate that the insulation has been thermally aged and may be at risk of failure.  Physical inspection can be used to confirm if the insulation is dry and brittle.
7.5	Testing/Inspection: Per OEM instructions
7.6	Service Report: OEM Tech Rep to provide the Chief Engineer and Port Engineer a service report with data from all testing.  
7.7	Manufacturer's Representative: Converteam (Point of Contact For OEM Services:
Converteam Inc.
