(CEi), located at 5381 Raley Blvd, Sacramento, CA 95838-1701 for procurement of spare components in support of the BQM-167 AFSAT program. These spare components are needed to ensure availability of AFSATs to meet current and projected test and evaluation and training mission requirements. Schedule is critical for the procurement and delivery of spares, and any potential source must be able to deliver these items within the required timeframe to meet critical mission requirements. CEi is able to meet the required time frames and is capable of providing all, not just a subset, of the spares items required. The Government intends to procure the spare components found in Attachment 1.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336413 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.

This NOCA neither constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does it restrict the Government to any specific acquisition approach. This NOCA is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment to a contract by the Government. <br /><br />Contracting POC is Mr. William P. Sahli at 207 West D Avenue, Building 349, Suite 214, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6853 or at William.Sahli.1@us.af.mil. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting point of contact identified above.

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

This is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation packages are not available. The approved J&amp;A will be posted at a later date.</p>

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from the other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (i.e. "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No further price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and that final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.The inclusion of the provision does not mandate use of RA.</p>

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.
Maintenance for the equipment listed below includes all labor, parts, and consumables as identified in the SCOPE section below. Vendor supplies software licensing for Canon, Kodak and Ricoh support, certified technicians for Canon, Kodak and Ricoh color machines, and an average 2 hour on site response time. This shall be reviewed quarterly. In the event the vendor does not meet the average 2 hour response time the vendor shall credit FAA 1 % of the invoiced amount for that quarter. The vendor must be a single point of contact for service and supplies.

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) certified firms, and all other business types and sizes, capable of providing specified Pilot Training.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.  

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 811212, Computer and Office Machine Repair and Maintenance, with a size standard of $25.5 million.  

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

In order to make the determination, the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

1.. Capability Statement - This document should identify:
   Type of services provided by your firm,
   Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (provide detailed information and       past performance)
   Number of years in business

2.  Expected approach - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

All responses to this market survey must be received by 11/19/2014.  All submittals should be submitted by email to Julia.bucher@faa.gov; or mailed to:

<a href="mailto:steven.s.ghazi.civ@mail.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br>  <br> The U.S. Army, Contracting Command - New Jersey, Emerging Technologies Contracting Center is seeking information on disassembly, de-tanking, and disposition alternatives for the fuel and oxidizer materials from Bullpup LR-58 and LR-62 rocket motors. The current missile demil program seeks to identify commercial capabilities for the de-tanking and closed disposal of the fuel and oxidizers materials. The Operational Integration Directorate wishes to use processes, equipment, and facilities that do not require research & development. <br>  <br> A safety and condition assessment (SCA) was conducted on five motors from the current inventory of Bullpup liquid propulsion motors and yielded findings that prohibit static firing as an option for demilitarization and disposal. Two LR-58 motors and three LR-62 motors were analyzed and the data revealed clogged injector orifices from the IRFNA tank as a result of the advanced depletion of the Hydrogen Fluoride inhibitor. The double based solid propellants in the igniter booster and gas generator were analyzed and found to be near spec condition. One LR-58 motor of the subject motors was static test fired as a disposal path finder but yielded unfavorable results due to the injector issues. In the current state, the LR-58 and LR-62 motors are safe to store, handle, and transport. <br>  <br> The Operational Integration Directorate must develop a strategy for the complete demilitarization of the two different versions (LR-58 and LR-62) of the Bullpup rocket motors. The demilitarization will include the following: (1) removal of the solid propellant pressurization system to include the igniter, igniter booster, and asbestos wrapped gas generator, (2) de-tanking of the mixed amine fuel (MAF-1) and inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA), (3) disposition/disposal of the MAF and IRFNA, disposal of the solid propellant, and (4) disposition/disposal of the remaining Bullpup rocket motor case carcass.  <br>  <br> Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: <br> - Technical capability for the complete demilitarization of both versions of the Bullpup rocket motors <br> - Methods for the extraction and disposal of the solid propellants <br> - Methods for the extraction and disposal of the MAF and IFRNA <br> - Disposition of the motor carcass <br> - Approximate cost information <br>  <br> The Government expects to be able to provide approximately190 Bullpup rocket motors (approximately 84 LR-58 motors and approximately 106 LR-62 motors) for demilitarization based on either of the following two general specifications: <br>  <br> See attachment <br>  <br>  <br> The government expects respondents to only address non-developmental approaches/applications for the disposition of the Bullpup rocket motor and constituents. Responses that require R&D projects or facilitization will not satisfy this requirement. All respondents are encouraged to document any assumptions in their responses. <br>  <br> Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with capabilities statements.  Written responses to the RFI shall be no greater than 20 pages in length, describing the concept, capabilities, and limitations.  Submission of proprietary and other sensitive information shall be clearly marked and identified with disposition instructions.  The white paper must be single-sided with double-spaced text, page size no larger than 8.5 by 11 inches, font size no smaller than 12 point, one-inch margins on left, right, and bottom sides, 1.25 inch top margins on all pages.  Submitted material will not be returned.  Multiple RFI responses may be submitted for different technology solutions to the Bullpup LR-58 and LR-62 rocket motors. Responses may be up to the classification level of unclassified. Response should identify their current business structures: company name, size, and address to include contact person's name, telephone numbers (voice and fax) and E-mail address. <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI and all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br> US Army, Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, Emerging Technology Contracting Center <br> ATTN: Steven Ghazi <br> Building 9 Phipps Rd <br> Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806 <br>  <br> Email: steven.s.ghazi.civ@mail.mil <br> Telephone: 973-724-8141

<DESC>Synopsis:  <br>  <br> The United States (U.S.) Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC), Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Aberdeen, MD, 21005, intends to procure seventy-eight (78) Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), AN/TPQ-50 systems to fulfill the Army's Acquisition Objective.  The ACC APG is conducting market research to identify possible sources to produce systems that meet the technical performance requirements of the LCMR AN/TPQ-50 Performance Specification.  <br>  <br> This notice is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Part (FAR) Part 10, Market Research and FAR Part 15, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposal.  This notice serves as a Request for Information (RFI) in support of market research.   All information received will be used for planning purposes only.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation to Bid, a Request for Proposal, or a Request for Quote. The Government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it. <br>  <br> The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is a lightweight, 360-degree, rapidly deployable, man-transportable, digitally connected, day/night mortar locating radar that uses computer-controlled signal processing of the radar signal data to perform target detection, verification, tracking, and classification of enemy and friendly mortars.  It provides simultaneous hostile weapon locations, discrimination and friendly fire observation of mortars, cannons and rockets.  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 has improved range and accuracy for mortars.  It is disassembled into man-portable cases which fit into a single up-armored M1152 or equivalent high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV).  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is assembled and emplaced on or off the vehicle by a two person team.  Interoperability and other performance requirements are delineated in the System Performance Specification.  <br>  <br> The Army is preparing to extend Contract W15P7T-13-D-C702 for an additional two (2) years, a fixed price (FP) production contract awarded in July 2013, or award a new contract vehicle for LCMR AN/TPQ-50 production representative assets and initial spares.  The contract will include cost plus provisions for support; engineering analysis; and assessment and implementation of potential product improvements.  The Government does not possess a build-to-print technical data package (TDP) for the LCMR AN/TPQ-50. <br>  <br> Responses will consist of an unclassified white paper.  At a minimum, the white paper shall provide a description of the technical approach and a statement on the ability to meet these key attributes: <br>  <br> a. Schedule.  Quantities for the additional ordering periods will vary depending on available funding and other factors.  Provide sufficient supporting documentation, to include an integrated schedule showing key events such as contract award, any development and/or facilitization, ramp up, test events and deliveries.  <br>  <br> b. Technical Performance.  Summarize the current, demonstrated capabilities of any existing system that is relevant to the requirements of the LCMR AN/TPQ-50 Performance Specification.  Identify any areas where current systems do not meet the AN/TPQ-50 performance capabilities and what steps, if any, would be required to more fully meet the performance capabilities.  Documentation may include system technical specifications, product brochures and related literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or any other data to support claims.  Responses may discuss types, extent, depth and breadth of analysis and data to substantiate performance claims.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information announcement for market survey purposes only. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this announcement. <br>  <br> Agency: Department of the Army <br> Office: Army Contracting Command - Redstone <br> Location: ACC-RSA - (Aviation) <br> Notice Type:  Request for Information <br>  <br> Synopsis: <br> The U.S. Army Utility Helicopters Project Office (UHPO) is seeking potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to develop a manned/unmanned-operations (MUM-O) capability for the UH/HH-60A/L/M Blackhawk helicopters.  This notification is a Request for Information (RFI) only to support Market Research.  Any responses received will be treated as information only and shall not be used as a proposal.   This RFI is part of a continuous process for obtaining the latest industry information.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government.  It shall not be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to solicit for or award a contract.  The Government will not pay for information solicited.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse any expenses incurred to parties responding to this RFI. <br>  <br> Background:   <br> The proliferation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and other video capable platforms allows an opportunity for the Black Hawk to receive enhanced situational awareness through the receipt and display of real-time full motion video feeds. <br>    <br> This RFI is written to seek input from industry to assist in the design and development of a Black Hawk helicopter mounted system that is capable of receiving full motion video (FMV) from UAS, manned intelligence surveillance reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, and other MUM equipped aerial platforms in the Army inventory. Components are to include a two antenna configuration with a forward antenna for receiving video feeds in front of the aircraft and an aft mounted antenna for receiving video feeds from sources to the rear of the aircraft.  The forward antenna should have maximized range performance.  Further component requirements include FMV receivers with an emphasis on minimizing Size Weight and Power (SWaP). Transmit capability is not an initial requirement of the system. Submission to the RFI need not be a complete system and can be standalone component only solutions (i.e. antenna, receiver) to be further integrated by Black Hawk with additional supplier equipment. The components should be interoperable with platforms using the latest tactical common data link (TCDL) waveform as well as a variety of legacy waveforms still in use by Army assets.  Frequency bands supported should include but are not limited to Ku, C, L, and S bands.  In addition to displaying the live video feed, the system should also display received metadata in a format such as a moving map with icons indicating video source position (i.e. latitude/longitude, heading, altitude) relative to the Black Hawk, sensor field of view, and sensor pointing angle.  <br>     <br> System Capabilities and Attributes: <br> 1.	SWaP <br> a.	Define package size (maximum envelope) <br> b.	Define component weight. Need not include wire weights. <br> c.

<DESC>Partnership Opportunity Document (POD) with NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) for Detectors dated November 2014 General Information <p> Contracting Office Address <p> NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 210.S, Greenbelt, MD 20771 1.0  Introduction and Scope <p> This partnership opportunity is for a NASA Planetary Mission Opportunity in 2014. NASA/GSFC is seeking partners for spaceflight mission development for potential proposals to this opportunity. <p> GSFC mission teams will be submitting proposals to the Discovery announcement currently released.  This opportunity will be two-step processes, with the first proposal response being primarily focused on the scientific merit and technical feasibility of the proposed mission and its associated scientific investigation.  The initial submissions will then be down-selected after formal peer review and the resultant subset of proposals will be funded to perform Phase A mission concept studies.  During Phase A, proposals will be expanded and refined to detail the entire end-to-end life cycle concept, with greater attention to engineering implementation, cost, and schedule. <p> Information on the Discovery AO can be found Science Office for Mission Assessments Discovery 2014 Announcement of Opportunity (<A HREF="http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/index.html">http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/index.htm l </A> ). The time frame for the solicitation is intended to be: <p> 	Release of draft AO......................................July 2, 2014 Release of final AO......................................November 5, 2014 Preproposal conference...............................~3 weeks after final AO release Proposals due..............................................February 5, 2015 Selection for competitive Phase A studies...May 2015 (target) Concept study reports due...........................April 2016 (target) Down-selection............................................October 2016 (target) Launch readiness date.................................NLT December 31, 2021 <p> This partnership opportunity is being issued to interested and qualified teaming partners to help prepare the NASA/GSFC concept for proposal submittal and to provide a flight qualified instrument subsystem should the instruments be selected for flight. This partnership opportunity is for the development, integration, test and delivery of detectors. <p> For this partnership opportunity dealing with the preparation of the initial submission, there will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners.  Funding will be available for Phase A and subsequent phases should the investigation be approved to continue through the mission-defined gates for flight.	NASA/GSFC reserves the option to not select any teaming partners under this POD offering on the basis of materials received. 2.0 Technical Description <p> Desired spaceflight system - GSFC is interested in finding a partner to provide spaceflight-qualified Detectors.  No other subsystems are part of this POD. <p> Detailed information on the Detector specifications will be provided to those responding with a Notice of Interest.  A Notice of Interest (intentionally not called a notice of intent) does not obligate an organization to provide a POD response. 3.0 Pre-selection Support <p> 3.1 Initial Proposal Support SOW:  It is expected that the selected respondent will provide support using their own resources (no exchange of funds) to help develop and write the mission proposal in response to the solicitations in the area of the detector design and mission implementation.  This will involve meeting with the scientists and the overall mission engineering team:  (a) to help define the end-to-end performance and interface requirements; (b) to identify study topics; and (c) to predict performance.  This will include cost estimation for each and all mission phases.  The period of performance for this interval is expected to last until submission of the initial proposal. 	 3.2 Phase A Study and Phase A Proposal Support <p> SOW: If the mission is selected for a Phase A study, the proposal team will receive funding to conduct a Phase A study and submit a detailed Concept Study Report (CSR) to NASA.  The respondent providing the detectors will be allocated a portion of this total to continue proposal support during the CSR duration.  The respondent will be expected to contribute to designing, documenting, and costing the detectors for inclusion in the final Concept Study Report.  The period of performance for this interval is detailed in the above timelines. POD Response Instructions for Pre-Selection Support <p> The respondent shall: <p> 1)	Demonstrate understanding and experience in the design, fabrication, integration and testing of detectors: 	Identify the means of addressing system requirements that your team assumes are likely to exist and tasks the detectors are intended for, 	Highlight particularly critical or challenging areas for the design of the detectors, 	Provide a technical summary/description of the proposed hardware including relevant heritage with cost information. <p> 2)	Identify any recommended potential study topics related to the detectors, including radiation tolerance. <p> 3)	Indicate the level of resources to be allocated for the proposal phase. 	Discuss skills that will be provided, the appropriate level of conceptual design, and analyses and trade studies to be performed. <p> 4) Identify pertinent missions for which the respondent has previously provided support for proposal writing in the area of detector design, fabrication, integration and testing for the technical specifications listed. <p> 4.0 Development Support <p> SOW:  Following CSR submittal, if the mission is selected for development and launch, the respondent will be responsible for the design, development, and test of the detectors. The respondent is responsible for:  identifying the detector requirements and providing all aspects of the detectors (either directly, or through purchasing or teaming arrangements).	The period of performance for this interval is expected to last approximately 46-66 months.  The date will depend upon selection timelines and budget allocations. POD Response Instructions for Development Support The respondent shall: <p> 1)	Describe the level of experience with similar detectors and level of experience of supporting personnel. 2)	Identify available design and modeling capabilities required to support development of the detectors. 3)	Identify fabrication and testing facilities that will be required to support development and test of the detectors. 4)	Identify a level of sustaining engineering to assist in potential anomaly resolution during instrument and observatory environmental testing 5)	Identify which missions the respondent has successfully supported (relevant to this POD and its technology) and provide a customer reference point of contact. 	Provide information on recent similar detectors designed and delivered, and describe how that experience is applicable to this mission.  This shall include basic information on scope of work, how well the delivered detectors met the cost and schedule estimates, and technical requirements. 6)	Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and timeline for the scope of the design, fabrication, and testing of the detectors. This ROM will not be considered a binding commitment, but will serve as a consideration during the partnership evaluation.  Due to the rigid cost cap for these opportunities, the cost range for the detectors will be an important consideration.  Cost savings for providing both sets of filters will receive strong consideration.  The respondent is invited to comment on the reasonableness of the placeholder cost. 7)	List ideas and methods of keeping costs low and the risk of cost growth low, including how to utilize existing open market hardware to minimize costs and provide a more robust system. 5.0 General Instructions for POD Response <p> Potential respondents are asked to contact the GSFC team with a Notice Of Interest (intentionally not called a notice of intent).	This Notice of Interest does not create an obligation to respond to the POD, but allows the GSFC team to disseminate additional details to provide answers to questions from potential partners. Notice of Interest respondents will receive a document containing additional details on the Detector specifications, which can be used to facilitate a focused response to the partnership opportunity.  These details are competition sensitive and are not to be shared outside the teams necessary to prepare a full response. <p> After receipt of the mission document, respondents may send questions to the GSFC point of contact (POC) listed below.	All questions and answers will be made available to all those who respond to the Notice of Interest.  The source of the questions shall be held confidential.  Questions and answers that contain information unique to a respondents proprietary approach will not be shared if they are identified as such.  <p> Notice of Interest shall be sent to the POC listed below via email with Notice of Interest in the subject line, a simple sentence or two expressing interest and an email address to send further information. <p> For purposes of this partnership opportunity, the contact is Michael Adams, <a href="mailto:Michael.L.Adams@nasa.gov">Michael.L.Adams@nasa.gov </a> , 301.286.2010. <p> Responses to the POD shall: <p> 1)	Be in a presentation format that shall not exceed 20 pages.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Contracts Department (AIR 2.5.1.3), Patuxent River, MD is posting this Sources Sought to determine the interest in this requirement and announces its intention to procure on a competitive basis the services necessary to provide support to NAWCAD Integrated Communications and Information Systems (ICIS) Division (4.11.3), for the design, development, integration, acquisition, training, test and evaluation, installation, fielding, certification, maintenance, logistics support, and Modernization of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat and Intelligence (C5I) systems (C5I Modernization) which meet the requirements of the Department of Defense (DoD) and Federal/Government Agencies.</p>
<p><br />ACQUISITION HISTORY</p>
<p>This procurement was previously synopsized in the Seaport-e portal to all eligible Zone 2 business firms on 18 September 2013. Capability statements were requested via the Seaport-e portal from all Zone 2, large and small businesses interested in the procurement by 3 October 2013.</p>
<p>The Government did not host an Industry Day and does not intend to host an Industry Day.</p>
<p>The Government uploaded a draft RFP (N00024-13-R-3474) including a draft copy of Attachment 1 - Non-Performance Based Statement of Work, Personnel Qualifications and LOE into the Seaport-e portal in September 2013 and requested feedback/comments from Industry. Two (2) questions were received and the Government provided responses to the questions. A copy of the draft RFP (N00024-13-R-3474) including a draft copy of Attachment 1 - Non-Performance Based Statement of Work, Personnel Qualifications and LOE along with the questions and answers that were posted in the Seaport-e portal are available for review in this notice. These documents are in draft form and should not be utilized for planning/preparation purposes.</p>
<p>The Government's acquisition strategy has changed and now the Government intends to procure these services outside of Seaport-e and is interested in determining if any additional small or large businesses are interested in the C5I Modernization procurement. All large and small businesses that are interested should send in a capability statement. OFFERORS WHO PREVIOUSLY RESPONDED NEED NOT RESPOND. This Sources Sought is a market research tool and the results will be used to determine potential sources.</p>
<p>The attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) provides additional information about the required tasking. If your company has any questions about the structure of the PWS, or areas that may need further definition, please also identify those in the response.</p>
<p>Since the resultant contract will be a cost-type effort, the successful awardee will also be required to have a Government-approved accounting system upon contract award.<br /><br />The results of the Sources Sought will be utilized to determine if any Small Business Set-Aside opportunities exist. All Small Business Set-Aside categories will be considered. This Sources Sought will also be utilized to identify that adequate competition exists among large businesses if this is not a Small Business Set-Aside.</p>

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing market research to identify the capabilities of firms that can provide support to the EPA's Office of Water by providing support for the National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS). NARS was developed in response to the Government Accountability Office and other independent reviews calling for improved water monitoring and reporting. The NARS are designed using state-of-the art survey techniques to randomly select sites to represent the conditions of aquatic resources at multiple spatial scales. Field crews use the same and often innovative protocols at all sites to ensure that results are nationally comparable. For many of the indicators selected for research purposes, scientists analyze the results against reference conditions derived from water bodies judged to have been the least disturbed by human activities. This survey and continuing research program provides statistically valid data and information vital to describi ng water resource quality conditions across the country, how these conditions vary with geographic setting, and the extent of human and natural influences.
It is anticipated that the contract will be an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) multiple award contract with firm fixed price and cost plus fixed fee task orders with an ordering period of 5 years.  Approximately 74,700 LOE hours are anticipated for the ordering period. The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $15 million in average annual receipts. In the capabilities statements, contractors must provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women owned, small disadvantaged and/or service disabled veteran owned concern.  The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (See FAR 52.219 14) under a procurement set aside for small businesses.

<DESC>Description: The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:  <br>  <br> This project will be for the construction of Visiting Quarters located at Scott Air Force Base, IL.  Project will include construction of approximately 171,000 square feet of space, and construction of some exterior pavements. The facility will include HVAC, power, lighting, plumbing, fire protection and suppression systems, interior partitions, and other architectural systems.   <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br>  <br> (2) Be consistent with law.  <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.  <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:  <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Louisville District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisville District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?  <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?  <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?  <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?  <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.  <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?  <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?  <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to bjorn.t.hale@usace.army.mil no later than 1000 HRS ET on 02 December 2014.  <br>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VAMC Jamaica Plain, located at 150 South Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02130, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements with EndoChoice, of Alpharetta, GA, for the lease for a base plus 4 option years, regarding the EndoChoice 510(k) Fuse Colonoscopy system. This requirement will include the following characteristics: 
Product Description
EndoChoice, became the only FDA approved company having a Fuse Endoscopy System. This is the only known company that can provide the only such medical equipment providing a full 330 degree view of the colon. With this system, the endoscopists can see almost twice as much anatomy as with traditional endoscopes. The Fuse system (510k cleared) is a proprietary new endoscope system unlike any other endoscopy system on the market.  This system allows clinicians to see more of the GI Tract as described above. The Fuse endoscopy system provides an expanded field of view made possible by using LED lighting and multiple imager rather than one. This system handles just like traditional endoscopes but projects the expanded view on three screens giving the endoscopists previously unseen views, such as behind colonic folds and difficult anatomy. This is essential to the goal of the VA to provide the best and innovative medical equipment available in order give our Veterans the best possible medical care. There has been excellent feedback regarding this system and it is imperative for patient care continuity and patient care equipment standardization for both staff and patients that we make this essential procurement. 
This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than 11/17/2014 @ 12:00pm. Responses should be sent to James.Corbett2@va.gov. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

                               Estimated Grand Total for this Consignment Contract ___________________?

B.  CONSIGNMENT TERMS

B.1. 	GENERAL:  Contractor agrees to furnish and maintain an inventory of Heart Valves/supplies outlined in the attached inventory list at the Saint Louis VAMC.  Products will be placed in the facility on a consignment basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract and the consignment terms stated herein.

B.2.	INVENTORY LEVEL:  An initial level of consignment inventory to be placed at the Saint Louis VAMC shall be agreed to by the Surgery Department and the Contractor.  However, this level may be changed upon mutual agreement of the parties if requirements change.  The VA Inventory Manager for Prosthetics will verify the contractors proposed consignment level as acceptable.  A "no charge" purchase order may be required to initiate shipment of initial stock of inventory.  Initial consignment inventory shall be placed, at no expense to the Government, at Saint Louis VAMC within 10 calendar days after receipt of Consignment Level Agreement.  The Contractor shall provide a complete listing of model and/or part numbers upon delivery of the initial inventory.

B.3.	MAINTENANCE OF INVENTORY:  All consignment inventories shall be coordinated with designated station POC.  The facility will consume Contractor's product at the catalog number level on a first-in, first-out basis.  Contractor shall remove or replace inventory as necessary.  The Contractor shall advise the designated station POC prior to removing or replacing inventory.  Designated station POC may request that inventory having less than 30 days sterility/expiration date be removed and replaced.  The Contractor shall assume responsibility of all expired products.  Replacement of expired inventory will fall in accordance with the timeframes outlined in section B.6. of this document.  These services shall be completed at no cost to the Government.  Contractor is required to furnish the designated station POC an inventory listing with serial and/or lot numbers in order to track patient implants within 15 days.

B.4.	SEMI-ANNUAL REVIEW OF INVENTORY:  In order to determine appropriate stock levels, VA Surgery and VA Prosthetics inventory management staff and contractor's personnel will periodically (at least twice per year) conduct a physical inventory of the consignment inventory, with copy of inventory furnished to the VA Contracting Office.  Contractor shall evaluate the actual usage and purchase volume vs. the expected turns, and review the results with designated VA representative at the facility.  Inventory levels may be adjusted accordingly if required.

B.5.	OWNERSHIP AND LIABILITY:  The ownership of all consigned items shall remain with the Contractor until such time said item(s) are used by the Government.  The Government assumes no ownership for any item(s) assigned to the VA on a consignment basis until such time a requirement for the item(s) exists and item is used or implanted.  At that time, a purchase order will be issued for a replacement item.  Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement due to causes beyond the control of such party, including but not limited to fire, floods, other act of God, accidents, embargoes, wars, riots and any other acts or order of any government or governmental agency.  The VA shall furnish proper storage and security for the consignment inventory and shall be responsible for any loss, theft, or damage to consigned items while in the VA's possession or control.

B.6.	PURCHASE ORDERS/ORDERING REPLACEMENT INVENTORY:  The use of any item is entirely dependent on patient diagnosis and need as determined by the attending physician.  Contractor will be required to provide products on an as-needed basis.  Contractor will be paid only after items are implanted or used by the Government.  A purchase order will be issued by the Saint Louis VAMC and sent to the vendor within one (1) business days for each implanted or used item in order to obtain a replacement item and shall include model, size, serial/lot number.  Products will be replaced at the prices indicated in the Schedule of items in Section B.

Agreement:	

1.	Scope of Work:  This contract reflects the tasks associated with the bioinformatics support for the VA VISN 5 Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) research investigators. The vendor will 1) create data elements for research studies; 2) create acceptable data forms for data collection; and 3) maintain the HIPAA compliant Integrated Research Information System (IRIS) database(s) for data related to all MIRECC Investigator research projects.

2.	Background: The MIRECC research investigators must have a system and process to collect and store research participant data.  This process and the database was created through an earlier contract/agreement with the University of Maryland, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Bioinformatics Core (BC) who now maintains active ongoing MIRECC research data in a database.  

3.	Objectives:  This Statement of Work describes data collection, database creation and management services defined as follows:
  
a.	Creation and maintenance of study specific data dictionary to include naming conventions, definitions and ranges for data dictionary items;
b.	Implementation of the database will include development of relational data tables to accommodate each data component;
c.	Ensure the full capability of the TeleForm Application to scan, review, validate, edit, and approve data items prior to entry into the system; 
d.	Maintain the HIPAA compliant de-identified database server, its operating system and software related to the system;
e.	Maintain strict standards for granting users access to its servers and systems.  


4.	Work Requirements:  The contractor shall perform the following functions:

a.	 Maintenance of study database- 
i.	The vendor  will maintain the HIPAA compliant database(s) for data related to all MIRECC Investigator research projects which will include the following tasks:
1.	The vendor will create a data dictionary that provides details about each data item and acceptable ranges and limits of these items. These items will be in a format suitable to provide adequate documentation for the MIRECC staff to develop reports or conduct data analyses. The MIRECC staff will provide naming conventions, definitions and ranges for data dictionary items to the vendor staff, if available. If no definitions are available, the vendor will develop these after consultation with MIRECC personnel.
2.	The implementation of the database will include development of relational data tables to accommodate each data component. The vendor will set up a link that will allow SAS, SPSS, STATA, Excel or Access to directly access read only de-identified study data from the database to MIRECC staff who have been granted rights by the Principle Investigator (PI) or Co-PI. The MIRECC PI or Co-PI will determine who has access to this link and then provide the vendor with documentation (form provided by the vendor) of HIPAA and VA training compliance. The vendor will create views such that identified MIRECC staff will have read rights to de-identified data pertaining to each study according to the roles that are set for study personnel. Study personnel roles will be determined by the Principal Investigator for each study. 
3.	Specifically for each project, the vendor will create views such that the MIRECC staff may access specific data sets that are held in the database via software specifically created by the vendor. The interface will have unique components in consultation with VA regulations and HIPAA compliant security.
4.	The vendor will attend information exchange meetings as needed. MIRECC staff will contact any outside data coordination centers directly for specifications of data management requirements or regulations for this project. The MIRECC staff will be responsible for informing the vendor staff of these specifications. The vendor personnel will provide a Security Assessment Report documenting the findings from a Security Control Assessment, as needed in addition to the Annual Information Systems Security Plan.
5.	The vendor staff will be available by appointment to any authority identified by MIRECC staff for audit of the study database.

1.	The vendor will ensure the full capability of the TeleForm System (data entry forms) to scan, review, validate, edit, and approve data items prior to entry into the system. The MIRECC staff will be responsible for having access to IBM compatible computers, with a minimum of Windows XP operating system.
2.	The vendor will be available during normal working hours (8:00am to 4:30pm) to assist MIRECC staff with operational issues. In the event that the system becomes inoperable, the vendor  will investigate and repair problems in the TeleForm system at no cost to the VA. 
3.	The vendor will also provide the ability to view an electronic image (which can be printed for source document) of the data collection forms to help resolve errors or problems. The vendor will provide these if MIRECC staff do not have the appropriate equipment. 

b.	Data - The MIRECC data stored in the Integrated Research Information System (IRIS) shall not contain any of the 18 HIPPAA Protected Health Information (PHI) elements, nor any other data that can be construed as identifiable singularly or in conjunction with other variables.  The link file that contains the connection between the identifying number used to store data in IRIS and personally identifying information will be kept behind the VA firewall by MIRECC staff.  

c.	Design and development of scan able forms - 
i.	The vendor will develop TeleForm data collection forms according to specifications provided by MIRECC staff. The vendor may use existing TeleForm templates in the development of study-specific forms. The development of TeleForm forms may include up to three sessions for review of draft forms and amendments to the forms.
ii.	The vendor will have in place procedures for testing the data collection form before it goes into production and will provide documentation of this to the MIRECC investigator upon request. The vendor will perform quality control procedures to test the accuracy of the first 10 records of each new table to verify that the data is going in correctly. If the MIRECC staff responds with corrected data via QC reports, the vendor will implement the corrections bringing the error rate closer to 0%.

d.	Systems Support - The vendor  staff will also provide the following support:
i.	House and provide internet-based access to the de-identified database for MIRECC staff;
ii.	Maintain the HIPAA compliant de-identified database server, its operating system and software related to the system;
iii.	Maintain the HIPAA compliant study database, implement user accounts, and maintain daily database backups;
iv.	Provide access to MSQL Server and MySQL tools needed to support the above information management functions;
v.	Provide access to a central TeleForm server that will digitize and verify data entered at a web page, sent by fax, or paper forms and send this data to the database;
vi.	Provide a contact during normal working hours that will be able to troubleshoot problems in the system and bring the system back on line, if necessary; and
vii.	Provide access to periodic reports (Excel spreadsheets) on the accumulation of records in a table at intervals determined by the MIRECC investigator or staff.

e.	The vendor agrees to provide a high standard of professional service and perform the aforementioned tasks within the time and funds available for the center. The vendor also agrees to maintain, as confidential, all information furnished by MIRECC staff and designated as such, except for any information that is already in the public domain.

f.	Quality Standards - The vendor will maintain strict standards for granting users access to its servers and systems.  

i.	A user will be granted an account in IRIS and access to a particular protocol only through written authorization of the principal investigator (PI) for the study, or their designated administrator.  Every PI or administrator maintains full control over the list of users and roles in IRIS related to their protocol.  
ii.	IRIS will use Oracle 10 g database management system (DBMS) and reside on a secure server behind a firewall in a special HIPPAA user's zone.  Backups will be made daily and each month a backup tape will be stored in a secure off-site location.
iii.	Security measures to prevent unauthorized access, including mandatory periodic password changes and automatic logoff from inactive connections will be part of the system.
iv.	All changes to data collected on the study forms will be restricted to specific personnel.  An audit log will be maintained which contains the previous value, the new value and the reason for the change.  

5.	Description of Tasks and Associated Deliverables - 

a.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The United States Government's (USG's) Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative promotes sound legal, regulatory, and institutional environments--or enabling environments--that increase private sector investment and expand markets and trade, leading to better food security and nutrition outcomes that drive long-term gains and sustainability. A sound enabling environment is a condition for economic growth in the agricultural sector. Research that compares the Green Revolution in Asia to agricultural development in Sub-Saharan Africa finds that institutional change, which led to a transparent state, functioning markets, and farmer organizations that represent the interests of family farmers, explains much of the agricultural success seen in Asia (Biggs, 2007; Djurfeldt et al, 2005).  When the transaction costs of essential business functions are reduced through improved enabling environments, conditions are created along agricultural value chains that can stimulate trade and investment and expand market opportunities for smallholders. At the same time, informal institutions (i.e. social norms and values that govern individual and collective behavior, including gender dimensions) interact with formal rules to affect agricultural value chain development. Changes to enabling environments will lead to trade-offs, shifting costs and benefits within a society, affecting different groups within a community in different ways. Sustained gains in food security and nutrition will require improved agribusiness enabling environments that both enhance legal and regulatory frameworks for doing business in the agricultural sector, but also consider how these formal rule changes shift costs and benefits within a society.  An improved enabling environment for agriculture and nutrition will: 1) reduce costs of doing business in the agricultural sector along key value chains, 2) reduce the degree of uncertainty that value chain actors face about their ability to profit in the future from investment decisions made now, 3) create the conditions for sustainable reform, and 4) increase trust and predictability among actors along agricultural value chains.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The Project Objective for the Enabling Environment for Food Security award is to support USAID field missions and USAID Washington through targeted approaches for diagnosing and addressing enabling environment factors. The Project will effectively respond to Mission requests for technical assistance by being adaptable and able to tailor analytical methodologies and activities to specific geographic and value chain contexts. The general Project approach will consist of designing and implementing analytical activities for USAID Washington and field Missions, building USAID and host country capacity for integrating enabling environment concepts in strategic programming, and managing the knowledge generated from these activities.</p>
<p>Successful implementation of this Project will require a mix of skills and capabilities, including: analytical and evaluation skills; education and training capability; and country logistical and Project implementation capacity. Offerors will have skills to effectively and efficiently manage limited funding and have necessary flexibility, as work plans are developed in response to demand and interest from Mission clients and as the Project and country development programs evolve. The Offeror must have the ability to match the different needs and opportunities that arise in different geographic and technical areas with expertise and capacities of possible STTA consultants.  Applicants should ensure that management systems are flexible and able to respond to changing needs as the Project progresses and as needs and opportunities are identified.<br /> <br />The scale of activities under this Project will depend on the availability of USAID funding and the demand for assistance for diagnostic, analytical, technical, and capacity building support. Project activities will be defined and approved in Annual Work plans and become more specific as Mission's define Scopes of Work and field support buy-ins to the project.</p>
<p>The project will generate information that will strengthen legal and institutional frameworks that create the conditions to achieve Feed the Future goals. Project activities will include targeted commercial, legal and institutional analysis, implementation support, knowledge management, capacity building, and thought leadership on how to enable institutional change that contributes to inclusive agricultural growth and improved nutrition. The project will lead to increased effectiveness of projects designed to foster institutional changes that benefit actors along key agricultural value chains, in particular, men and women smallholders, support implementation of regional harmonization efforts at the country level, as well as the longer-term interest of FTF focus, priority, and aligned countries.</p>
<p>PROJECT TASKS/ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>The Enabling Environment for Food security Project will have four components. Activities are expected to benefit Missions, including USAID Washington, developing country policymakers, actors along key agricultural value chains, development practitioners from NGOs, and other donors. Activities will be relevant to country programs responding to new challenges of enhancing food security and climate change.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a majority of activities performed under this contract will involve financial contributions from participating USAID Mission projects. The Contactor is expected to be responsive to USAID mission demands for technical assistance.  The Contractor will perform the following activities listed below.</p>
<p>Component 1.	Technical Analysis and Targeted Technical Assistance:<br /><br />The Contractor will analyze legal, regulatory and institutional factors and prioritize actionable recommendations and options to assist in strategic programming and project design and to achieve regional and country level objectives.  Analysis will be conducted using existing diagnostic tools (e.g. Commercial, Legal, Institutional and Regulations (CLIR) methodology, political economy framework) or through the development of custom analytical frameworks as needed. For example, agribusiness enabling environment (AgBEE) benchmarking data generated through the Agricultural Regulations and Institutions (AGRI) Index pilot implemented through USAID's Enabling Agricultural Trade (EAT) project and a comparative data set generated through the Benchmarking the Business of Agriculture (BBA) project , will be ready for benchmarking and comparative analysis purposes in FY15. These datasets represent an opportunity for USAID Missions to undertake deeper analysis of specific AgBEE factors, utilizing AgBEE tools. The Contractor will also be requested to provide analytical support that will assist approximately 30% of FTF Missions with implementing scaling plans.</p>
<p>Once a USAID Mission in a FTF country has requested an interest in buying into the Enabling Environment for Food Security project, the Project will work with Missions to define the scope of the buy-in activity, estimate a budget and a timeframe for implementation. When field Missions buy in, assignments will typically include a desk study component and a 2-3 week in-country component for further data collection comprised of field work by a small team that includes key stakeholder interviews, and triangulation to confirm findings in interviews.</p>
<p>Component 2.	Knowledge Management: <br /><br /> Analytical findings and knowledge the Contractor generates will become valuable when it is shared and managed. The Contractor will prepare technical briefs that expand and improve USAID Mission understanding and use of activities that promote improved enabling environments for food security. The Contractor will contribute to the knowledge base on how laws, regulations, and social norms interact to create different institutional outcomes, integrating cross-cutting themes, such as gender, climate change, and nutrition. Thought leadership also includes developing improved indicators for monitoring and evaluating enabling environment projects to assist missions with measuring performance. Thought leadership and knowledge management will lead to improved understanding about how enabling environment factors affect FTF programming. The Contractor will work closely with USAID to accomplish the following:</p>
<p>a.	Utilize existing on-line gateways to knowledge generated in <br />support of the USG Feed the Future Initiative.<br />b.	Support USAID field mission and Washington staff with the development of materials for public presentations.<br />c.	Conduct public presentations, including on-line events, such as webinars, related to <br />assessments and other activities carried out through the project.</p>
<p>Component 3.	Capacity Building:  <br /><br />An improved enabling environment requires that government, the private sector, and civil society have the capacity to fulfill their distinct roles in devising, implementing, and monitoring reform efforts. The Contractor will design and conduct training for USAID staff on food security enabling environment topics to enhance the ability of Regional and Bilateral Missions to follow through with recommendations generated through technical analysis and stakeholder led processes. Trainings could range from one hour to a few days and will take place in Washington or field locations. The Project will work with USAID/BFS staff to identify training needs and timing of training. An estimated two trainings a year will take place.</p>
<p>Component 4.	Implementation Support: <br /><br />Experience has shown that Missions often need support to follow through on the actionable recommendations generated through analytical work. The Contractor will provide missions with on-site short -term technical assistance (STTA) as needed to achieve country and regional objectives. The duration of on-site, full-time STTA could range from two weeks to twelve months. STTA could include embedded advisors in country or regional organizations to provide support to implementation of actionable recommendations generated from Technical Analysis, further stakeholder consultations, partner requests, presentation of findings, expert review of agricultural laws, or other interventions as identified. Implementation support could also include assisting Missions with integrating cross-cutting themes, such as gender, into follow-up actions. Importantly, the Contractor could provide support to monitor and evaluate the progress and impact from enabling environment activities. It is anticipated that at least eight of the 22 FTF focus and aligned countries will require implementation support over the life of the project based on past and current demand.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Keysight Technologies E8257N Analog Signal Generator with additional upgrades. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334515: Instrument Manufacturing for Measuring and Testing Electricity and Electrical Signals. Business size standard for NAICS 334515 is 500 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is Technical Communities, Inc., 1111 Bayhill Dr Ste 400, San Bruno, CA 94066-3043. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Monday, 17 Nov 2014, 1200 EST. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires Technical Communities, Inc. to provide Keysight Technologies E8257N Analog Signal Generator because they are the only known source that distributes and sells this product with all necessary upgrades. The Keysight Technologies E8257N Analog Signal Generator is the only known product capable of meeting all necessary mission requirements. This equipment is replacing an older E8257N unit. Testing has already been completed using the older unit and in order for data and results to remain consistent, AFRL/RXCC needs to continue using the E8257N product including necessary upgrades/enhancements. Utilizing a different piece of equipment would incur a substantial duplication of cost requiring the rerunning of several tests while retraining for the new equipment, all at the government's expense. Below are the specifications that are required and met by the Keysight Technologies E8257N Analog Signal Generator, including necessary upgrades/enhancements.</p>
<p>-Adjustable Power Output up to +11 dBm (+17 dBm from 3.2 to 17 GHz)<br />-Amplitude, Frequency, Phase, and Pulse Modulation Capability<br />-Maximum deviation for Frequency Modulation must be at least 4 MHz, 8 MHz, 16 MHz, and 32 MHz in the 1-2, 2-3.2, 3.2-10, and 10-20 GHz frequency ranges, respectively.<br />-Analog Ramp Sweep Capability<br />-Pulse modulation on/off ratio must be at least 80 dB, with rise/fall times &lt;20 ns, &lt;15 ns, and &lt;10 ns in the 10 - 50 MHz, 50 - 400 MHz, and &gt; 400 MHz ranges, respectively.<br />-Step Attenuator Capability<br />-Miniumum Power Output of -135 dBm<br />-Maximum operating temperature no lower than 50 degrees Celsius</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to daniel.bresnahan.1@us.af.mil no later than Monday, 17 Nov 2014, 1200 EST. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "Analog Signal Generator". Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the NHLBI is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.

This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D)(2)(i). This announcement and any modifications to this announcement will be open through 13 November 2015 in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps). White Papers (WP) and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. WPs (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by a panel of government experts using the following criteria: Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and potential contributions to the Navy Propulsion, Power and Energy objectives to include (1) relevance to the stated technology areas of interest; (2) anticipated operational military (or commercial, if applicable) utility; (3) ability of proposed system/study to be rapidly ready for transition; (4) suitability for transition to Navy systems; and (5) projected affordability of transitioning the technology to the fleet Other evaluation criteria, of lesser importance but equal to each other are; The offeror's capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives and the realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing. No further criteria will be used in the evaluation. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds. Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated. Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Specific reporting requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award. At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report. Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals or White Papers (WP) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate. BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - WPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM. Cost estimates in WPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged. Offerors of those WPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal. One original, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted. WPs and Proposals shall be submitted to: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547, Bldg 120-180, Code 2.5.2.3.2, Attn: Jillian Kohler, jillian.kohler@navy.mil , Contract Specialist, Lakehurst, NJ 08733. One soft copy will shall be submitted to <a href="mailto:jillian.kohler@navy.mil">jillian.kohler@navy.mil</a>.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession. (o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Public Laws 108-77 and 108-78 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)). (b) The Contractor shall comply with the FAR clauses in this paragraph (b) that the Contracting Officer has indicated as being incorporated in this contract by reference to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (Contracting Officer check as appropriate.) <BR> <BR>[] (21)(i) 52.219-23, Notice of Price Evaluation Adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (OCT 2008) (10 U.S.C. 2323)(if the offeror elects to waive the adjustment, it shall so indicate in its offer.)

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is HSTS07-15-R-00004 which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This requirement will be an UNRESTRICTED acquisition. The proposed contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) one year options. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699. Services anticipated to begin on or about JANUARY 1, 2015.
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firearms range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training. NOTE: THE RANGE MUST BE AN ESTABLSIHED RANGE; THIS IS NOT A REQUEST TO BUILD A RANGE. The range shall be outdoor within a 40 mile radius of the Denver Metro Area. The proposed range must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:</p>
<p>DHS will provide all AMMUNITION, TARGETS and FIREARMS INSTRUCTORS. The range time must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the hours indicated. The range must be able to accommodate 25 shooters, a minimum of four days per month. Each shooter will fire approximately 250 rounds per day.</p>
<p>The range shall possess adequate exterior lighting in both public and work areas. The range shall be equipped with separate male and female indoor restroom facilities with running water located near the range facilities for DHS use. It shall have parking available on site for a minimum of 25 shooters at one time. A classroom to accommodate a minimum of 25 students should be available onsite along with a break room.</p>
<p>The target system for the range should be a turning target system. A bullet trap shall exist on the range. The facility should offer different levels of lighting, low light and no light. The range owner will be responsible for lead recovery at the range.</p>
<p>Two 7'x 6'x 8' storage units are required at the range site. There will be no fees for on-site pad space for the storage units. Special targets, aircraft seats, ammunition, and other range equipment may be stored in these on-site units.</p>
<p>DHS personnel will use the range an average of 4 days per month (4 days X 12 months = 48 days per year/4 quarters) with an estimated 20 shooters per day. The estimated number of rounds fired per year is 240,000 (based on 20 shooters per day X 250 rounds per shooter X 48 days). The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours. Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range in 4 hour blocks from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM. This does not include weekends and federal holidays.</p>
<p>The range must be in compliance with all Federal, State and OSHA regulations governing firing ranges. If an award is granted and the range is found not in accordance with regulations, the Government has the unilateral right to terminate contract at any time via written signed modification.</p>
<p>Proposed Site Inspection</p>
<p>As part of the proposal evaluation process, TSA reserves the right to inspect all proposed sites to ensure compliance with all requirements set forth above.</p>
<p>The proposed contract will be for (1) base year and (4) four one-year options. The solicitation incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if given in full text. Full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov/far. The following provisions in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) apply to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers Commercial Items (July 2013) and the clause at FAR.52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Sep 2013) apply to this acquisition. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition. Additional clauses applicable to this acquisition are listed later in this document.</p>
<p>At a minimum, offerors proposals shall include the following sections: (1) Qualification Statement, (2) Past Performance references, and (3) Price. The proposals will be evaluated using the factors as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Technical Factors</p>
<p>(1) Qualification Statement. Offeror shall confirm in writing that they meet all requirements set forth in this solicitation/synopsis. However, DHS reserves the right to visit proposed site(s) to verify that the range(s) meets minimum qualifications.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance History. The offeror's proposal shall include a minimum of (2) past performance references for similar services the offeror has provided. One of these references must be a law enforcement entity. Verified/current points of contact shall be provided for each reference to allow the Government to speak with references about the nature and quality of service required.<br />(b) Price Factors</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide pricing to cover a (1) year base period and (4) one year options. Pricing should be proposed on 4 hour blocks. Contractors will be permitted to bill on a monthly basis for hours used during the month. Invoice to be submitted only once a month.</p>
<p>All evaluation factors, when combined, are more important than price. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation only if it can be determined that the responsible offerors proposal, conforming to the solicitation, will provide the most advantageous solution to the Government requirement, considering price and other factors. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract in response to this solicitation if it determines that none of the offers received provide the best value to the Government. In such a case, the Government will not be liable for any bid or proposal costs. Award may be made only to a contractor who has registered with the System for Award Management at https://www.sam.gov (formally CCR) prior to contract award. Additionally, offerors are advised that the following clause will pertain to any contract award: Release of Information: The Contractor shall not disclose, advertise, or release information about this contract to any individual or organization without prior written approval from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>PRICE SHEET</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide pricing to cover a (1) year base period and (4) one year options. Options will be evaluated at time of award. Pricing must be quoted on a 4 hour block basis. Pricing for the base year and 4 term option years must be submitted as follows:</p>
<p><br />Base Year and Four Options:</p>
<p>Base Year:</p>

<p>Option Year One:</p>

<p>January 1, 2019 - December 31, 2019 <br />48 days @4 hour blocks <br />Price per 4 hour block = _____________ X 48 = ___________</p>
<p><br />Offerors are reminded to submit pricing for all years. A proposal submitted without pricing for a base and four one year term options will be considered technically non-responsive and may be removed from consideration for award.</p>
<p>Contractors will be permitted to bill on a monthly basis for hours used during the month. Invoice to be submitted only once a month.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order and may award without discussions. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation only if it can be determined that the responsible offerors proposal, conforming to the solicitation, will provide the most advantageous solution to the Government requirement, considering price and other factors. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract in response to this solicitation if it determines that none of the offers received provide the best value to the Government. In such a case, the Government will not be liable for any bid or proposal costs.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award, the offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Nov 2013), with its quote. An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of the provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>52-215-1 (4) Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> Requisition Number W81EWF43008392 and W81EWF42967800 are being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) with the intent to award as a simplified acquisition.  The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-77.  This requirement is a 100% set-aside for Small Business Concerns under NAICS Code 424710 (SIC 5171) with a size standard of 100 Employees. All cost associated with delivery to Range 19, Fort Polk, LA shall be included in the quote.   <br>  <br> The Impact and Explosion Effects Branch (IEEB) has a requirement to purchase off-   road diesel fuel in support of multiple programs: the CALDERA, FERRET, and VBIED programs, funded by the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) and efforts funded by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), including the Red Zone projects.  The work being performed by the IEEB for each of these programs fall within the mission of the Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory (GSL) and the IEEB in the areas of impact and explosion effects, research, and experimentation. Much of this research requires the use of heavy construction equipment acquired for use under the current Equipment BPA contract. Off-  road diesel fuel is an ongoing need to fuel this machinery.    <br>   <br> The fuel is needed to fuel equipment at the ERDC High-  Explosive Test Site (EHETS), Fort Polk, Louisiana, and thus cannot be acquired through the ERDC logistics office, which is not authorized to provide fuel for transport. Additionally, the transport of fuel poses safety and liability issues, which can be avoided by using a vendor capable of delivering directly to Fort Polk.  The IEEB has the capacity to store at most 2,000 gallons of diesel at Fort Polk; thus the ability to purchase fuel and have it delivered in increments over a period of time is critical.    <br>   <br> Twenty deliveries of 700 gallons each of off-  road diesel will be required over the contract period.  These deliveries will be scheduled as needed and must be made within 48 hours of notification.  The period of performance should begin around 10 November 2014 and end 31 July 2015.  <br>   <br> The required fuel must be ultra low-  sulfur #2 diesel fuel (dyed for off-  highway use), free of water and debris. The contractor must provide all tools, equipment, materials, transportation and supervision for delivery of the fuel and must hold valid certifications and licenses, as required by the state of Louisiana, for the sale, handling, and transport of off-  road diesel. It is expected that the contractor deliver and unload needed quantity to Fort Polk.    <br>  <br> Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose quote is determined to be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.  FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Offerors must include a completed copy of FAR Provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.  FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The clauses cited within the clause as indicated below are applicable: FAR clauses 52.219-6, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.225-1, 52.223-18, 52.225-3, 52.225-13, and 52.232-33.  Award can only be made to contractors registered in SAM.  Quotes are due 16 November, 2014.  Quotes will only be accepted by email: vendeck.davis@usace.army.mil.  Faxed quotes will not be accepted.  For information concerning this solicitation contact Vendeck Davis at 601-634-4091, or use the above email address.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for Small Businesses under NAICS Code 424710.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-15-Q-010021 is assigned for tracking purposes only.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1. Has a contractor performed similar work to this for the Government in the past? 
If available, please provide the incumbent contract number. 

A1. Yes, Lyttle Utilities, Incorporated has performed similar work for the Government under purchase order VA246-14-P-1304.

Q2. If you are unable to provide a contract number, is it safe to assume this 
is a new requirement for the government? 

A2. See response to Answer 1. 

Q3. Since your wording in your "Request For Quote" email stated "Please note offerors are urged and expected to inspect the site", and since the word "expected" was used, then (Question:) does this constitute and de-facto make this pre-bid meeting to be a Mandatory Pre-Bid Meeting?  And as such, thereby allowing only the attendees to bid on the Snow Removal Services quote VA246-15-Q-0071?   To be transparent here, this same question was asked at the pre-bid meeting this morning and one of the V.A. representatives present, Mr. Mark Harville (for whom I do not have an email address, otherwise I would have copied him on this email), stated that he did not think that the pre-bid meeting was a Mandatory Pre-Bid Meeting.  With all due respect to Mr. Harville, I want to Formally ask this question, and we respectfully await the Government's response.  It is our position that the word "expected" is tantamount to the word "mandatory"; especially and grammatically when used after the word "urged".
A3. The site visit was not mandatory but strongly encouraged. Offerors who did not attend the site visit are still eligible to submit their quote. 
Q4. Also, Mr. Lyttle made mention to me in an email dated 10/16/14 that you and he spoke on the phone earlier that same day, and at that time you mentioned that the Quote may be a SwAM (Small, Woman- and Minority-owned business) set-aside.  However in the same phone conversation you also stated that it had not been determined whether or not it would be so.  Please let us know if the Quote has been determined to be a SwAM set aside or not.
A4. The Contracting Officer stated that market research was still being conducted and no decision had been made on the set aside.  Per paragraph three of the Request for Quote (RFQ), this requirement is being set aside for Small Businesses. Additionally, the SwAM Procurement Initiative is a Virginia program and not applicable to Federal procurements. 
Q5. We understand (from the RFQ) that "Any amendments to this RFQ will ONLY be available on the Federal Business Opportunities website".   Our question is: Will you be sending a courtesy email to the bidders IF any amendments are posted to the FBO website - so that the bidders can be alerted to go there and review?
A5. As a courtesy, the Contracting Officer does notify any offeror that has emailed that an amendment has been posted. However, it is the offeror's responsibility to monitor FBO for any amendments. 
Q6. With regard to the previous attachment labeled "Wage Determination", will certified payrolls be required for this Snow Removal contract?
A6.  Certified payrolls are not required as this is a commercial service. Please reference Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222-41 Service Contract Labor Standards.
Q7. The bid form uses the initials "IAW".   We could not find their meaning in the SOW or in the RFQ.  Please clarify what IAW means for our general information. 
A7. IAW is an acronym for "in accordance with" which is spelled out in Contract Line Item 0001. 
Q8. We see "Pre-Chemical Treatment" on Line 0001 of the "Base Year" bid form, and we understand the references to Section 4.1 of the SOW.  Quoting from SOW 4.1, the "chemical treatment of sidewalks, entryway steps, parking lots and roadways"  and, "provide, maintain, and place Ice Melt, rock salt or any other de-icing product" has historically been taken care of by the McGuire V.A. Medical Center COTR in whatever means or methods have been chosen or implemented by the COTR.   QUESTION:  Is the Government now changing its policy on this issue?   BACKGROUND:  Lyttle Utilities, Inc. has historically provided and stored and maintained and placed only sand on only roadways, parking lots, and/or any other areas as directed by the COTR, and is prepared to continue this service.
We understand from past experience living here in the Richmond area that supplies of Ice Melt, rock salt and other de-icing products can be and typically are in short supply due to the irregularity of multiple-inch snow events and the infrequency of snow events in general.  As such, stores do not stock large quantities and can "sell out" very quickly.  So availability is an issue here.  Also, we presume that a dry, heated storage space would be required in which to store the chemicals so that they do not spoil.  Lyttle Utilities does not have that type of storage space on its yard.  Therefore, since it may be a problem to "provide and maintain" the de-icing products referenced here, then:  QUESTION:  Can Lyttle Utilities use sand in lieu of the de-icing products referenced here?  
A8. Per section 4.1 of the Statement of Work  "The contractor shall provide, maintain, and place Ice Melt, rock salt or any other de-icing product to prevent slipping and falling. The materials used by the Contractor shall not damage the surfaces of sidewalks, entryway steps, parking lots and roadways on the Hunter Holmes McGuire VAMC property". Sand is not a de-icing product and is used to provide additional traction. 
Q9. The McGuire V.A. Medical Center COTR has historically taken care of " removing all snow and ice from sidewalks, steps, landings, and entrance ramps."  by whatever means or methods have been chosen or implemented by the COTR.  QUESTION:  Is the Government now changing its policy on this issue?   BACKGROUND: Lyttle Utilities, Inc. has historically not been involved in this work at the McGuire V.A. Medical Center.  SUBSEQUENT QUESTION:  Is it the Government's intent to have this work performed "by hand" vs. by mechanized equipment?  If the answer is mechanized equipment, then please provide a list of equipment that is "approved for use by the V.A." for the stated sidewalks, steps, landings, and entrance ramps at the McGuire V.A. Medical Center.
A9. Per the Statement of Work,  sidewalks, entryway steps, parking lots and roadways shall be maintained. It is the contractor's discretion as to if this service shall be maintained by hand versus mechanized equipment. Note whatever method chosen, shall not damage any Government property. 
Q10. With reference to SOW 4.3, we are somewhat unclear by some of the wording in 4.3; specifically "when accumulation exceeds one (1) inch or after snowfall stops."   And also, "Snow and ice removal for Priority 1 areas must be accomplished within two (2) hours of initial snowfall.".  We believe there is a conflict between the wording "or after snowfall stops" and the wording "must be accomplished within two (2) hours of initial snowfall".  PLEASE CLARIFY if the Government intends for the word "accomplished" to mean the same as the word "completed".  Our research shows they have the same meaning.  ALSO PLEASE CLARIFY if the Government's use of the wording "initial snowfall" means (in general terms) "the beginning of the snowfall event".  Assuming "accomplished" means the same as "completed" then we are unclear how snow and ice removal can be completed within two (2) hours of "initial snowfall" if we do not begin work until "after snowfall stops".   FOR EXAMPLE:  It starts snowing and we respond to the COTR's request for services in Priority 1 Areas.  It does not stop snowing for, say, 8 hours and roads, parking lots, etc. that were pushed/cleared initially now have to be pushed/cleared again due to the constant snowing.  There is no way Priority 1 Areas can be "accomplished within two (2) hours of initial snowfall".     PLEASE CLARIFY the Government's overall intent and contractor requirements in 4.3.
 A10. The Statement of Work has been changed to state "These areas must always have snow removed in a snow event, and snow in Priority 1 areas shall be removed when accumulation exceeds one (1) inch or when notified by the COR that services are required.   Snow and ice removal for Priority 1 areas must be accomplished within two (2) hours of initial snowfall. Snow and ice removal for Priority 1 areas must be accomplished within two (2) hours of accumulation exceeding one (1) inch or notification of the COR. 

Q11. The same logic and lack of clarity applies to SOW 4.4.  Please clarify.
A11. The Statement of Work has been changed to state "the contractor shall remove snow when accumulation reaches 3 inches. Snow and ice removal for Priority 2 areas must be accomplished within six (6) hours of completion of Priority 1 areas".
Q12. Reference is made to SOW 5.0, RFQ Lines 0001 & 0002 - "Unit Price", and also to our Items 4. and 5., above.  QUESTION:  When does one "Event" stop and another "Event" begin?   PLEASE CLARIFY.   We acknowledge SOW 5.1, 2).  However, should we take this to mean that if we have to return to an area where we previously pushed and cleared snow (for instance, a parking lot), then if we clear it again, does this constitute a new "Event"?
A12 Section 5.0 of the Statement of Work has been changed to "Standby/Repeat Snow Removal Services will be authorized upon written approval by the COR for snowfall or ice accumulation persists after initial services". Additionally, an event is defined as all Priority 1 and 2 areas being cleared. If snowfall persists, the COR would then determine if additional services are required. If required, section 5.0 of the Statement of Work would then apply and the contractor would then invoice under Contract Line Item 0003 for the hours spent on standby or on repeat snow removal. 
Q13. With reference to  Bid Item "Line 003" of the RFQ, we assume the "Rate per hour." Refers only and exclusively to being either called to the site by the COTR to be on standby, but not actually beginning work, and/or "remaining on station for continued service" as stated in SOW 5.1.1.  PLEASE CLARIFY.
A13. Contract Line Item 003 has been changed to 0003. Contract Line Item 0003 applies only to Section 5.0 of the Statement of Work in which the contractor shall be required to remain on site or perform repeat snow removal services. 
Q14. With reference to the RFQ, Bid Item "Line 003", PLEASE CLARIFY the Government's definition of the word "LOT".  Since it is used in the bid item for "Standby/Repeat Snow Removal" and since those are two completely different items, it is unclear what the Government means to convey to the bidder here.  For Instance:  If there is a "Repeat Snow Removal"  then:  QUESTION: why would it not be an "Event" instead of a "Lot"?   We can understand the use of the word "LOT" with regard to a price per hour for being on Standby, but not for Repeat Snow Removal Services.  PLEASE CLARIFY the wording and intent of the wording in Line 003 - in total.
A14. The offeror is required to provide pricing for their rate per hour for work performed under section 5.0 of the Statement of Work. Lot refers to the lot of funds that will allocated at contract award, and the unit price and total unit price will have a not to exceed dollar amount that the contract cannot exceed without prior authorization from the Contracting Officer. Lot in this instance references funding.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC> <br>   The Maneuver, Aviation, and Soldier Division Chief, Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) is seeking sources interested in providing technologies for unmanned ground vehicles for the US Army.  In today's military, unmanned systems are highly desired by Combatant Commanders for their versatility and persistence.  By performing task such as surveillance; signal intelligence; precision target designation; improvised explosive device detection and defeat; tunnel exploration and mapping; mine detection and clearing; and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear reconnaissance, unmanned systems have made key contributions to the Global War on Terror.  With the continued employment of increasingly sophisticated forces of unmanned systems, there will be an ever-increasing demand for new, efficient, innovative and effective technologies.  A better understanding of technologies currently available and/or under development will allow the Army to develop more comprehensive concepts and meaningful requirements.  Responses should include technologies with regards to:    <br>      <br>   1) Communications (antennas, Line of Sight, Non-Line of Sight);    <br>   2) Platforms (emphasis on, but not restricted to, small, lightweight);    <br>   3) Attachments (highly dexterous arms, charge placement, sensors, lights, cameras (color and IR));   <br>   4) Power (batteries, rechargeability);   <br>   5) Mobility;   <br>   6) Countermeasures (both for survivability and offensive use);   <br>   7) Autonomy.   <br>      <br>   Responses to this RFI are not limited to domestic US vendors. Organizations should present their responses in the attached spreadsheet.  Submitters should include as much information as they feel appropriate, however, columns A through Y as especially critical.  Specification sheets and product information may also be provided in addition to the spreadsheet.  Responses to this RFI must be unclassified.  Responses should be submitted no later than 1700 hours on 19 December 2014.  Organizations should submit their responses electronically to LTC Matthew Dooley, Chief, Lethality Branch, ARCIC at matthew.a.dooley3.mil@mail.mil or send hardcopies to LTC Matthew Dooley, Maneuver, Aviation and Soldier Division, Capabilities Directorate, Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC), US Army TRADOC, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, VA 23604-5762.  E-mail file size shall not exceed 5MB.  Technical questions may be directed to Mr. Bruce Donlin at bruce.j.donlin.ctr@mail.mil, or at 703-545-4676.   <br>      <br>   This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Department of Defense in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.    <br>      <br>   Responses are due NLT 1700 EST on 19 December 2014.   <br>

<a href="mailto:shanin.s.johnson.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division B</a>
<DESC>RFI Title: Self - Positioning Technologies for GPS Pseudolites <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTES OR AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES FOR REPONSES. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005, on behalf of the US Army Product Director Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PD-PNT), is conducting a market research to seek information on the state of the art and the ability of industry to support the development and production of position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites.   <br>  <br> Background and Description: <br>  <br> This Request for Information (RFI) by the Army seeks industry feedback on the latest state of the art position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites and the ability of industry to support development and production of position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites.  <br>  <br> GPS Pseudolites are systems that can be deployed terrestrially or near-terrestrially that transmit signals that are similar to GPS Satellite signals. Pseudolite technology has been shown to enable suitably programmed GPS receivers (e.g. software only modifications) to determine their position, velocity and time even under severe electromagnetic interference (jamming). The technology, as demonstrated, has little or no adverse impact on unmodified GPS receivers (military or civilian). The Army plans on deploying pseudolite transmitters on: land vehicles, namely trucks and combat vehicles, and aircraft such as unmanned air vehicles and lighter than air platforms. <br>  <br> The technologies sought should be other than Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Sensor technologies. Examples of technologies to consider are: Celestial, terrain matching, geophysical matching, and signals of opportunity. Technological approaches are not limited to these examples.

OVERVIEW         <br>                  <br>         The U.S. Army Product Manager Soldier Maneuver Sensors (PM SMS) and the Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) are conducting a Sources Sought market survey to identify sources with the interest and capability to provide a Family of Weapons Sight (FWS) Crew Served (CS) system.          <br>                  <br>         The FWS CS goal is to acquire and field a standalone weapon mounted sighting device that meets the requirement of the approved FWS CDD.  The FWS CS will be developed for the M2, MK19 and M240 weapons and will provide day/night capability and will enable a crew served weapon gunner to more accurately engage targets in less time than with currently fielded products. This will be done by utilizing a Helmet Mounted Display and disturbed reticle that adjusts the reticle location based upon range data from an integrated laser range finder or from a Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) Micro-Laser Rangefinder (MLRF).         <br>                  <br>         2.  REQUIREMENTS         <br>                  <br>         The basic technical requirements are divided into categories to enable companies that have solutions in a particular field(s) to provide informational responses on their area of expertise.         <br>                  <br>         2.1.

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Army to identify potential production sources, and if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside.    <br>  The U.S. Army Apache Attack Helicopter Project Office is seeking sources for the Modernized Laser Range Finder Designator (M-LRFD) Lot 4 production.  Four parts that make up an M-LRFD laser kit: M-LRFD, Laser cable assembly (LCA), day sensor electronics unit (DEU) voltage cable (DVC), and DEU assembly. These parts can be installed on new Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot's Night Vision Sensor (M-TADS/PNVS) systems or retrofit existing M-TADS/PNVS Systems.  The M-LRFD laser is integral to M-TADS/PNVS and must interface with existing unmodified equipment as well as provide commands for control of existing sub-systems. Interfaces with other OEM equipment are critical to maintain proper operation of the Apache, particularly because the MTADS/PNVS operates on a flight-stabilized servo gimbal. Extremely small tolerances in mass, balance, electromagnetic interference, optical properties, and many manufacturing techniques must be carefully controlled within the system to ensure performance. The first unit equipped after qualification and first article test must be fieldable in twenty-four months after contract award at the sustained rate of up to twenty-two per month.  <br>    <br>  The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement.

<DESC>11/13/14 Changes: <br> The valuse of the procurement has been increased from $8,250,000 to $10,000,000. The format has also been changed from a base year plus four option years and a 6 month option to extend to a five year contract with a 6 month option to extend. Questions 6. and 7. are as follows.   <br> Q&A <br>  <br> 6.	Please describe the water and sewer systems. Also, please provide any studies completed recently on the two systems. <br> a.	The water and sewer systems are municipal type systems.  The water systems <br> include a water plant, water treatment, wells, reservoirs, distribution <br> piping etc..  The sewer system includes a Waste Water Treatment Plant, <br> gravity sewer lines, forced mains and lift stations etc.. <br>  <br> There have been several studies of these systems over the past few years. <br> We will not release any of the studies or detail information on these <br>  systems until after award and when a task order would be issued that would require this information. <br>  <br> 7.	We have found with many A/E solicitations, that the requirement for Fire Protection Engineer includes either a) a BS or MS in fire protection engineering from an accredited institution, b) PE registration in a related, relevant field or c) NCEES fire protection examination; each with a minimum of five years of experience, with all current nationally-recognized codes, such as National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) [with emphasis in NFPA 101 Life Safety and DOD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC 3-600- 01)], and with at least two years of experience in the design of sprinkler and High Expansion Foam fire protection systems.  Will one of these three means of meeting the Fire Protection Engineer requirement be satisfactory? <br>  <br> a.	Any of these three are acceptable.  <br>  <br> 10/29/14 Changes;  <br>        Q&A  <br>    <br>  3.In reviewing the solicitation noted above, near the end of the  quote mark SUBMISSION FORMAT quote mark  paragraph, we see a requirement that 50% of the labor be performed by personnel of the prime contractor.  We're used to seeing such a requirement on small-business set-aside solicitations, but not on full and open ones.  With the wide variety of work and specialized services under the solicitation, it would be difficult for otherwise-qualified firms which don't offer full services in-house to meet this requirement.

THIS NOTIFICATION SUPERCEDES THE PREVIOUS MARKET RESEARCH POSTED ON OCTOBER 21, 2014. THE INDUSTRY DAY LOCATION HAS BEEN CHANGED TO ROME, ITALY. PLEASE REVIEW THE FOLLOWING FOR LOCATION DETAILS.

Market Research Sources Sought/Request for Information
 Renewable Energy Generation/Production
US Navy
 Italy 

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  THIS SYNOPSIS AND MARKET RESEARCH/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ARE INFORMATIONAL AND FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS WILL NOT BE ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement, and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice.
  This notice is a market research tool used to obtain information only and to identify contractors who possess the capabilities to provide services as described below.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Europe Africa and South West Asia (EURAFSWA) is performing this market research to aid in the development of its acquisition approach.
N62470-14-R-6023: MARKET RESEARCH/ REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR RENEWABLE AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY GENERATION/PRODUCTION TO SUPPLY LOCATIONS IN ITALY.
NAVFAC EURAFSWA is performing research to determine whether a Request for Proposal (RFP) for renewable electric power generation opportunities in off base locations are available to transmit power across the existing local grid to US Naval Station Sigonella and Naval Support Activity Naples (and potentially Air Force bases in Italy).
  NAVFAC EURAFSWA is particularly interested in renewable energy systems that have been newly constructed. Power purchase costs (rates) would need to be within normal market prices for the duration of the contract. NAVFAC EURAFSWA seeks to identify responsible sources and obtain information regarding opportunities and risks associated with renewable energy production.  The results of this Sources Sought/Request for Information (SS/RFI) will assist in developing a potential RFP that may be issued at a later date.
As permitted by FAR Part 10, NAVFAC EURAFSWA is requesting responses, comments, recommendations and suggestions as Market Research and Request for Information to assist in the development of an acquisition strategy.
 The intent is to identify potential proposers and collect information on any conventional or renewable energy generation that is economically attractive and feasible. NAVFAC EURAFSWA desires to solicit maximum industry participation allowing formulation of a concise acquisition process in a timely manner.
This Request for Information shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government. The US Government does not intend to finance any effort associated with this SS/RFI nor guarantee award of a contract on the basis of this RFI.
Synopsis of Relevant Conditions at US Naval Station Sigonella and Naval Support Activity Naples

Naval Support Site Naples has two primary sites in the Naples Italy area.
  The Support Site located in Gricignano and the main site located in Capodichino. The combined load currently averages 6 MW in winter and 10 MW in summer, with a peak load of roughly 12 MW. The highest load occurs in the summer months due to the HVAC demand driven by the warm weather conditions.  Naval Air Station Sigonella is served by the same local utility company as Naples, and is also connected to the local electricity grid.  There are two primary sites NAS 1 and NAS 2 both located in Sigonella Sicily. The combined load currently averages 6 MW in winter and 10 MW in summer, with a peak load of roughly 12 MW. The highest load occurs in the summer months due to the A/C demand driven by the warm weather conditions.
   

Currently, all electrical power is purchased via competitive procurement. Power is distributed across the site via Navy maintained and operated distribution systems. 

The response should address electrical integration with the existing power supply e.g. the varying capacity of the potential renewable plant relative to the purchase of brown power to supply the required load.  
NAVFAC EURAFSWA will not provide land for this project.  The project is required to be newly constructed, any renewable energy credits would be sold exclusively to the Navy. 

The responses should address electrical integration with the existing power supply e.g. the varying capacity of the potential renewable plant relative to the purchase of brown power to supply the required load.

Scope  and  Objectives  Renewable Energy Generation Projects
Specific objectives for subject project include:
	Purchase energy at a lower or equal cost than current/projected market costs.
	Targeted renewable energy generation is up to 25 MW.
	Identify all favorable renewable resources and energy efficient opportunities.
	Reduce Navys carbon footprint.

The North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code for this procurement is 221118- Other Electric Power Generation.

<a href="mailto:Sandra.Oquita@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Los Angeles</a>
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the state of Nevada to include Nellis Air Force Base. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:   <br>    <br>  (a) A Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.   <br>    <br>  (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will   <br>    <br>  (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and   <br>  (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.  <br>    <br>  Please provide responses to any or all of the following questions:  <br>    <br>  (1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar, large scale military construction contracts at Nellis Air Force Base? If yes, describe how a PLA will achieve economy and efficiency in the procurement, produce labor management stability, and/or ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards? If no, describe why?  <br>    <br>  (2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?  <br>    <br>  (3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? How?  <br>    <br>  (4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?  <br>    <br>  (5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?  <br>    <br>  (6) What is the cost impact to the bid/proposal due to a PLA?  <br>    <br>  (7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District contract?  <br>    <br>    <br>  Please limit your responses to no more than two (2) to three (3) pages in length. Please provide your comments via email to Sandra Oquita, Contracting Officer, at sandra.oquita@usace.army.mil not later than 12 December 2014 at 10am PST.  <br>    <br>  Contracting Office Address:  <br>  ATTN: CESPL-CT-E, attn: Sandra Oquita  <br>  915 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1400,   <br>  Los Angeles, CA 90017.   <br>  The email address is: sandra.oquita@usace.army.mil.   <br>    <br>  Place of Performance:  <br>  Davis-Monthan Air Force Base  <br>  Arizona  <br>    <br>  Primary Point of Contact:  <br>  Sandra Oquita  <br>  Contracting Officer  <br>  sandra.oquita@usace.army.mil  <br>  213 452-3249   <br>  Contracting Office Address:   <br>  USACE District, Los Angeles, CA 90053-2325   <br>  Place of Performance:   <br>  USACE District, Los Angeles CA 90053-2325  <br>  US   <br>  Point of Contact(s):   <br>  Sandy Oquita, (213)452-3249  <br>    <br>  USACE District, Los Angeles   <br>  ________________________________________  <br>    <br>    <br>

COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.
