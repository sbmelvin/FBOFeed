<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control intends to award a sole source purchase order to the National Council on Aging (NCOA), 1901 L Street, 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20036.
<p>The authority for this sole source is FAR Part 6.302-1. The NAICS code is 813319, Other Social Advocacy Organizations. The work involved with this project is to develop a National Fall Prevention Guide to aid with capacity building, implementation and sustainability of effective strategies. The specific objective of this program is to produce a comprehensive guide based on CDC's "Preventing Falls: How to develop community-based fall prevention programs for older adults" guide, that describes evidence based fall prevention strategies, capacity building strategies, implementation and evaluation strategies, maintenance of fidelity, policy change strategies, sustainability of evidence based strategies, and resources on how to do the latter.</p>
<p>NCOA is the only responsible source on a national organization level capable of developing the National Prevention Guide utilizing 1) existing formal relationship in place with states through present State Fall Coalitions; 2) existing funded relationship with the Aging on Administration fall prevention programming, a key partner to CDC for the dissemination of evidence based fall prevention programs; 3) national leadership to bring together experts, national and local partners, and federal agencies to develop the Guide; 4) expertise and resources required for a successful completion of the project. It is imperative to purchase services directly from NCOA to ensure successful dissemination of the Guide through the Falls Free Coalitions in the future.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the National Council on Aging. However, firms that believe they can provide these services/supplies are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Officer by December 13, 2011.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Vallerie Redd by email at gfj3@cdc.gov. and reference solicitation # 2012-Q-14272 on subject line.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by CGS under contract number HHSM-500-2010-M0002Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals.<br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>The present solicitation is for the development of an iFAB Foundry which will provide a distributed manufacturing capability that includes the selection of participating manufacturing processes and equipment, the sequencing of the product flow and production steps, the generation of machine instruction sets, and the generation of instructions for human workers. It is anticipated that the iFAB Foundry capability is likely to result from the amalgamation of existing fabrication capabilities from a model library that characterizes the salient attributes of each modality of fabrication: cost, speed, range of applicability, speed of reconfigurability, etc. The resultant iFAB Foundry need not be manifested as a single facility co-resident under one roof; it can be a virtual aggregation of distributed capabilities, sequenced and tied together into a single resultant product flow.

<DESC>DARPA's Adaptive Vehicle Make (AVM) portfolio of programs is aimed at compressing at least five-fold the development timelines for new complex cyber-electro-mechanical systems such as military vehicles. Under AVM, DARPA is pursuing the development of several elements of enabling infrastructure aimed at radically transforming the systems engineering/design/verification (META /META-II), manufacturing (iFAB), and innovation (vehicleforge.mil) elements of the overall "make" process for delivering new defense systems or variants. Each of these infrastructure capabilities is largely generic, i.e., applicable to any cyber-electro-mechanical system. In order to exercise these capabilities at scale and in the context of a relevant military system, the present solicitation is aimed at producing FANG-the Fast, Adaptable, Next-Generation Ground Vehicle-a new heavy, amphibious infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) with functional requirements intended to mirror the Marine Corps' Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV).  The FANG performer will be responsible for staging a series of FANG Challenges, prize-based design competitions for progressively more complex vehicle subsystems, culminating in the design of a full IFV. The FANG Challenges will leverage the META design tools and the vehicleforge.mil collaboration environment to significantly change the design experience and open the aperture for design innovation.
<p>For a detailed description of this opportunity please see the attached file - DARPA-BAA-12-15 FANG.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to award a contract to serve as the "NIDDK Biosample Repository".<br /><br />NIDDK conducts and supports much of the clinical research on the diseases of internal medicine and related subspecialty fields. Many of the large clinical studies funded by the NIDDK collect biospecimens from subjects for analysis and future study. The collection of these patient and control samples from many different studies in a single repository is a valuable resource with which researchers can rapidly validate clinical hypotheses and algorithms for clinical decision. The collection also advances the development of prognostics, markers, and therapeutics for diseases related to the mission of the NIDDK. This project, referred to herein as the "Biosample Repository", continues an important collection begun in 2003 and is conceptually related to repositories in existence at other institutes at the NIH. This repository stores and maintains biosamples under high quality conditions, and distributes them in an equitable and ethical manner. This facilitates the sharing of NIDDK-supported resources, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations without excluding those who are established in their fields. It helps to ensure that research participants make a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.<br /><br />The objective of this requirement is to continue the NIDDK Biosample Repository in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner, to receive and store biosamples collected in many different studies, carry out specified sample processing and analyses, and widely distribute biosamples to qualified investigators.<br /><br />The tasks to be performed under the new requirement include, but are not limited to the following: (a) establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies; (b) maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples; (c) establish one or more subcontracts for timely and cost-effective shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository and for timely and cost-effective laboratory processing and/or testing of biosamples; (d) store biosamples under optimal conditions to minimize loss, damage or contamination; (e) distribute biosamples to qualified investigators granted access by the Project Officer, including packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites; (f) withdraw and destroy samples from the repository as directed in writing by the Project Officer; (g) establish agreements to receive, process, store, and distribute samples from NIDDK-supported studies; (h) establish and maintain Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) programs; (i) provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery; (j) maintain high quality, secure information systems to allow detailed tracking of sample receipt, processing, storage and distribution, rapid retrieval of samples, storage of QA/QC information associated with the sample, and listing of investigators using the repository; and (k) work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, the External Advisory Committee and the Steering Committee.
<p><br />A cost-reimbursement type contract using NAICS code 493120 - Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage, is contemplated. NLM intends to award a five year contract, with a base year plus four option years, beginning on or about June 1, 2012. FAR Part 15 procedures will be used to compete this procurement with full and open competition. The request for proposals is expected to be released on or about December 21, 2011 at the FedBizOpps website.</p>

The below was previously posted under N61340-11-R-0070.
Requirement: 

The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, has a requirement to provide training solutions that satisfy specific Marine Corps V-22 training requirements.

The primary effort includes the procurement of Marine Corps MV-22 Block C Containerized Flight Training Devices (CFTDs) 2F200-9 through 2F200-16; the requirement also includes necessary concurrency upgrades for CFTDs 2F200-9 through 2F200-16, a brief support period following delivery and spares. Pending a review of Fleet USMC training needs, the quantity of devices solicited for may change in the final solicitation

The Marine Corps MV-22 CFTDs are self-contained units, which house a non-motion simulator, a host computer, a visual display system, and an instructor operating station.

CFTDs 2F200-9 through 2F200-16 will simulate MV-22 Block C aircraft operation to the fidelity requirements identified in the system specification.
 CFTDs 2F200-9 through 2F200-16 will be new devices insofar as they are in a new aircraft configuration; however, CFTDs 2F200-9 through 2F200-16 must incorporate the common baseline software that is run on currently-fielded MV-22 CFTDs. 

As a result of market research conducted, to include the sources sought notice for this procurement posted on March 24, 2011, the contracting officer, in coordination with the Small Business Administration, has determined that this procurement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis. This announcement serves to communicate the acquisition strategy and a second pre-solicitation notice will be provided prior to solicitation release.


The Government anticipates a Request for Proposals (RFP) to be released in the 2st Quarter FY12.

The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed Price contract in the 1st Quarter FY13.


The distribution of the solicitation will be accomplished through FedBizOpps and Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO).
 Hard copies of the solicitation documents will not be available. This notice is for informational purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposals. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents is strictly voluntary.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - APG (Belvoir Division) (ACC-APG (Belvoir)) on behalf of the US Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Science and Technology Division, Countermine Technology Branch is conducting market research to gather information on state of the art ground penetrating radar (GPR) technology for potential use in the Army's next generation handheld landmine/explosive hazard detector.  The sensor would be expected to detect targets buried from 0 - 30 cm from distances as far as 7.5 cm above the ground.  It is envisioned that the technology would be attached to an easily portable handheld wand that can be comfortably manipulated with one arm to maneuver and probe underground in search of explosive threats.  All components of the GPR system except a battery power source, which may be shared with other sensors, will be attached to the wand and therefore technologies that are light and easy to carry are desired.  The GPR's antenna footprint (and ultimately survey area) should be no less than 0.06 m2 while being able to resolve small anti-personnel targets (~5 cm diameter).  Sensor head position, including height above ground and attitude, as well as tracking information may be available for integration into signal processing algorithms.  The technology would be expected to provide user feedback in real time.  A display is expected to be available for visual user feedback if appropriate.  Any technology would ultimately have to operate on a non-interfering basis with an identical system operating nearby - minor software adjustments would be allowed to ensure interoperability.  The Army will primarily be considering tradeoffs between radar technology capability, antenna footprint/survey area, user information provided and size/weight.  Proprietary information submitted in response to this Sources Sought shall be marked accordingly and will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary. Offerors are responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses and/or acquiring test data.  Submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items/services, or for the government to pay for the information received. No solicitation document exists.  Submit white papers electronically to Mr. Paul Easton, Contract Specialist at paul.a.easton.civ@mail.mil. All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephonic requests for additional information will not be honored.<br><br>Keywords:  ground penetrating radar,  GPR, handheld, detector <br>

BEP is seeking a system that can measure color and print density rapidly and accurately on a moving sheet of paper.<br />BEP is requesting information from vendors who can provide a system that can meet the following requirements:<br />&bull; Spectral measurement, using 20nm wavelength intervals or smaller<br />&bull; Capable of self-triggering and external triggering (for example, encoder based) to make measurement; also capable of identifying color patches for measurement<br />&bull; Full set of color and print density measurements at a rate of at least 2 per millisecond, to accommodate a fast moving sheet.<br />&bull; Should provide an electrical output(s) when measurement(s) outside programmed specifications are encountered.<br />&bull; Should be a contactless measurement - preferably several millimeters away from the sheet.<br />&bull; Sampling (measurement) spot should be as small as possible, preferably less than 5mm. <br />&bull; Should accommodate any inherent sheet waviness, and also sheet flutter during movement that may result in vertical displacement of the sheet towards or away from measurement system, or slight angular changes.<br />&bull; Should withstand factory conditions such as vibrations, dust, and ambient light changes.<br />Specific information related to the above would also include the accuracy, repeatability and range of the measurements. A plot (or data) illustrating the variation in measurement with distance/angle from the target would be useful. The color spaces, density standards (along with associated details) supported should be listed. <br />Any other information that the interested party may wish to provide about the hardware and functionality of the measurement system such as measurement scheme, geometry, parameters (spot size, measurement time, processing time), instrument size, electrical requirements, interfaces, etc. is welcome. BEP also seeks additional information/examples related to the graphical display and storage of the measurements - specifically the format, content, and statistical computations, if any.<br />The Vendor will provide their lead time for delivery and an initial estimated cost. A copy of the vendor's brochures and technical information on their systems is requested in PDF format. <br />Interested parties are requested to submit responses via email only to:<br />Donna Fudge<br />Contract Specialist<br />donna.fudge@BEP.GOV<br />(202) 927-9576</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is seeking sources to establish several Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with vendors, who are classified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as HUBZone (HUB), based upon 13 CFR Part 126; Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), based upon 13 CFR Part 127, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOB), also known as Service Disabled Veterans, based upon 13 CFR Part 125.8 and Part 125.13. The BEP anticipates establishing BPAs that are set-aside for each of these categories. The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to increase the BEP&rsquo;s listing of vendors who are capable of supplying required stock items. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">The establishment of these BPAs within these specific business classification categories will assist the BEP in achieving its small business participation goals and thereby assist in the creation of set-asides for each of these categories. Therefore, small businesses, which do not possess these additional classifications, or large businesses, will not be permitted to participate in this opportunity. These additional classifications must be visible on an <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Active</em> Central Contractor Registration (CCR) profile.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">The resulting contract vehicles will be utilized by the BEP Office of Acquisition &ndash; Purchasing and Inventory Division, for the acquisition of stock items for its plants located in Washington, DC and Ft. Worth, TX. Vendors will be required to possess the above referenced classification certifications at the time of expressing interest in establishing a BPA, during creation of the contract vehicle, as well as maintain the classification at the time calls are placed against the agreement. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">The BPAs will be issued based upon the most frequently purchased product categories. These categories are customarily associated with the following NAICS codes:</span></p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) notice only. This&nbsp;RFI is for informational planning purposes only and it not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of materials, machinery, or services. This notice does not constitute a solicitation or a promise of a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI are solely at the responding parties' expense. Respondents are solely responsible for properly marking and clearly identifying any proprietary information or trade secrets contained within their response. The Government will not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly marked and clearly identified. Proprietary information received in response to this sources sought will be safeguarded and handled in accordance with applicable Government regulations. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The BEP will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued. <br /><br />The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) offers free tours to the public at its Eastern Currency Facility (ECF) in Washington, DC and at its Western Currency Facility (WCF) in Fort Worth, Texas. BEP is seeking information from responsible sources that are capable of providing an on-line hosted reservation ticketing system. This capability shall be available as a Software as a Service (SAAS), meaning that it is 100% hosted by the vendor. BEP is primarily interested in services that currently exist.<br /><br />The basic and ideal concept of operation is that BEP will enter into a no-cost contract with the vendor to brand and operate this as a service for BEP. The public will be directed to the vendor site to obtain tickets. It is desired that a nominal fee be charged per ticket, i.e. &lt;$2/ticket. This nominal charge via a credit or debit card per ticket is to ensure that a single user does not maliciously consume otherwise free tickets and fail to use them appropriately which would prevent persons who desire a tour from obtaining tickets they want. This fee is to be paid directly to and retained by the vendor. It is desired that this fee recovery by the vendor would fully cover the vendor costs to operate the site. <br /><br />For estimation purposes only, the following are tour hours of operation and estimated demand for tickets that could be processed at the ECF and WCF.<br /><br />Eastern Facility Tour Hours: <br />ECF tours run every 15 minutes and can accommodate a maximum of 50 people per tour group. ECF offers tour tickets to the public March through August. September to April are walk-up tours and no reservation is required and no tickets to the public will be offered however, internal BEP management of tours is required through the system.<br />During the month of March, tours for the general public run from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. with advanced reservations held for congressional offices and large groups at 8:15 a.m., 8:45 a.m., and 11:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. <br />In March, the maximum number of visitors per day is 1,200. Of this amount, approximately 450 spots are reserved for congressional offices and school groups, leaving a balance of 750 slots for tickets, a percentage of which must be available for walk ups. <br />March: approximately 500 ECF daily tickets would be available online<br /><br />ECF Extended Tour Hours<br />At the ECF, extended tour hours are offered to the general public April through August, from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., with the following tour times reserved for congressional offices and large groups: 8:15 a.m., 8:45 a.m., 11:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 4:45 p.m. <br /><br />The maximum number of visitors per day - April through August - is 2,200. Of this amount, approximately 650 spots are reserved for congressional offices and school groups, leaving a balance of 1,550 slots for general public tickets, a percentage of which must be available at the ticket booth for walkup visitors.<br /><br />April through August: approximately ECF 1,000 daily tickets would be available online<br /><br />Western Currency Facility Tour Hours:<br />WCF tours have a maximum of 75 people per tour group. WCF tours run every 30 minutes, on the hour and half hour. <br />During the months of August through May, the tour is open Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. <br />August through May: 500 WCF daily tickets would be available online<br /><br />WCF Extended Tour Hours:<br />At the WCF, extended tour hours are offered to the public during the months of June and July only, Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. <br />June and July: 1,000 WCF daily tickets would be available online<br />High level attributes of the desired ticketing system are:<br />&bull; Website hosted reservation system.<br />&bull; Capable of managing 2 separate tour operations, ECF and WCF.<br />&bull; Capable of permitting BEP to control the number of reservations available for certain days, times of day per location and days or months in advance. <br />&bull; Capable of utilizing software to track all categories of tickets whether made available on line or not, i.e. school groups, VIP tours, etc.<br />&bull; Providing metric reports and real time status of tickets reserved and remaining available.<br />&bull; Tickets and confirmation information can be provided as on line downloads printable by the user; provided to a mobile device, or picked-up at Will Call by the requestor. <br />&bull; Providing internal protections to prevent a person from consuming more than a BEP specified allotment of tickets per unit time.<br /><br />Please limit your response to a total of 10 pages.

<DESC>To promote early exchange of information with industry in accordance with FAR 15.2, Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Systems (NAVAIR-PMA202) of Patuxent River, Maryland is issuing this Request for Information (RFI). NAVAIR is requesting information from industry to identify potential candidates to fill a possible future need for improved flight deck hearing protection.<br /><br />US Navy aviation personnel work up to 16 hours a day in close proximity to 130-150 dB jet engine noise. DoDI 6055.12 hearing conservation policy states that personnel noise exposure should not exceed an average of 85 dBA during an 8-hour workday. Today's earmuff is nearly the same as 50 years ago. Worn with expanding foam or sized earplugs, this double hearing protection configuration at best provides about 30 dB of hearing protection. Crews working in the military jet noise environments are often overexposed on a daily basis. Some closest to launching jets are overexposed in one launch but may be required to support up to 60 launches per day. Hearing loss, coupled with communications systems that allow undesirable noise to mask desired speech and alarm signals, places all in jeopardy working in this high stakes operational environment. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is seeking vendor products that can provide acceptable hearing protection and communication systems for individuals working in these environments. <br /><br />Submitted products shall increase the Warfighter's effectiveness and survivability by enhancing and protecting communication and hearing in a 130-150 dB noise prevalent military jet aircraft operations environment. The product may consist of a suite of passive and ANR communication earplug and headset technologies that can be tailored to mission need. Products that have been certified to be safe, supportable, and a significant improvement over current hearing protection/communication systems are desired. <br /><br />Submitted products must reduce noise by a minimum of 40 dB. It is desired that submissions also meet as many of the additional attribute requirements identified below.
<p>The material shall not present a health hazard (non-toxic) and shall show compatibility with prolonged, direct skin contact. Chemicals recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as human carcinogens shall not be used. Products in the Naval Aviation Environment must meet applicable sections of MIL-STD-461 and MIL-STD-464. Compliance can be demonstrated with historical data.</p>
<p>End item wear and comfort: The material shall have a comfortable feel and be non-irritating to the skin of the flight deck personnel; it shall not cause distraction to flight deck personnel resulting from irritation. The product shall resist staining from contact with common molds and fungus, petroleum, oils, and lubricant products, tars, and surfactants. The product shall require minimum care and maintenance and shall maintain its protective properties through its service life. The product shall provide a minimum service life of 5 years of flight deck use.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334 Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing/ 3342 Communications Equipment Manufacturing<br /><br />In addition, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2533a, vendors must certify their product is Berry Amendment compliant - manufacturers must list the origin and place of manufacturing operations of all components.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are invited to describe their capabilities to provide the product as described herein. Product information shall be submitted at no expense to the Government and will not be returned. All submissions will receive email confirmation of arrival but only down selected materials will receive further results and communication from NAVAIR. Proprietary data MUST be marked on a page-by-page basis, and will be kept confidential and protected in accordance with the Uniform Trades Secret Act. Interested sources shall state whether their product is available commercially.</p>
<p>Companies responding to this request for information should send all responses and questions via email to: greg.szczyglowski@navy.mil</p>
<p>Interested companies should indicate whether or not they are a small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), or large business. All respondents shall include all of the information listed below and limit their responses to no more than 10 pages. 1) Company name and Solicitation number in the email subject line. 2) Company address, telephone number, primary contact(s) with e-mail address(es), NAICS code(s), business size (i.e., small/large/HUB Zone), CAGE code, and DUNS number. (Respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to obtain a DUNS number. Firms may register with CCR at http://www.ccr.gov.) 3) Statement of capability demonstrating background, experience, skills, ability and availability to fulfill the Government's requirements described herein, to include recommended improvements. This can also include current or past performance of providing this or similar products to the Government. 4) Estimated cost, typical delivery schedule, and anticipated volume discounts. 5) If applicable, a description of currently available commercial products, as well as the ability to modify existing products or develop new products that could meet the requirements described herein. Samples shall be sent to DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR WARFARE CENTER,ATTN: SAM YOUNG, CODE 1.3.1, 47123 BUSE ROAD, BLDG 2272, SUITE 347, PATUXENT RIVER, MD 20670-1127.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE.  The USGS has a requirement for conducting helicopter aeromagnetic survey in California to provide digitally recorded and processed aeromagnetic data.   The contractor shall propose how they would design the survey altitude, survey operations, pre-flight planning (such as a preplanned flight surface), and data processing procedures to ultimately obtain gridded data observed on a surface 100 meters above terrain that is of the highest resolution and quality (minimal filtering and least amount of fight line noise).  The objective is to map NW oriented faults and geologic structures in the Long Valley Caldera and Mono Lake areas.  Total field aeromagnetic survey shall be flown along traverse lines oriented generally ENE-WSW (~65 degrees east of North) at 400 meters (0.24 mile) line spacing with a magnetometer ground clearance of 150 meters (500 feet) depending on mutual agreement on the survey design and processing procedures.  Control lines shall be flown generally perpendicular to the traverse lines at 4.0 kilometer (2.4 mile) spacing.  Optional line miles, if awarded, will be primarily located to the northeast, adjoining the Long Valley Caldera and Mono Lake areas.  Data is required OVER POPULATED AREAS (congested areas in FAA terminology). The contractor shall propose how they shall obtain data OVER POPULATED AREAS especially the ski resort town of Mammoth Lakes. There may also be time and/or altitude restrictions over Mono Lake for gull nesting between April 1 and August 1, and possibly until September 1.    An example of recently flown data shall be submitted with each contractors quotation.  The USGS is in search of small business firms who are able to perform the above mentioned services.  Small business firms who feel they can furnish the required services or its functional equivalent (based on criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required services state herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exists.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the name and telephone number for a point of contact) to the contract specialist listed in the announcement within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Kansas Water Science Center, requires rapid analysis of geosmin and MIB in water samples. Historically comparable data is imperative. Use of alternate vendors may lead to issues regarding data quality, continuity, comparability and interpretability. Consequences include compromised data sets, inability to publish data, inability to identify or interpret trends in long-term data sets, and timeliness of reports. The Government anticipates a purchase order for a base year and 4 option years, from approximately December 20, 2011 through December 19, 2016.
Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from Engineering Performance Solutions, LLC, and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and other such materials which correspond to the required services and supplies stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business December 20, 2011 by 3:00 P.M. Mountain Standard Time.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source - Stemnion Inc.
<SOLNBR>N6264512WM001
<ARCHDATE>12262011
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil">NMLC Research Division</a>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 6.302-1 to Stemnion, Inc., 100 Technology Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, for the performance of continued research and development efforts in support of the Naval Medical Research Center’s cellular combat wound initiative.  

The contract award builds upon Stemnion’s successful completion of pre-clinical animal trials and the appropriate pre-clinical animal safety testing.  The latter included multiple toxicology studies that resulted in FDA permission to proceed with a 2009 Phase I human clinical trial using ACCS to demonstrate safety in the treatment of partial thickness burns.  The Phase I human trial outcomes demonstrated safety in the treatment regimen and allowed Stemnion to proceed to the next round of clinical trials.
  Those efforts include: 

•	Preparation and Development of Materials for Research and Clinical Trials 
•	ACCS Research & Development: formulations for controlled-release, release to specific tissues and to stabilize the ACCS for storage at room temperature.
•	Immunology
•	Ocular Surface Disorder/Dry Eye Clinical Trial

The estimated value of this contract is $8.347 Million. The period of performance for this contract is anticipated to be a base period of 18-months.  Stemnion controls over 20 patents pending that are directly related to the AMP cell and ACCS cytokine solution therapies that are entering FDA Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. Stemnion is positioning itself to have a first-in-class, FDA-approved product for use in wound healing and, eventually, other clinical applications as well.

Although other companies will be able to produce their own products based on their own proprietary technology and cells, it will be very difficult for a company to develop a generic (me-too) version of Stemnion’s product for several reasons.

The first is that Stemnion’s products are very complex biologicals which would be hard to replicate.
 Secondly, Stemnion’s confidential, proprietary process would be difficult if not impossible to copy. Thirdly, the Affordable Care Act provides for 12 years of data exclusivity for new biologics such as Stemnion’s products. Therefore, once Stemnion’s product is FDA-approved, even if a company were able to make a same or similar product (termed a “biosimilar”) it would still have to wait 12 years before being allowed to rely on data generated by Stemnion to obtain FDA approval. This would force a company interested in producing a biosimilar to commit millions of dollars and years of research to generate their own preclinical and clinical data.

Based on these unique capabilities and the previous work done with Stemnion.
  Stemnion is the only company capable of meeting the Government’s requirements.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data and other information sufficient to determine capability to perform the proposed contract effort.

All capability statements received by 3:30PM Eastern Time on December 20, 2011, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
  Capability statements shall be submitted by email ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source. The Department of Treasury's Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Morningstar, Inc, 22 W Washington St, Chicago, IL 60602-1605 for a subscription to Morningstar Direct. An award will be issued for a base year, and one option period.
<p><br />The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act established the OFR within the Treasury Department to improve the quality of financial data available to policymakers and facilitate more robust and sophisticated analysis of the financial system.</p>
<p>Morningstar Direct is a web-based institutional platform that will provide the OFR access to Morningstar's global databases and investment research.</p>
<p>A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Morningstar Inc. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by December 13, 2011 at 2:00pm ET. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, Attention TW/LS</p>

<CONTACT>Maria L Mendoza, Phone (206)526-6671, Email Maria.L.Mendoza@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Services located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Marine Operations. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed contract is for research study of Xenoestrogens on Puget Sound Fish. The following tasks are required for this work: 1.) Conduct waterborne exposure of fathead minnows and 1+ age coho salmon to ethynylestradiol (EE2) -The sensitivity of fathead minnows and coho salmon parr to EE2 will be assessed by exposing fish to tank water containing 1 or 10 ng/L for 2 to 7 days and monitoring production of vitellogenin by the liver. Exposures to two concentrations of EE2 and control water must be done in duplicate for each species. Contractor will maintain fish prior to and during the experiments, conduct all exposures and assist NOAA with collection of blood and tissue samples after the exposure. Contractor will conduct chemical analyses to determine levels of EE2 in tank water during the exposure. 2.)Conduct exposure of 1+ age coho salmon to water containing effluent from sewage waste-water treatment (SWWT) facilities in the Puget Sound region. Fish will be exposed to effluent from six different SWWT facilities for 2-7 days. Effluent will be brought to the contractor's facilities and contractor must store water on sight in refrigerated conditions prior to the study. Contractor will maintain fish prior to and during the experiments, conduct all exposures and assist NOAA with collection of blood and tissue samples after the exposure.
<p>Dr. Dr. Irvin R. Schultz at Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Marine Operations, Sequim, Washington is uniquely qualified to conduct this work to assist NOAA in development of endocrine disruptor bioassays in salmon for the following reasons:<br />1) Dr. Schultz previously performed similar waterborne exposures of juvenile coho salmon to endocrine disrupting chemicals as part of joint research with scientists at NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center. NOAA used results from this previous work to design the project to compare responsiveness of salmon and fathead minnows.<br />Therefore, continuity with previous research is required. <br />2) Dr. Schultz has knowledge on the kinetics of the response of fathead minnows and salmonid fishes to ethynylestradiol, which is needed for determining the duration of exposures. <br />3) Dr. Schulz has all of the needed facilities to conduct this work and is located within the Puget Sound area. This work requires that facilities be in close proximity to Puget Sound to reduce costs of transporting large volumes of water from sewage treatment plants in the Puget Sound area to the laboratory facilities. Dr. Schulz's laboratory facilities are in Sequim, Washington on the shores of Puget Sound. The wet lab facilities at Battelle PNNL in Sequim also have a state of the art effluent treatment process.<br />4) Dr. Schultz has a unique combination of expertise to conduct the studies. He has worked in the field of toxicology for more than 20 years and specifically on effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals in fish for more than 12 years. He has conducted waterborne exposure studies on endocrine disrupting chemicals in a variety of fish species including Rainbow trout, Coho salmon and fathead minnows. He has the analytical capabilities to determine both water and plasma levels of ethynylestradiol, which are required to control exposure levels for this work. He has all of the necessary facilities to conduct the work,<br />including storage facilities for the large volumes of effluent from sewage waste-water treatment facilities. <br />The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with performance period of nine months from date of award. The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $7.0M. It is the Government's belief that only Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory can complete this project. This notice represents the only official notice.

The Government anticipates that IDIQ Delivery Orders will be issued during the contract period as the need arises for Dyess AFB, TX, project designs. For each of the two contracts, cumulative amounts of all delivery orders on each contract, separately, will not exceed $995,000.00 each.</p>
<p>6. Design Within Funding Limitations <br />(a) The A-E shall accomplish design services required under this contract so as to permit the award of contracts using standard Federal Acquisition Regulation procedures for the construction of projects designed at a price that does not exceed the estimated construction contract price established for each Delivery Order issued under this contract. When bids or proposals for the construction contract are received that exceed the estimated price, the A-E shall perform such redesign and other services as are necessary to permit contract award within the funding limitation. These additional services shall be performed at no increase in the Delivery Order price. However, the A-E shall not be required to perform such additional services at no cost to the Government if the unfavorable bids or proposals are the result of conditions beyond its reasonable control. <br />(b) The A-E will promptly advise the Contracting Officer if it finds that the project being designed will exceed or is likely to exceed the funding limitations and it is unable to design a usable project within these limitations. Upon receipt of such information, the Contracting Officer will review the A-E's revised estimate of construction cost. The Government may, if it determines that the estimated construction contract price set forth in this contract is so low that award of a construction contract not in excess of such estimate is improbable, authorize a change in scope or materials as required to reduce the estimated construction cost to an amount within the estimated construction contract price, or the Government may adjust such estimated construction contract price. When bids or proposals are not solicited or are unreasonably delayed, the Government shall prepare an estimate of constructing the design submitted and such estimate shall be used in lieu of bids or proposals to determine compliance with the funding limitation.</p>
<p>7. Responsibility of the Architect-Engineer Contractor<br />(a) The A-E shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the Contractor under this contract. The A-E shall, without additional compensation, correct or revise any errors or deficiencies in its designs, drawings, specifications, and other services. <br />(b) Neither the Government's review, approval or acceptance of, nor payment for, the services required under this contract shall be construed to operate as a waiver of any rights under this contract or of any cause of action arising out of the performance of this contract, and the A-E shall be and remain liable to the Government in accordance with applicable law for all damages to the Government caused by the A-E's negligent performance of any of the services furnished under this contract. <br />(c) The rights and remedies of the Government provided for under this contract are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law. <br />(d) If the A-E is comprised of more than one legal entity, each such entity shall be jointly and severally liable hereunder.</p>
<p>8. Work Oversight in Architect-Engineer Contracts<br />The extent and character of the work to be done by the A-E shall be subject to the general oversight, supervision, direction, control, and approval of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>9.

The Government anticipates that IDIQ Delivery Orders will be issued during the contract period as the need arises for Dyess AFB, TX, project designs. For each of the two contracts, cumulative amounts of all delivery orders on each contract, separately, will not exceed $995,000.00 each.</p>
<p>6. Design Within Funding Limitations <br />(a) The A-E shall accomplish design services required under this contract so as to permit the award of contracts using standard Federal Acquisition Regulation procedures for the construction of projects designed at a price that does not exceed the estimated construction contract price established for each Delivery Order issued under this contract. When bids or proposals for the construction contract are received that exceed the estimated price, the A-E shall perform such redesign and other services as are necessary to permit contract award within the funding limitation. These additional services shall be performed at no increase in the Delivery Order price. However, the A-E shall not be required to perform such additional services at no cost to the Government if the unfavorable bids or proposals are the result of conditions beyond its reasonable control. <br />(b) The A-E will promptly advise the Contracting Officer if it finds that the project being designed will exceed or is likely to exceed the funding limitations and it is unable to design a usable project within these limitations. Upon receipt of such information, the Contracting Officer will review the A-E's revised estimate of construction cost. The Government may, if it determines that the estimated construction contract price set forth in this contract is so low that award of a construction contract not in excess of such estimate is improbable, authorize a change in scope or materials as required to reduce the estimated construction cost to an amount within the estimated construction contract price, or the Government may adjust such estimated construction contract price. When bids or proposals are not solicited or are unreasonably delayed, the Government shall prepare an estimate of constructing the design submitted and such estimate shall be used in lieu of bids or proposals to determine compliance with the funding limitation.</p>
<p>7. Responsibility of the Architect-Engineer Contractor<br />(a) The A-E shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the Contractor under this contract. The A-E shall, without additional compensation, correct or revise any errors or deficiencies in its designs, drawings, specifications, and other services. <br />(b) Neither the Government's review, approval or acceptance of, nor payment for, the services required under this contract shall be construed to operate as a waiver of any rights under this contract or of any cause of action arising out of the performance of this contract, and the A-E shall be and remain liable to the Government in accordance with applicable law for all damages to the Government caused by the A-E's negligent performance of any of the services furnished under this contract. <br />(c) The rights and remedies of the Government provided for under this contract are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law. <br />(d) If the A-E is comprised of more than one legal entity, each such entity shall be jointly and severally liable hereunder.</p>

<DESC>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain an A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.<br /><br />The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, as well as CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program has complex legal, policy, and operating environments. The Contractor will utilize and interact with all pertinent CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will not only coordinate its activities with CMS, but must also work with a broad range of Federal, State, and Local government agencies, CMS partners and Contractors, and any other stakeholder in the health care system of the United States.<br /><br />In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction, and will perform all standard or otherwise required editing with respect to these claims to determine whether they are complete and ready for payment. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."<br /><br />In addition, the Contractor will calculate Medicare payment amounts and remit those payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will conduct redeterminations with respect to appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) which will educate providers with respect to the Medicare program; will respond to provider telephone and written inquiries; will respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and will make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of provider services, such as enrollment of new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers with respect to Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.<br /><br />The Jurisdiction E Solicitation is now released. Please find all the pertinent files regarding this release (the SF-33, RFP Sections B-M, and a Zip file containing all Section J Attachments) attached to this FBO.gov posting.

<ARCHDATE>01122012
<CONTACT>David Stemple, Phone 2699615372, Email david.stemple@dla.mil
<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency has a requirement for Faxination software upgrade and a new 8-port fax board. This is issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) # SP4707-12-Q-0011. Place of performance is Battle Creek, Michigan. Inspection, acceptance and F.O.B. are at destination, Battle Creek, Michigan. Delivery shall be no later than 30 calendar days after award date.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2005-53.</p>
<p>This acquisition is set-aside 100% for small business concerns, and the associated NAICS code is 334210 with a SBA size standard of 1000 in employment.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote. Quotes with quantities different than requested or products other than those specifically requested will be deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>CLIN Descriptions:</p>
<p>CLIN 001: Additional fax lines for Faxination server (4 lines), P/N: FS2010-4FL, QTY: 01 EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 002: Dialogic TR1034+E8-8L 8-channel analog loop-start PCI express fax board, P/N: 901-007-12, QTY: EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 003: Dialogic Advanced Replacement, software maintenance, configuration &amp; deployment support, P/N: 901-007-12-1S, QTY: 01 EA.</p>
<p>Only new equipment is being solicited. Remanufactured or refurbished equipment, as defined in FAR 11.001, is technically unacceptable. Trade-in or exchange of old equipment is not available.</p>
<p>Redacted Brand Name Justification: The Faxination server processes all fax workloads to the Customer Interaction Center (CIC). To maintain and continue program operation the Microsoft Exchange Faxination server must be upgraded in conjunction with the Windows upgrade. The required server upgrade will entail upgrading the current Faxination software and installing a new fax board. An 8-port fax board is estimated to be required to meet the expected increase in fax volumes. Market research and prior purchase history indicate that the Faxination software is only available directly from the software manufacturer and their approved partners and distribution networks.</p>
<p>The evaluation factor(s) for award is; lowest-price, technically acceptable. Any resulting contract or order will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>Please place "SP4707-12-Q-0011" in the subject field of any e-mail correspondence. Questions regarding this RFQ are due by December 8, 2011 at 4:00 p.m. EST. Late questions shall not get answered.

<DESC>Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) is marketing its capabilities as a potential subcontractor for both federal and commercial work (otherwise done outside the United States). FPI is interested in entering into agreements with federal agencies and/or commercial businesses for contact center services, using federal facilities and federal inmate labor. FPI will consider all reasonable proposals that support FPI's mission. The exact agreement that constitutes each arrangement will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF FPI: FPI, which operates under the trade name UNICOR, is a wholly-owned government corporation within the Department of Justice, under the Federal Prison System. The corporation was created by Congress in 1934, and provides employment, education, and training opportunities to inmates under federal custody. FPI operates more than 80 factories at approximately 70 locations. FPI's product lines and service operations are extensive, producing products and services in over 80 different Federal Supply Classes for sale to Federal agencies and the Department of Defense. FPI's mission is to employ and provide skills training to the greatest practicable number of inmates in federal correctional facilities necessary to ensure the safe and secure operation of such institutions and, in doing so, to produce market priced, quality goods and services, in a self-sustaining manner that minimizes potential impact on private business and labor.</p>
<p>CONTACT CENTER OPERATION AND CAPABILITIES: FPI contact center operations perform inbound and outbound B2B services. FPI's outbound B2B centers have performed data scrubbing, lead generation and profiling for some of the top companies in America. The benefits to using FPI contact centers are that FPI has skilled agents, low labor rates, native English and Spanish, high security, and nation-wide coverage. Another benefit is that FPI can provide additional capacity for commercial businesses seeking to grow their business or needing the additional capacity to take on increased customer demand.<br /><br />BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM: FPI currently has business agreements with private sector firms to provide services to the Federal Government, as well as services to the private sector in cases where the services would otherwise be performed outside of the U.S. For some business agreements, FPI provides fully equipped and staffed factories and provides services as turn-key operations for its private sector customers. For other agreements, FPI provides inmate labor and the physical factory space for contact center operations.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: FPI reserves the right to accept or reject proposals received. This notice fulfills FAR Part 5 publication requirements for individual proposals received and meets CICA requirements. Therefore, the intent is to enter into negotiations and/or to contract for services in response to this announcement, and a subsequent notice may not be published on FedBizOpps. Any materials or supply items that FPI procures for its use under the arrangement will be on a competitive basis. <br /><br />Submit proposals to: Clara Roberts, Contract Specialist, Services Business Group, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., Federal Prison Industries<br />501 Capital Circle N.E.Tallahassee, FL 32301<br />850-558-4033 <br />For additional information, contact Kimberly Armfield @ 202-616-2437 or karmfield@central.unicor.gov</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

<p>(viii) 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999). - This is a commercial item acquisition. The evaluation and award procedures in FAR 13.106 apply. <br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical, including personnel qualifications and understanding of and ability to perform the Statement of Work requirements;<br />Past Performance; and,<br />Price.</p>
<p>Within the non-price factors, Technical is more important than Past Performance. Non-price factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>The Government will award BPAs to the offerors whose offers, conforming to the solicitation, are found to offer the best value to the government as a result of the evaluation of non-price factors and the tradeoff analysis of all factors. The Government, therefore, reserves the right to award to other than lowest bidder.</p>
<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. Offerors must meet the following factors at a minimum:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will consider the quality of the following submitted information:</p>
<p>1. Documentation that Offeror shall have at least five (5) years of relevant and recent experience moving dead ship (no power) in confined waterways.</p>
<p>2. Documentation that Offeror shall have at least five (5) years relevant and recent experience moving dead ships (no power) into and out of dry-docks.</p>

<p>PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will consider the quality of the past performance information she obtains from contacting the previous customers of each vendor in assessing its relevance to the requirements of the Statement of Work and, if found to be relevant, in assessing the vendor's ability to successfully perform those requirements as demonstrated by successful past performance. The Contracting Officer will assess the risk of performance for each vendor based on the demonstrated past performance. Vendors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to consider past performance information from any source including Government databases and close at hand information.</p>
<p>PRICE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will evaluate the pricing information submitted for price reasonableness of each CLIN individually and aggregate the total of all the CLINs for all of the ordering periods to arrive at a total price which will be used for comparison in the tradeoff analysis.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

<DESC><p>5 DECEMBER 2011<br />There were a couple of questions asked regarding the solicitation posted. The engineer has provided her answers and they are posted along with the question below.</p>
<p>Question</p>
<p>The solicitation is for two extended area low temperature<br />blackbodies. However, the solicitation specifies only one refrigerated circulation bath (which we refer to as "chiller"). Does that mean that the two blackbodies will be operated at same or similar temperatures?<br />Generally, if they need to be temperature cycled independently, we may need two chillers.</p>
<p>Response</p>
<p>We plan to operate one blackbody at a time, so we would be using ablackbody, the chiller, and the enclosure. The enclosure will be purged with nitrogen to prevent water vapor from condensing or freezing on the emitting<br />surface. The second blackbody is a spare.</p>
<p><br />Question</p>
<p>Item 3.2.1 talks about the openings on two sides of the enclosure (I assume that the two blackbodies are facing in opposite directions inside the enclosure). The opening for the infrared thermometer must be capable of<br />being closed/sealed in between measurements. How big does that opening need to be? Does it need to be closed in some sort of an automated manner? Or manually?</p>
<p>Response</p>
<p>One opening of the enclosure needs to fit over the emitting surface of the blackbody. The second opening is opposite of the first opening so we can measure the emitting surface with an infrared thermometer or infrared<br />camera. We plan on measuring IRTs with a distance to spot size of 20:1 or better so a four inch opening should be sufficient. The second opening may be closed manually or automatically.</p>
<p><br />Question</p>
<p>In section 4.1.4 on Physical dimensions, are the weight and size requirements for the whole enclosure with two blackbodies inside it?</p>
<p>Response</p>
<p>Each blackbody must not exceed 80 pounds. The chiller must not exceed 120 pounds. We do not intend to operate the chiller inside the enclosure.</p>

The Government will not be charged for mission changes.<BR><BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the Online Representatives and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov<BR><BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PRICE. FACTOR #2: SCHEDULE. FACTOR 3: QUALITY OF PRODUCT.<BR><BR>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.</p>

<DESC>** <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Amendment 01 includes one additional question to the interested parties section of the RFI description.&nbsp; All other information&nbsp;to this Sources Sought Notice originally posted 1 Dec 2011 remains unchanged.</span> **<br /><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION. The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. Previous 4P A-E contracts have used NAICS code 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees. We anticipate awarding approximately 10-20 contracts to large and small businesses. We are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for CONUS (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region in addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other) will be similar for all contracts. However the TYPE of projects/programs (i.e. MILCON, MFH, SRM) is anticipated to differ between the worldwide and regional IDIQ suites.</p>
<p>We anticipate the development of two separate Statements of Work (SOW), one for worldwide IDIQ awards and one for regional IDIQ awards. However for this RFI the attached DRAFT SOW covers all anticipated services and project/program efforts. The attached DRAFT SOW has changed substantially from the current AFCEE 4PA-E08 SOW. Sections 8.0, 13.2 and 14.0 are examples of scope areas that have been significantly revised or updated. Recommend review of entire SOW. All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Time &amp; Materials (T&amp;M) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with three additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION. These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br />ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF WORLDWIDE SERVICES<br />To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for environmental and traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM projects. The SRM projects will be limited to locations overseas and contingency operations (as defined under 10 USC, 101 (a)(13)). The anticipated services include:</p>
<p>&bull; Title I Services: Title I services are related to a specific construction project and consist of conducting field surveys and investigations to obtain design data and preparing contract plans, specifications, and cost estimates.

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CANCELLATION NOTICE FOR CABS IDIQ</span></strong><br /><br />The Government has recently&nbsp;reassessed&nbsp;its procurement strategy to replace the current SAS and SFS contracts. FABS and CABS (both issued under separate FBO announcments) were developed based on a&nbsp;funding projection of $755 M in total support over the life of these two programs.<br /><br />By late August 2011, the Government acquisition process resulted in the approval of $271 M in total procurement authority. This represented a $484 M (64%) reduction in what was initially projected. At this level, SMC&nbsp;dtermined that&nbsp;the benefits of managing and sustaining the two programs separately were not effective for a variety of factors. These factors&nbsp;included cost, acquisition cycle, efficiency, and overall economy of effort.<br /><br />As a result of this development, the SMC team has decided to <strong><em>CANCEL</em></strong> FABS and CABS as separate source selections and consolidate the requirements under a single procurement vehicle. SMC estimates the consolidation of SAS and SFS optimizes overall efficiency, effectiveness and consistency in managing&nbsp;both&nbsp;continuous change and the Advisory and Assistance Support Profiles. SMC considers the benefits of consolidation exceed those of other alternatives.<br /><br />Based on what has been stated above, SMC Acquisition and Financial Support (SAFS) has been established as the follow-on acquisition for Advisory and Assistance Support Services currently provided by the SAS and SFS programs.

<DESC>This requirement defines the Omnibus Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (OSETA) support services for the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO CBD) and all subordinate Joint Program managers (JPMs) and their project and product offices. This is a Non-Commercial Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with, when applicable, performance based task orders for the Joint Program Executive Office-Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) and other customers under the auspices of the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP).   The support required by this contract is categorized into five domain area requirements:  Program Management, Administrative, and Management Support; Specialty Medical; Engineering Management; Logistics and Sustainment and Electronics and Communication.  Offerors are permitted to propose as the Prime Contractor for only one of the five domains.  <br><br> 	JPEO-CBD Program Mgt, Administrative, and Mgt Support Domain.  The Program management, administrative, and Management Support Domain includes but is not exclusive to RDT&E management support, studies and analysis, operations research and quantitative analysis, policy review/development, program evaluation, program review/development, data collection, business & financial management, contract & procurement management, education and training, other professional services, other specialty studies & analysis, other management support, and photo, mapping and printing. <br><br> 	JPEO-CBD Specialty Medical Domain.  The Specialty Medical Domain includes but is not exclusive to bioengineering, biomedical, medical sciences, agricultural sciences, environmental biology, biological sciences, and psychological sciences.<br><br> 	JPEO-CBD  Engineering Management Domain.  The Engineering Management Domain includes but is not exclusive to simulation, specification development, systems engineering, technology sharing utilization, technical assistance, other engineering and technical services.<br><br> 	JPEO-CBD Logistics and Sustainment Domain.   The Logistics and Sustainment Domain includes but is not exclusive to acquisition logistics, system sustainment management, reliability & maintainability, reliability centered maintenance (RAM), designing for supportability, and performance based logistics. <br><br> 	JPEO-CBD Electronics and Communications Domain.   The Electronics and Communications Domain includes but is not exclusive to computer programming, computer and information sciences, design development, application of computer capabilities to data storage and manipulation, information sciences and systems, systems analysis, telecommunications, and ADP services. <br><br>The cumulative total of all task orders awarded to all awardees will not exceed $498,000,000 over the life of the contract.  The Government anticipates that there is a strong potential for Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) to materialize over the life of the contract.  Organizational conflicts of interest occur when a firm has access to nonpublic information that would give it an advantage in competing for work. Conflicts also could appear when a contractor is performing tasks that are subjective and could have a financial impact. These situations would include a company helping to prepare a statement of work and then bidding on the same project.  Due to the limitations of the 2009 Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act and DFARS Clause 252.209-7009(c) (Dec 2010), this action will be 100% set aside to Small Businesses. NAICS Code 541330, Engineering Services for Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, applies with a small business size standard exception of $27,000,000.   Offerors are strongly encouraged to joint venture, team with small businesses or establish a small business entity.  Performance of this requirement may include access or exposure to private information subject to compliance to FAR Subpart 52.224-1 and 52.224-2.  Performance of this requirement does include strict prohibition of dissemination of information / publishing that is subject to compliance with client requirements and data that is subject to data right restrictions by the client.  Any violation of such may result in administration of penalties.  The expectation is that one or more Firm-Fixed Price type contracts will be awarded and such recipients need not have an approved accounting system, but are still subject to restrictions/guidelines associated with defective pricing.<br><br>

<DESC>This amendment changes the number of participants for each unique company from 2 people to 4 people for attendance at both the Industry Day and one-on-one sessions.<br /><br />The amendment posted on 30 Nov 2011 changed the original response date from 16 Jan 2012 4:00 pm Central to 18 Jan 2012 4:00 pm Central.&nbsp; It also encouraged attendees to submit questions by email in advance of the Industry Day.&nbsp; Questions must be unclassified.<br /><br />All other items remain as originally posted.<br /><br />1. Background. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The Department of the Air Force is responsible for organizing, training, equipping, and providing forces to conduct offensive and defensive operations, to include appropriate air and missile defense, to gain and maintain air superiority, and air supremacy as required to enable the conduct of operations by U.S. and allied land, sea, air, space, and special operations forces.
<p>2. Description.</p>
<p>A. Submissions under ATI BAA with Supplemental Information. This announcement requests submissions under BAA HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA for the basic and applied research associated with an Airborne Weapon Layer (AWL) for the BMDS. MDA and the US Air Force (USAF) request submissions from industry in the areas of (1) airborne sensors, (2) air-launched kinetic interceptors, and/or (3) integrated sensor and interceptor approaches. The sensors, interceptors, and/or integrated approaches will result in end-to-end kill chains on existing or planned USAF combat aircraft, US Navy (USN) combat aircraft, or other innovative platforms. MDA and the Air Force are investigating an AWL that emphasizes engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory (boost and early ascent phases) while also providing capabilities for descent and terminal phase engagements. MDA and the Air Force request performance, cost, and schedule information on an AWL that can support a proof of principle flight demonstration within 3 years in order to determine its relative utility. The demonstration will serve as proof of technological feasibility and provide an assessment of producibility.</p>
<p>B. Concept of Employment. The information below provides a brief overview of expected basing, desired operational employment, and potential involvement of partners. Additional information on the Concept of Employment will be provided at the Industry Days.</p>
<p>(1) AWL capability will be forward based to provide immediate response to emerging crises and potential conflict. AWL capability stationed in the United States will provide Homeland Defense and rapid theater augmentation.</p>
<p>(2) AWL may be integrated in both offensive counterair and defensive counterair operations. Offensive counterair using AWL would likely focus on integration within attack operations packages. Defensive counterair operations would likely focus on engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory, but would also include area defense and point defense of critical assets. Offensive counterair and defensive counterair capabilities are to be provided in the context of their associated operational altitudes and positions. For more information on counterair operations, refer to Joint Publication 3-01, Countering Air and Missile Threats, 5 Feb 07 found here: www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_01.pdf. <br /><br />(3) AWL will be tasked to quickly integrate with air and naval forces to gain operational advantage over the adversary.</p>
<p>(4) AWL may conduct operations using decentralized execution with engagement authority delegated to the individual fire unit (platform operator). Delegation would be consistent with the rules of engagement, defended asset lists, and platform position depending on other missions assigned and maneuvers for self-defense.</p>
<p>(5) AWL will also transmit and receive data including situational awareness, sensor cues, and fire control solutions with other air, space, land, and maritime air defense assets using normal communication/data link and air defense networks. Integrated fire control engagements may occur based on AWL formation tasking, or they may be directed by engagement authorities outside the formation.</p>
<p>(6) AWL should be considered for Allies and multi-national partners through international armament cooperation.</p>
<p>C. Major AWL Components. Respondents should consider:</p>
<p>(1) Platform. Potential platform options include current or future fighters, bombers, or remotely piloted vehicles (RPV). For submission preparation purposes, respondents may use F-15C, F-35A, B-1B, MQ-9, and/or others as a baseline for their reply; however, innovative concepts using other platforms are encouraged.</p>
<p>(2) Sensors and Integrated Sensor Approaches. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should address the following functions: detect, track, target, and provide/support a valid fire control solution, state vector, and covariance at extended ranges from the ballistic missile launch site. Both organic and networked concepts will be considered. Sensor capability should support the full range of interceptor capabilities without degrading aircraft performance beyond that of current targeting pods on aircraft. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should also provide capabilities for engagements against multiple ballistic missiles, warheads, and/or reentry vehicles with capability for basic classification/typing and discrimination. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches may introduce new equipment, modify existing equipment, or integrate combinations of new, modified, and existing equipment to include radars, infrared search and track systems, targeting pods, etc. Modifications to existing equipment should not adversely affect primary mission functions of the platform.</p>
<p>(3) Interceptors. Interceptors should be compatible for carriage and employment across all speeds and G loadings for USAF fighters, bombers, and unmanned aircraft systems. Interceptors may be carried internally or externally on fighters, bombers, or RPVs. Interceptors for internal carriage should be sized and shaped to fit within an F-35A internal weapons bay without interfering with other internal weapons carriage and employment. Options that can be integrated on multiple platforms are desirable over single-platform concepts. Interceptors may also be compatible with carriage and employment from USN combat aircraft. Interceptors should be capable of engaging basic and complex ballistic missile threats. Interceptors may take an incremental development approach that provides an interim capability enroute to final capability. Final production interceptors should also meet insensitive munitions requirements. Interceptors should be compatible with carriage and employment from existing air-to-air and/or air-to-ground weapons stations on fighter, bomber, or RPV to the maximum extent practical. Unique equipment required for carriage and employment of interceptors shall be included in the interceptor reply.</p>
<p>(4) Communications. AWL platform will use current and/or planned platform-specific communications/data link capabilities to provide information to and receive information from other AWL assets or Missile and Air Defense Networks. This includes state vectors, covariance, and fire control quality data. Both organic and networked performance will be considered. Requirements for AWL communications capabilities beyond these parameters shall be included in responses.</p>
<p>(5) Integration. Respondents should address integration issues for sensor(s) or interceptor(s) onto the aircraft and interface with platform fire control and communications systems.</p>
<p>3. BAA Submissions with Supplemental Information.</p>
<p>A. Cost. Cost proposals should be prepared in accordance with the instructions as provided under the MDA ATI BAA, HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions. Please reference Section 6 of this document for information on obtaining these instructions. Additional cost information may be requested at a later date.</p>
<p>B. Schedule. Estimated schedule for the RDT&amp;E effort.</p>
<p>C. Proof of Principle Flight Demonstration Plans. Estimated schedule, cost, and risk for conducting a flight demonstration within 3 years.</p>
<p>D. Data Rights and Assertions.</p>
<p>E. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Risks.</p>
<p>(1) Overall TRL and substantiating evidence to support assessment of TRL.</p>
<p>(2) TRL of major system components and interfaces and substantiating evidence to support the given component TRL assessment(s).</p>
<p>(3) Test demonstration. Description of any near-term demonstrations which would provide the capability to observe targets of opportunity, determine target state estimates, and compare these estimates with the actual target states (test range developed, best estimate).</p>
<p>(4) Technical risks.</p>
<p>F. System Considerations.</p>
<p>(1) Kinematic intercept capabilities/envelope against ballistic missiles in all phases of flight (boost, mid-course, and terminal) as specified in the classified exemplar threat trajectories package.</p>
<p>(2) Operating area for each interceptor against ballistic missiles in all phases of flight as specified in the exemplar threat trajectories.</p>
<p>(3) Time-to-launch, given threat notification.</p>
<p>(4) Alternative missions or engagement regimes supported.</p>
<p>G. Sensor and Integrated Sensor Approach Performance. Applicable technical information is requested for items listed in Attachment 1: Sensor Performance Template.</p>
<p>H. Interceptors. Applicable technical information is requested for items listed in Attachment 2: Interceptor Performance Template.</p>
<p>I. Integration. Approach should address all integration issues for the sensor(s) or interceptor(s) onto the aircraft and interface with platform fire control and communications system.</p>
<p>J. Opportunities to leverage other programs to reduce cost, accelerate schedule, and/or fill multiple missions.</p>
<p>4. Industry Days. MDA and the Air Force will host AWL Industry Days on 12-13 December 2011. Discussions of technical and operational considerations will be held on the morning of the first day.

<p>This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to determine if capable, qualified small businesses (including Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, 8(a) firms, Small Disadvantage Business (SDB)) relative to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services (size standard of $7,000,000 in gross annual receipts or income as defined in 13 CFR &sect; 121.104) possess the capability to support EPA's Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR) with the assessment of potential risks, benefits, costs, economic impacts and other effects associated with the generation and management of hazardous and non hazardous solid waste. Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to any solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.</p>
<p>The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The intent of this notice is to request information from small business concerns for the assessment of potential risks, benefits, costs, economic impacts and other effects associated with the generation and management of hazardous and non hazardous solid waste. The EPA is seeking market research into whether capable small business sources are able to provide the technical and analytical services to support the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Economics and Risk Analysis Staff (ERAS) of the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR).</p>
<p>The EPA manages a broad-scale program designed to ensure that hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste does not pose unacceptable risk to human health and the environment. Within EPA, the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR) is responsible for overseeing a variety of regulatory and non regulatory activities focused on achieving and maintaining solid waste management safety goals, as established under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. These goals are updated and refined under the Agency's recently released strategic plan: "2003-2008 EPA Strategic Plan: Direction for the Future," and OSW's (OSW changed its name to ORCR in 2009) "Office of Solid Waste Strategic Planning Document: 2003-2008." The legal authority for the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery to perform work pertaining to these activities, as required under this contract, is established under the Resource, Conservation, and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976.</p>
<p><br />The mission of the ORCR is to encourage land-based practices that help ensure economic and environmental sustainability, safe materials/waste management, and ongoing waste reduction. ORCR's three primary Goals are: to promote the conservation of natural resources, to help prevent future contamination problems, and to clean-up existing contamination problems that have resulted from past practices. The technical support requirements are designed to help ORCR meet resource conservation, protection, and corrective action (clean-up) goals. Requirements for this contract cover <br />&bull; Data and information collection, analysis, and management <br />&bull; Development of methodologies and analytical models for analyzing the costs, benefits, economic impacts, cost-effectiveness, and other impacts of waste-related regulations, policies, and voluntary programs. <br />&bull; The identification and assessment of environmental indicators and performance measures, as well as analyses of policy options.<br />&bull; Ecological and human health risk analyses of waste handling practices and problems relevant to RCRA-managed wastes and other related environmental issues<br />&bull; Technical support for document preparation and revisions</p>
<p>ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT (LOE)</p>
<p>The estimated level of effort for this requirement, in professional labor hours, is:<br />&bull; A Maximum of 25,000 hours per year for a five (5) year contract; 125,000 potential hours</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT:</p>
<p>To help determine if this potential requirement may be set-aside for small business concerns, the government is seeking input from the small business community regarding their interest and capability in performing the tasks reflected in the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Government requests demonstration of capability by interested parties through submittal of capability statements. The government will evaluate the qualifications of interested parties based on their responses regarding capability of performing the draft PWS.</p>
<p>All capability statements must:</p>
<p>1. Not exceed and will be restricted up to ten (10) single-sided pages in length.<br />2. Shall be electronically submitted to the email address below by the stated deadline.<br />3. Include small business classification(s): (Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.) <br />4. Address technical competencies and management/personnel experience relative to: (a) the key task areas in the draft PWS; and (b) the overall business demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performance, and schedules. <br />5. List references as well as demonstrate experience in conducting projects of similar size, scope, and complexity in the past 5 years.<br />6. State the (a) average number of employees of the concern; (b) average annual receipts based on the last 3 fiscal years; (c) other current business commitments (i.e., contracts, etc.); and (d) a description of the concern's accounting system for estimating and accumulating costs under cost-reimbursement contracts-and whether or not those system(s) have been audited and/or approved by any Government agency.<br />7. Demonstrate the management capability, corporate structure, and financial capability to meet the needs of the anticipated level of effort and scope of this requirement. Note that any resulting solicitation under set-aside procedures will include FAR 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting.</p>

The synopsis, amendments and other information related to this sources sought as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on FedBizOpps and EPA's website.</p>

Questions and Answers 
12/5/11

1)	Is there a requirement for contract personnel to have access to national security program?
Answer: Contractor personnel are not required to have access to a national security program. 

2)	In reference to Performance Work Statement (PWS), Addendum B Section B4, Item 10:  What are the requirements for monitoring systems to determine if software has been compromised?
Answer:  VA will require the contractor to notify VA in the event of a compromise to the systems. The contractor will propose mitigation.
 
3)	In reference to PWS, B5.5, INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE:  What are the self assessment requirements?
Answer: Reference standards identified in B5.4.
4)	In reference to PWS, 5.3, VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE -5.6, SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  What level of professional medical staffing is required of the contractor? Will the contractor have reasonable access to qualified VA staff for collaboration on development projects?
Answer: Yes, the contractor will have access to qualified VA staff for collaboration on development projects.

5)	In general, is there further information that can be provided about the scope of the project. We are having difficulty determining the size of team needed to meet all of the scope requirements. For instance, upgrades/enhancements are rolled out quarterly but it's difficult to determine if the needed staff for this is a couple of developers or a dozen. Please provide guidance for determining the staffing level needed to properly maintain and enhance the system to meet the VA's needs.
Answer: No additional information will be provided.  

6)	The request for pricing states that we should complete the schedule of supplies/services as well as a labor category sheet of rates and hours by task. Are there required/defined labor categories or are you looking for the contractor to propose that? This will be difficult for areas such as the CART-EP/ICD module design, development and testing. The specifications need to be written by the contractor and then built. CCC has extensive experience in doing this but it is difficult to provide a fixed fee without the knowledge of the specifications. Can you provide any guidance for how this should be fairly estimated?
Answer: No guidance can be provided. 
7)	The request also states that the contractors will perform the work at the offices in Denver and space for up to 3 contractor's staff will be provided. Should we infer that the team needed for this scope is 3 resources or will additional space be provided if needed? Or can some of the work be performed remotely?
Answer: It is integral to have the contractor on site.  VA will provide work space for up to 3 resources, in the Denver VAMC facility.
