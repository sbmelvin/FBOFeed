This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source
control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of
DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing
knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor
qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the
intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected
items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that
required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be
economically obtained. The subject item requires Government source approval
prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical
data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full
and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government
for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new
source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a
new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with
your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems
Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares:
www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures
identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's
experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you
have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being
evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which
forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to
provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous
submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be
considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a
source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or
approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to
meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue
based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification

<CONTACT>James G. Whitt, Contracting Officer, Phone 2404027627, Email james.whitt@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources.
<p><br />Project Title: Development of Fact Sheets for Preventative Controls for Human Foods</p>
<p>Background:<br /><br />On January 4, 2011, President Barack Obama signed into law the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA; Pub. L. 111- 353), which, among other things, requires that FDA establish standards for conducting a hazard analysis, implementing preventive controls for the hazards, and documenting the implementation of the preventive controls by facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food ("preventive controls regulation").</p>
<p>The provisions within the statute require the FDA to issue guidance documents related to hazard analysis/preventive controls. The FDA intends to issue guidance that will explain the new requirements, including making recommendations for how to conduct a hazard analysis and determine appropriate preventive controls. The FDA anticipates that guidance specific to food types will also be needed. Technical information for development of such guidance documents has been obtained through prior FDA contracts.</p>
<p>To successfully implement FSMA, the FDA must also provide technical support to its own inspectors and compliance staff, as well as corollary staff in the states. The preventive controls rule that the FDA is developing will recognize that, within the new regulatory framework, there is frequently more than one way to comply and achieve FSMA's food safety purpose. Assessing compliance, thus, requires that the FDA and state regulators make well-informed judgments based on expert knowledge of industry production systems and food safety practices. Some of these judgments about ways to comply will be reflected in published guidance and some will be made in the context of individual inspections, where inspectors will need real-time support and technical input from qualified FDA experts. Information is needed on typical processes for a variety of product commodities to provide a "refresher" to investigators on a specific process/product commodity during preventive controls based inspections.</p>
<p>Summary of Requirements:</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to develop eight (8) draft preventive control fact sheets for human food that will provide an overview of the typical process (product flow) from receiving ingredients to shipping the finished product, summarize typical hazards (biological, physical, chemical) associated with these products and processes, describe key control measures to protect the product from contamination, note key sanitation/GMP requirements, and note any other relevant considerations, such as those related to transportation. The Contractor will be required to develop one (1) fact sheet for each of the following commodities:</p>
<p>1. Bakery products (focus on control of allergens)<br />2. Nuts/Nut Products<br />3. Fresh cut produce<br />4. Spices / Seasonings<br />5. Dairy Products - (Soft, unripened, fresh cheese; Semisoft cheese; Soft ripened cheese)<br />6. Chocolate/confections/candy (focus on control of allergens)<br />7. Breakfast cereals<br />8. Pasta (dry and fresh)</p>
<p>Draft fact sheets shall be developed for the commodities listed. Any change in the scope of the commodities (e.g., selecting a specific type of product within a commodity such as bakery products) must be approved in advance by FDA.</p>
<p>The fact sheets must include specific information about the primary hazards of concern, the types of equipment involved in processing the commodity, the mitigation strategies that are key in controlling the hazards of concern, the types of sanitation procedures applicable to the commodity (e.g., dry cleaning vs. wet cleaning) and the types of cleaning equipment/procedures likely to be used (e.g., vacuums vs. CIP systems), specific areas for inspectional focus, and conditions of concern.</p>
<p>In performing the work, the Contractor will need to apply its working knowledge of the food supply system infrastructure, food science, food safety regulations, industry and regulatory guidance documents, policies, and processes. Scientific references used by the Contractor must be documented for each fact sheet.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be nine (9) months from the contract effective date.</p>
<p>Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 15 pages (font size - Times New Roman 11 or larger). A copy of the company capability statement will also be accepted (but not in place of providing responses to the questions). After review of the responses received, a combined synopsis/solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to the NAICS code, and must respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Is your business a small business under the NAICS code? <br />2. Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business? <br />3.

Does your company have any prior experiences with FSMA requests (Government or Commercial)? If so, explain in detail.<br />10.

(2) At the time of contract award; and,
(3) During the full term of the contract.
Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.
