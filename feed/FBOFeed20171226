name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the
following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) is conducting market research to obtain information regarding services to assist in the management of internations clinical research efforts. The United States Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) Division of Medicine is currently developing enhanced clinical research efforts in South America to enhance the ability to study and respond to emerging pathogens in this region which have the potential to put service members and the civilian population at risk of infection.</p>
<p>The goal of the program is to identify and characterize emerging pathogens before they become a threat to public and military health. Researchers have established collaborative ties to clinical research sites in Colombia. Through IRB approved research protocols, samples have been collected and shared with USAMRIID researchers with the aim of characterizing emerging pathogens proactively investigating causes of severe illness in the region. This effort is complicated by the difficulties associated with procurement of supplies at the local sites; language barriers to communicating with physicians and medical staff; and overarching awareness of epidemiological events that might be established on a local but not on an international level. In order to position USAMRIID ahead of the outbreak response, it is imperative that improved communications and procurement pathways are established to ease collaboration in the region.</p>
<p>The Recipient would assess and report on the changing epidemiological situation in regions of interest; provide expertise on clinical protocol development and approvals, such as: import and export permits, ethics board approvals; provide expertise on establishment of international agreements with local hospitals and research institutions; procure consumables required for research activities; provide logistical support for clinical observational trials, such as patient enrollment, communication, sample and collection; and provide shipping and packaging expertise for clinical specimens.</p>

Supply Specifications   Requirements:
Salient Characteristics and Contract Specifications:
All par levels will be stocked in accordance with the par levels identified and agreed upon in the consignment agreement.
Advance Micro 14 PTA Balloons:
The lowest profile balloon available on the market. The only balloon small enough to be used as the primary treatment modality from a pedal approach through a micro puncture kit (no sheath upsizing necessary). The balloon and distal shaft are hydrophilically coated to facilitate navigation through tortuous anatomy and help cross lesions. Wide range of shaft lengths to make treatment possible from a variety of access sites (groin, popliteal, pedal, etc.) 
Advance 18LP PTA Balloons:
 D - shaped lumen for rapid inflation and deflation during multiple-inflation procedures. Special flex-tip for navigating tortuous distal anatomy. Available in 3 shaft lengths: 80cm, 150cm and 170cm. Available in OTW (over the wire) and RX (rapid exchange) configurations. Reinforced shaft for extra push ability.
Advance 35LP PTA Balloons:
Made of proprietary Pliaform material for durability as well as friction reduction when crossing lesions. Starcast short balloon shoulders for precise treatment and superior balloon rewrap in procedures requiring treatment in multiple areas. D- shaped lumen for rapid inflation and deflation. Low profile- an 8mm x 8cm balloon can pass through a 5Fr sheath.
Zilver Self Expanding Stents:
Hydrophilic and stainless steel reinforced shaft for accurate stent delivery in tortuous anatomy. Easy to use deployment system with minimal product preparation (saline flush only). Constructed from interconnected Nitenol Z-shaped segments for excellent radial strength and optimal longitudinal flexibility. 
Zilver PTX:
The ONLY FDA approved drug-eluting stent for use in the SFA and proximal popliteal. The best long-term patency data on the market from the largest SFA study ever conducted.
Retractable Detachable .035  Coil:
This is the only detachable coil on the market that can be repositioned as many times as necessary after it has been pushed beyond the catheter tip. It provides the most precise placement available, which makes it ideal for any embolization procedure (where an error in placement can have very serious consequences).
Zennith AAA:
Both the Flex main bodies and Spiral-Z limbs are preloaded in Flexor hydrophilic sheaths that work coaxially. There is no need for sheath exchange. The Zenith AAA line offers the widest range of lengths and diameters in the market, therefore offering the most off-the-shelf, yet customizable treatment option for each patient. The Spiral-Z limbs have the best patency data on the market.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in January.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for January is January 1, 2018 to January 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG03 and must be located within Region 3.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>

Background / Introduction     This acquisition will upgrade an existing NanoDrop 1000 (EE 42392) with NanoDrop One which reliably quantify DNA and RNA concentration checks accurately and reproducibly in seconds within the Molecular department, Microbiology Section, Pathology and Laboratory Service, Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center (RLR VAMC).

The Microbiology/Molecular section of the Clinical laboratory is an integral part of the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Services. This ever-growing section of the laboratory serves testing needs for the RLR VA Medical Center, referral patients from Indiana University Health Hospitals and VA VISN hospitals. At present, this section performs DNA and RNA tests specimen testing through manual or semi-automatic processes and the sending-out of specimens to supporting contractors. 

The required quantity and quality of DNA or RNA is very important for conducting further tests ordered by physicians or research.  These aspects assure valid quality test results for assays in which quantified DNA must be used. This is key to complying with international evidence-based guidelines jointly published by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) in 2013 recommended all lung cancer patients with adenocarcinomas should be tested for the genetic abnormalities that indicate suitability for treatment with targeted agents, irrespective of clinical variables such as sex, ethnicity, or smoking status.  This section also complies with the 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for DNA (EGFR test) mutations; in which physicians, may later prescribe, as appropriate, erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib as first-line therapy in patients.
Currently, DNA and RNA tests are also sent out to supporting contractors. The number of tests sent out has measurably increased since 2013. Beginning in FY 2017, this section will use the FDA-approved Roche COBAS 4800 system for DNA/RNA (EGFR, BRAF and KRAS) testing which will be utilized in-house lab to perform tests versus send out testing.  This will require an upgraded NanoDrop unit to be integrated into the overall test process. 

Scope   The Microbiology/Molecular section seeks a purchase/replacement of a NanoDrop instrument for necessary concentration checks of quantity and purity of DNA and RNA samples.  The instrument will remain key to valid quality results for follow-on patient specimen tests and research.

This instrument is to be a standalone unit with local control and high-resolution touchscreen and direct printer. Test results are displayed on screen; with follow-on printing or stored via USB.  It should possess the capability to accurately measure DNA/RNA in a range of 0.2 to 27,500 ng/ul (dsDNA). The unit must also possess the latest technology, e.g., an Auto-Measure function, pre-programmed applications, measuring highly concentrated samples without the need for sample dilutions, an embedded sensor for digital image analysis for measurement integrity. The unit possesses a sample-retention system and provides direct microvolume measurements from 1-2 ul of sample. Equally important is that the unit s capability provides sample analysis with contaminant identification and corrected results. Embedded sensor and digital image analysis ensures measurement integrity.  Preferably, a 2-year service plan is included at no cost. The device will not have WIFI or Bluetooth capability.

Objectives   The objective of this acquisition is to enhance the RLR VAMC mission performance and quality by purchase of an updated NanoDrop instrument for use with the COBAS 4800 system.  

Tasks     CAPCOM ECAR approval with subsequent contracting purchase order.

Delivery    The NanoDrop instrument must produce quality DNA and RNA concentration checks accurately and operate reliably in a high-test volume environment. 
 
Items will be packaged, shipped, and/or returned using standard industry practices that include sufficient protection of the items from possible damage caused by improper shipment or handling.  The packages will be temperature-dependent, depending on the items enclosed. All required documents (i.e. packing/shipping paperwork and return documents) shall be included with the shipment.  

Government Furnished Equip     This purchase replaces equipment listed as EE 42392.

Security     This is a standalone unit and will not be interfaced to any VA system.  Should WI-FI be a standard accessory it will be disabled. 

Place of Performance     Most specimens continue originating in the RLR VAMC region. Other specimens originate with VAMC partners and adjacent VISNs.  All testing occurs at Pathology and Lab service, RLR VAMC. 

Period of Performance -   Specimen testing remains ongoing.

Authority: 

ORDER AGAINST FSS:  Authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USC 251, et seq.); Title 40 USC 501, Services for Executive Agencies; and Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2002 (PL 107-107) and implemented by FAR 8.405-6.  Mark the applicable exception:

  An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays(FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A);

  Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B));

  In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order and the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C)); or

  Items peculiar to one manufacturer. An item peculiar to one manufacturer can be a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer). A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer (FAR 8.405-6(b)).

Rational/explanation to support cited authority:
The SPiNDrive Thoracic Navigation System is the only system in the world that allows physicians to accurately access small lesions via multiple approaches. Veran s hybrid lung diagnostic procedure, SPiNPerc, provides physicians with the capability and flexibility to perform needle-guided biopsies of the lungs when an endobronchial approach cannot reach the lesion. SPiNPerc helps streamline patient care by taking the multiple procedures, departments and visits required to do a lung biopsy and reducing it to one procedure, one department and one visit. SPiNPerc is the only proven cost effective patient care pathway 

BRAND NAME ONLY:  This buy is estimated to exceed $25,000 and this documentation will be posted along with the RFQ on e-Buy, as required by FAR 8.405-1(e).

Note that this determination satisfies the requirements of FAR 8.405-6.  The requirement to prepare a written justification IAW FAR 6.303 does not apply to Federal Supply Schedules.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart<br />204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>5152.233-4000 HQ AMC LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM (FEB 2014)</p>
<p>Prior to submitting an agency protest, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve your concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.</p>
<p>Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command<br />Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road<br />Rm: A6SE040.001<br />Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000</p>
<p>Fax: (256) 450-8840 or email usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil</p>
<p>The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at:<br />http://www.amc.army.mil/amc/commandcounsel.html.</p>
<p>If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMC-Level Protest Procedures.</p>

<p>1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR)</p>
<p>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contact<br />ed</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

USAID invites organizations and companies to submit an Expression of Interest, as provided in Section III below. USAID and stakeholders, through the co-creation process, will strive to design a program that will use innovative, private-sector led, scalable, transparent, and sustainable approaches or models that facilitate increased exports of conflict-free minerals, particularly gold; and refine and accelerate the adoption of approaches and models in gold mine sites that strengthen artisanal and small-scale (ASM) miners/ASM communities' resilience to conflict through enhanced economic activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The intent of the BAA is to allow co-creation and co-design to the maximum extent to create high-quality, effective partnerships with great efficiency in time and resources. USAID will invite selected public, private, for-profit, and nonprofit organizations, as well as institutions of higher education, public international organizations, non-governmental organizations, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental organizations, multilateral and international donor organizations, as detailed below, to co-create R&amp;D solutions to the Problem and Challenge Statements stated in this BAA in Section II.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Co-Investing: The purpose of this BAA is to align USAID goals with a range of partners to facilitate shared responsibility, shared risk, and shared resourcing. Shared resourcing requires that cash and other resources, both tangible and intangible, such as in-kind contributions, expertise, intellectual property, brand value, high-value coordination, and access to key people, places, and information, are directed towards reaching the solution to the Problem/Challenge. Co-investing does not require equal shared resources (such as 1:1 leverage), but rather resource contributions that are appropriate to the specific project's objectives, considering the comparative advantages brought by the participation of each party.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">See attached documents for further instructions on submission of Expressions of Interest.</p>

The LPTA process supports a  pass/fail  approach based upon successful contractors meeting the minimum criteria for acceptable award.  The criteria are listed in the Statement of Work. The technical evaluators will reject offers that do not meet the minimum criteria. The award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.  Exchanges may occur. Quotes are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors.  Tradeoffs are not permitted.  Offerors will be rejected that do not meet the special standards or minimum criteria listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.
   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

E.3  VAAR 852.211-73  BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (JAN 2008)
  (Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)
  (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
  (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
  (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
      (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and
      (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
    (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:
      (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and
      (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.
    (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered.

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(2) [_] Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.</p>
<p>(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).</p>
<p>[_] TIN:_____________________.</p>

L. 113-235) and its successor provisions in subsequent appropriations acts (and as extended in continuing resolutions), Government agencies are not permitted to use appropriated (or otherwise made available) funds for contracts with an entity that requires employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report waste, fraud, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.</p>
<p>(2) The prohibition in paragraph (u)(1) of this provision does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312 (Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement), Form 4414 (Sensitive Compartmented Information Nondisclosure Agreement), or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information.</p>
<p>(3) Representation.

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart<br />204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart<br />204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Prior to submitting an agency protest, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve your concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.</p>
<p>Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command<br />Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road<br />Rm: A6SE040.001<br />Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance. This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined.

Quoter/Offeror certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes.<BR><BR>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>Amendment 0002 is being issued to revise the synopsis to change the requirements for maintenance for each location.
<p>Offerors that initially proposed must acknowledge change and resubmit to be considered.</p>
<p>This is being issued pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 12 and 13 under simplified acquisition procedures for a commercial item as a combined synopsis solicitation prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This notice constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED separate from this announcement. Solicitation number EE133E-18-RQ-0053 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). You may submit your written quote on company letter head or on a Standard Form 1449. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAR Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-96 effective November 6, 2017. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 811310 with a size standard of $7.5M. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br />The period of performance is 12-months from date of award with two additional 12-month option periods for the Barrow systems.   A)  For the option periods, assume no service at Fairbanks site; service is only needed in Barrow pursuant to FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  (B) For Fairbanks, include as an optional second preventative maintenance of the two USPs between September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Environmental Satellite data and Information Service, Field Delegate requires the following:<br />PURPOSE:<br />The purpose of this procurement is to establish a Service Support Agreement (SSA) for maintenance and support for the Uninterruptable Power Source (UPS) systems at the NOAA/NESDIS Fairbanks Command and Data Acquisition Station (FCDAS) in Fairbanks, Alaska, and at the FCDAS remote antenna site in Barrow, Alaska.</p>
<p>SCOPE OR MISSION:<br />FCDAS requires preventive maintenance and technical support for emergency power systems and components, including batteries, on-site emergency service, travel to and from the sites, labor, replacement parts, tech support, call management, field modifications, emergency telephone support 7 days/week, 24 hours/day. FCDAS provides essential satellite ground system services for earth observation spacecraft in support of property, life, and economic activities of the United States. Electrical power is mission-critical, and the UPS systems provide conditioned electrical power to all ground system equipment, including temporary power continuity in the event of a commercial power outage. Regular preventive maintenance and technical support on the UPS systems is required to maintain 99.9999% availability of critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />FCDAS is a 24/7 satellite tracking station operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in support of national and international operational and research environmental monitoring spacecraft located near Fox, Alaska, approximately 15 miles northeast of Fairbanks. <br />FCDAS plans to replace the existing UPS systems in the summer of 2018. The new UPS will be under warranty and no services will be needed for it under this solicitation.   FCDAS also operates an unmanned satellite tracking system at the NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory in Barrow, Alaska. Barrow is a remote community on the North Slope where travel and working conditions are often difficult. The FCDAS UPS systems consist of two MGE Uninterruptable Power Source (UPS) Model E6TUPS500 UPS systems, S/N 208488.01 and 208488.06, which are critical elements of the electrical power infrastructure on site. The systems condition power and provide temporary backup power to the entire site. In the event of commercial power failure, the UPS systems hold station power for up to 30 minutes or until station generators automatically engage. The Barrow UPS consists of one APC UPS Model SUVTP15KF4B4S, 15kVA 208V 3PH UPS with battery modules and one SBPSU10K15F-WP External Maintenance bypass panel. The Barrow site does not have emergency generators, and the UPS is intended to feed conditioned power to the antenna equipment for brief commercial outages.</p>

<p>The following FAR clause is provided in full text:</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. <br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical capability, and past performance. Best Value Approach:<br />_X_ Tradeoff: This process allows for a tradeoff between non-cost factors (Mission Capability; Past Performance) and cost/price and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or other than the highest technically rated proposal to achieve an overall best-value contract award.<br />(b) "Options." The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.

This document is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.

 The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.  Tiered evaluation of offers,  also known as  cascading evaluation of offers,  is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when market research is inconclusive for justifying limiting competition to small business concerns or sub-categories of small business concerns. The contracting officer  
(1) Solicits offers from both small and other than small business concerns that will be evaluated in the following tier order: 
(a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB); 
(b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB); 
(c) all other small business concerns; 
(d) other than small business. 
(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can be made. 
 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit. Interested persons may submit offers, and all eligible offers received prior to 1:00 PM PDT January 3rd, 2017 will be considered by the Government. The NAICS code is 325120 and the size standard is 1000 Employees. 
This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-89 effective, July 14, 2016.
Products shall be supplied in accordance with the specifications, terms and conditions contained herein. In addition, the following FAR and VAAR clauses will also apply. Thank you.

C.1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

Only electronic offer will be accepted. Offers are due by 1:00 PM PDT January 3rd, 2017.

Alternate system submission: Offerers submitting alternate items must provide technical information sufficient for a lay person to determine acceptability. Information will not be paid for by the government nor returned to the supplying party. The information will be used to determine product acceptability. Lack of sufficient information for our staff to determine product acceptability will result in a negative determination.  Any quote will then be found nonresponsive to the solicitation and the quote will not be considered.

New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured, used/refurbished or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. No product in development shall be considered.

Authorized dealers: Experienced firms only who are authorized dealers will be considered in addition to the original equipment manufacturer. A letter from the manufacturer stating your company is an authorized dealer for the line items must be in possession by the due date and be available for submission, if requested.

FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price
and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:
  The Government will award to the lowest price, technically acceptable offeror. Brand name or equal. 
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.
