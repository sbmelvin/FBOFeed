<DESC><p>The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Linde, Inc., New Providence, NJ, for atmospheric gas analysis services. This sole source acquisition is justified under to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Evaluation of Linde's unique capability and acquisition history concluded that the highly specialized effort required is available from only one source. The services to be acquired are primarily concerned with the processing, separation, and radioassay of atmospheric gas samples for elemental determination of sample components for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification. Definition of some terms: bottle = 900cc steel container filled with whole air constituents requiring processing for analysis; sample = physical object requiring processing to isolate selected atmospheric radioactive effluent gasses of interest for analysis. Gas analysis requires the ability to: (a) be proficient with various radioactive gas counting techniques; (b) determine, prior to separation, the percent of oxygen and nitrogen and the volume (in cubic centimeters) of other selected effluent gases within sample bottles; (c) separate selected radioactive effluent gases, as required, from cryogenic arid whole air samples; (d) radioassay separated samples; and (e) maintain capability to process and analyze samples from surge of additional collections, as required. Requests for these analyses may occur with little notice and may require 8-hour to 24-hour analysis capability. Other requirements include: (a) possession of a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Radioactive Materials License (or an agreement state license/permit, as applicable for the facility where work will he performed), prior to performance start; (b) providing a suitable site for performance of the contract requirements. Unique analysis equipment essential to the mission will be provided, with ownership retained by the government. Due to the potential of contaminating mission samples, analysis equipment and areas of any facility used for gas analysis services shall not be used for activities other than government work without the expressed written permission of the government program office and shall be isolated from other facilities doing nuclear work; (c) possession of both a facilities clearance and storage capability of at least the SECRET level, and (d) ability to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET level. A firm-fixed-price contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541380/$12.0 million. No technical or solicitation documents exist at this time. Although the government has determined that Linde, Inc. is the only source capable of providing this requirement, interested firms who have not previously submitted capability statements in response to the sources sought synopsis published 02 Dec 08, may identify their capability to meet the above requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 15 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Firms responding must state whether they are a Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, a Native American firm, a HUBZone firm, a Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a participant in the Very Small Business Pilot Program, or a large business based on the size standard above. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited. The clause at Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation (AFFARS) 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this request. In accordance with AFFARS 5301.9103, the first sentence of clause 5352.201-9101 paragraph (c) is tailored to read: If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Air Force Space Command ombudsmen, [HQ AFSPC/A7K, 150 Vandenberg St., Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, FAX 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil].</p>

<DESC>NASA HQ has a requirement for engineering, technical and administrative support forthe program and projects of the NASA Technology Evaluation for Environmental RiskMitigation (TEERM) Principal Center, the Agency Energy Program, and internationalcollaborative efforts.	The support will be provided Agency-wide in the areas of TEERMsupport, international agreement operation, energy and water conservation and monitoring,interagency working group on hydrogen and fuel cell support, programmatic environmentalassurance, management system support, conference planning and execution and greenengineering advancement support, information management and administrative supportservices.  NASA entered into a Joint Statement with the Portuguese Ministry of Urban Affairs,Spatial Planning and the Environment to cooperate on environmental matters in September2002.  The operating entities for activities under the Joint Statement are the NASAEnvironmental Management Division and the Centro Para Preveno da Poluio (Center forPollution Prevention) (C3P).  The Joint Statement is currently in the process of evolvinginto a legally-binding agency-to-agency agreement under US law due to the success of therelationship.  It is also anticipated that a government-to-government agreement underinternational law requiring extensive State Department coordination will be the next stepafter signing the agency-to-agency agreement and is expected to be finalized no earlierthan 2010.  It is imperative that we maintain access to the special relationship betweenthe International Trade Bridge, Inc (ITB) president and the Portuguese Government as welearn to operate the implementing arrangements under the new legally-binding agreementrequirements.  ITB has extensive international experience especially with the Portuguese Government, andthis relationship is critical to the success of this program.  During this critical timeof dramatically changing and expanding international interaction, it is important toremember that European, and in particular Portuguese, activities depend heavily on thequality of the relationships between interacting parties.  The long-standingrelationships of the ITB President with General Branco, Director General of Center forPollution Prevention (C3P), and with the Portuguese Ministry of Environment play a keyrole in fostering successful collaboration.Therefore, NASA/HQ intends to purchase the items from International Trade Bridge, Inc.There were no other firms determined that possess the international relationships neededto meet Agency commitments.  No other company addressed the requirement for therelationships required to operate the international agreement activities or internationalactivity expansion at all.  The authority is FAR 6.302-2,(c)(1) only one responsible source available.  When thesupplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsiblesource, or, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number ofresponsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agencyrequirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing, by FAX or e-mail, to the identified point of contact not later than4:30 p.m. local time on 06/21/09.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. FAX or e-mail anyinquiries to the identified point of contact.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is a neutron research facility. The research facility is used to perform a broad array of state-of-the-art biology, materials, chemistry, and physics research by measuring the interaction of radiation with various materials to study their structure and properties.  Some of the research performed at the NCNR is fundamental in nature, other research is directly applicable to problems of immediate societal interest. 

Two cranes are currently installed at the NCNR:
A Kranco C-100 which is a 15 ton polar unit on the first floor. Span: 33’ 3”; Serial Number 1848; and A Kranco C-200 with a 20/2 Ton Bridge crane on the second floor; Serial Number 1847.  These cranes were installed at the NCNR in 1964.  While both cranes are fully functional, the C-100 is in need of updating and modernization.  

Work under this acquisition shall provide an overhaul of the C-100 crane. No work shall be performed on the C-200 crane.
	
The period of performance shall be four months from the date of award.  The actual crane overhaul must be performed within a 10 day window. 

This requirement is being procured using simplified acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 333923 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.    

In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the manufacturer and distributor of these supplies must be a small business in accordance with the NAICS code identified.  For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end item being acquired. The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired.  The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or components were assembled or transformed.  The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semifinished as a raw material to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item. 

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, attachments, and any subsequent amendments related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-09-RQ-0154.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure on a sole source basis for the Generation of Custom Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody directed against Human Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 (FGFR4), with Epitomics, Inc.; 863 Mitten Road; Suite 103; Burlingame, CA 94010-1303.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

Only one award shall be made as a result of this solicitation.  Period of Performance shall be from date of award through 12 months.  

The purpose of the requirement is to develop high affinity rabbit mAb to neutralize FGFR4 which might be exploited as adjuvant therapy for metastatic disease.  Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 is over-expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma and the expression is correlated with advanced disease and poorer survival.

The NCI requires Rabbit Monoclonal Hybridomas (antibodies) generated through fusion of spleen cells of immunized rabbits with Rabbit Plasmacytoma cells (240E or their derivatives). The antibodies will be directed against specific proteins relevant to Cancer research.  Epitomics is uniquely qualified to design, develop and deliver the antibodies as part of the continued research studies within the NCI.

Epitomics is the only source known to the NCI that has an exclusive license for the 240E cell line that was developed by Katherine Knight at Loyola University. The founders of Epitomics cloned the cells and isolated derivatives that are more stable and more productive than the parental cells.  These improved cells are used in their protocols for development of rabbit monoclonal antibodies.   In addition, Epitomics owns the patent for the Rabbit Plasmacytoma fusion partner required to generate hybridomas from rabbit spleen cells.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Contractor shall provide one (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM ET June 22, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed or emailed to the following: Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  It is the contractors’ responsibility to ensure all questions have been received in the contracting office.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA).

This gimbal system will be utilized on the MUSCL craft, and has been selected based on both its extremely compact design (weight of approximately 2.34 lb) and that it utilizes the same IR (FLIR Photon 320) and EO (SONY FCB-EX980S) sensors utilized by the CCT program.  Use of identical sensors will decrease the required efforts to integrate this system into the Operator and Control Station.  Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to purchase this gimbal, since it provides for commonality between systems and reduced integration costs.  These items will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City, Fl 32407-7018.  NAICS CODE:  334511.  SBA !

<a href="mailto:Schuller.Nicole@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 561920   The office of Air Programs, Stratospheric Protection Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to AgriculturalResearch Consulting for support of the 2009 Methyl Bromide Alternatives Outreach (MBAO) Conference, to be held at the end of November 2009. The support will include conference planning, conference organization and implementation and distribution of conference proceedings. 
The annual Methyl Bromide Alternatives Outreach (MBAO) conference is the only worldwide conference focused on sharing research and field trial experience relating to methyl bromide alternatives. The MBAO conference has been in effect since 1994 and continues to serve as a useful platform for sharing information, as the January 1, 2005 phase out of methyl bromide has taken effect. The period of performance will be from date of award to March 31, 2010.
Only Agricultural Research Consulting is able to organize and host a conference on alternatives to methyl bromide in a timely, inexpensive and effective manner that avoids a significant waste of government resources and insures government objectives will be successfully accomplished. First, obtaining conference services from a different source would require organizing a completely new conference from its initial stages. Second, EPA's contribution is joined by that of USDA and other entities. Were EPA to organize and host a conference on its own, the cost of doing so would be greater than the amount EPA contributes to the organization of the MBAO conference. Third, any new conference would not have the reputation or institutional history of the MBAO conference and would not attract the same caliber of presenters or the same attendees.
Due to the nature of this procurement, EPA believes there is only one responsible source capable of meeting these requirements. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a response, which is received by COB, Friday, June 19, 2009, will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Construction and Leasing Of Office/Laboratory Space

Pre-Solicitation Announcement

The Federal Government has a requirement for the construction and full service leasing of a new Wildlife Disease Research Building (WDRB) to be located at 4101 LaPorte Avenue, Fort Collins, Colorado on land to be leased from Colorado State University.  The building will be occupied entirely by U.S. Department of Agriculture and other Federal tenants as determined by the General Services Administration.

The National Wildlife Research Center (NRWC) presently has a long term ground lease with Colorado State University.  The successful Offeror will enter into a ground lease with the University and a full service building lease with the General Services Administration (GSA).  The proposed building shall contain approximately 13,000 BOMA office area (useable) square feet of office and laboratory space for use by the tenant for personnel, furnishings, equipment, and public use areas.  The space shall be designed and constructed to meet the requirements of a self-contained Bio-Safety Level (BSL)-3 Laboratory and BSL-3 Ag animal holding and testing space.  The building must be capable of being fully accessible to the physically handicapped, must meet minimum seismic requirements and will be subject to any and all other building or construction rules, regulations, laws and/or ordinances on the local, county, state and federal levels as they may apply.

The Government may enter into a sole source procurement with Colorado State University in the event interested party(ies) are unable to indicate they are highly qualified to meet the Government’s requirements for past performance.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider past performance factors including the ability to finance, develop, construct and provide full service operation of facilities of similar complexity.  Interested parties will also need to provide evidence that they are able to secure the necessary land lease from CSU.  

The government is seeking a 20-year firm term lease with two 5-year options.  The General Service Administration does not have the Authority or does not intend to seek authority to award a lease that exceeds the congressionally imposed Prospectus Threshold.  Such space shall be ready for occupancy no later than fall of 2012.

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any Expressions of Interests or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building’s ownership. 

A written statement of interest should be submitted by February 20, 2009  to: Dan McPherson, c/o General Services Administration, Colorado Service Center (8PC), P. O.

<DESC>The Government intends to award, on an other than full and open competitive basis, a Firm Fixed Price, five year indefinite quantity/delivery (IDIQ) type contract.  The contractor shall furnish all depot level labor, facilities, special tooling, test equipment and materials/parts.  Separate pricing is required for:  (a) Overhaul, (b) Repair, and (c) Teardown, analysis, repair, rebuild and testing of recently overhauled engines.  Input/Output NSN: 2840-01-013-1339, P/N: 6887191.  Minimum quantity is 10, and maximum quantity of 600 each.  The Depot Maintenance Work Requirement (DMWR) is outdated and not adequate for competition.  Subsequent to award of the previous contract for overhaul, the T63-A-720 Turbine Engine was classified as a critical safety item.  As such, and in accordance with DFARS, Subpart 209-2, and FAR Clause 52.209-1, award of this current effort is restricted to approved sources.  Currently, the only approved source is the OEM, Rolls Royce Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana.  The Government does not own a technical data package necessary for the overhaul of the T63-A-720 engine.  Overhauls must be in accordance with the OEM's proprietary overhaul manual that has been reviewed and approved by AMCOM.  Other sources that wish to become qualified to overhaul the T63-A-720 Turbine Engine must submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) in accordance with the instructions provided at the Competition Management Offices webpage located at the following weblink: http://www.redstone.army.mil/cmo/samsar.html.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W912DY09R0023.<br><br>This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) Program. The purpose of the DESC program is to support federally funded petroleum facilities and military installations under the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), DESC, other Department of Defense (DOD) Activities, and other Federal Activities throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions (CONUS and OCONUS)with compliance programs for tanks, piping, separators, dispensing units, and support facilities procurement/installation, and maintenance requirements. These services will consist of those actions required to preserve and maintain Government petroleum real property facilities in such a condition that they may be effectively used for their designated functional purpose. In order to accomplish this objective, the DESC program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts (MATOC), under which firm-fixed price (FFP), or time and materials (T&M) task orders may be issued. <BR><BR>Work will be accomplished through performance based work statements stating the measurable performance standards, and performance incentives where appropriate. Preventive maintenance tasks will be defined as re-current, periodic or scheduled work to preserve a facility by preventing its deterioration.  Other maintenance may be ordered for non-petroleum systems such as for separators, piping, tanks, sewers, storm drains, etc.  Minor Repair will be defined as the restoration of a real property to such a condition that it may effectively be utilized for its designated purpose by overhaul, reprocessing or replacement of constituent parts or materials that have deteriorated by action or elements or usage and that have not been corrected through maintenance.  Periodic testing of systems/components, generally on a quarterly basis, is included within the DESC definitions of maintenance and repair. Other repair may be ordered for non-petroleum systems such as for separators, piping, tanks, sewers, storm drains, or requirements to meet compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Some maintenance funded construction services will be required to support the continual operation, maintenance and use of these facilities, systems, and equipment. These construction services may involve the alteration, conversion, and/or reconfiguration of petroleum facilities, systems, and equipment. Specific work requirements to be performed include:  maintenance and repair of exposed piping, system components, pumps, valves, electrical and static grounding, aboveground storage tanks, belowground storage tanks, swivels and swing joints, ground cables, disconnect switches, surge arrestors, class III systems, gaskets, filter separators, water drains, micronic filters, cathodic protection, dikes, AFSS, ATG, and system control panels, vacuum and pressure vents, liquid level gauges and low-level controls, high-level control valves and alarms, dispensers, and tank gauges, starters and contactors, wiring and fuse boxes, grounding conductors, flow meters, dispenser calibration, vapor recovery system, pressure gages, pressure relief valves and shear valves, static ground rods, and hoses.

<DESC><p>The 45 Space Wing issues this sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the possible acquisition of atmospheric gas analysis services. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited. The services to be acquired are primarily concerned with the processing, separation, and radioassay of atmospheric gas samples for elemental determination of sample components for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification. Definition of some terms: bottle = 900cc steel container filled with whole air constituents requiring processing for analysis; sample = physical object requiring processing to isolate selected atmospheric radioactive effluent gasses of interest for analysis. Gas analysis requires the ability to: (a) be proficient with various radioactive gas counting techniques; (b) determine, prior to separation, the percent of oxygen and nitrogen and the volume (in cubic centimeters) of other selected effluent gases within sample bottles; (c) separate selected radioactive effluent gases, as required, from cryogenic arid whole air samples; (d) radioassay separated samples; and (e) maintain capability to process and analyze samples from surge of additional collections, as required. Requests for these analyses may occur with little notice and may require 8-hour to 24-hour analysis capability. Other requirements include: (a) In the event the government elects to procure atmospheric gas analysis services, prospective sources must possess, or show the capability to obtain, a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Radioactive Materials License (or an agreement state license/permit, as applicable for the facility where work will he performed), prior to performance start; (b) Offerors shall be responsible for providing a suitable site for performance of the contract requirements. Unique analysis equipment essential to the mission will be provided, with ownership retained by the government. Due to the potential of contaminating mission samples, analysis equipment and areas of any facility used for gas analysis services shall not be used for activities other than government work without the expressed written permission of the government program office and shall be isolated from other facilities doing nuclear work; and (c) Prospective sources would be required to have DOD security clearances of at least the SECRET level. A firm-fixed-price contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options. Participation in this potential effort would require both a facilities clearance and storage capability of at least the SECRET level. Prospective sources would be required to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET level. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541380/$12.0 million. No technical or solicitation documents exist at this time. Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Firms must respond electronically to Ms Lois Brockson at lois.brockson@patrick.af.mil within 30 days from the date of publication. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Firms responding must state whether they are a Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, a Native American firm, a HUBZone firm, a Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a participant in the Very Small Business Pilot Program, or a large business based on the size standard above.

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR 15.201(e), the NSWCDD is issuing a Request for Information (RFI).  The RFI is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
The NAICS Code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  

The Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG) Experiment and Assessment 2010 (PEA-2010) is being formulated in consultation with appropriate service and joint offices as well as industry and academia.  Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) to enable industry to provide information about technology solutions, which are sufficiently mature to support field experimentation in an operational Joint Force Protection context with emphasis on Proactive Defense.  The Proactive Defense concept engages the enemy before he attacks and accelerates the defense time-line once he attacks to reduce the risk to critical assets and personnel.  Capabilities which enable this concept may be experimentally examined during FY10 and possibly FY11.  
The PEA-2010 Experimentation Phase will comprise a series of potentially iterative experiments, conducted periodically at one or two service sites that have special facilities associated with the objective technologies.  The experiments are planned to be conducted beginning in Jan 2010 and completing by Dec 2011.  Each of the experiments will have a focus area such as the following:	1. Integration of Biometrics, high-resolution Sensors and parametric fusion for Threat Identity	2. Integration of Forensics, Counterintelligence and Counter-surveillance 	3. Inter-Agency Communications, Shared Databases and Interoperability	4. Shared Situational Awareness and Synchronized Defense
The progress in each sequential experiment will become part of the foundation for the next experiment, enabling more substantial fusion of information and more information sharing in each successive experiment.  Independent assessments of some of the key performance attributes will be provided by an appropriate organization.
The interoperability standards, defined by the Security Equipment Integration Working Group (SEIWG) of PSEAG, will be applied to the architecture for PEA-2010 (reference a).  Fusion technologies will be used to fuse the information from Threat Identity tools and Situational Awareness capabilities to accelerate the timeline of defense activities.  Automation will be applied to increase capabilities without increasing manpower.  Prototype systems that are mature enough to enable rapid transition to operational capabilities will potentially be integrated for experimentation.
Entrance Criteria.  The Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) as defined by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) to indicate the state of technology maturity, apply to this experimentation; relevant levels are defined in Table 1.  The proposed criteria for selecting prototype capabilities for inclusion in the PEA-2010 are as follows:	1. Enables Joint Force Protection Proactive Defense	2. Potential Operational Utility and Efficacy	3. Readiness for Experiment in 2010/11 	4.Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 or higher preferably and TRL-6 minimum 	5. Interoperability Potential	6. Potentially Synergistic with other capabilities	7. Affordable Experiment/Demonstration	8. Low to Moderate Risk	9. Identifiable Transition Path	10. Service or Joint Office Interest/Cooperation
Table 1. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Descriptions
TRL-5. Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment:Fidelity of breadboard technology increases significantly.  The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so theycan be tested in a simulated environment.  Examples include "high-fidelity" laboratory integration of components.
TRL-6. System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment: Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond that of TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment.  Represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness.  Examples include testing a prototype in a high-fidelity laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment.
TRL-7.  System prototype demonstration in an operational environment:  Prototype near, or at, planned operational system.  Represents a major step up from TRL 6, requiring demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment such as an aircraft, vehicle, or space.  Examples include testing the prototype in a test bed vehicle if appropriate.
TRL-8.  Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration:Technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions.  In almost all cases, this TRL represents the end of true system development.  Examplesinclude developmental test and evaluation of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it meets design specifications.
TRL-9.  Actual system proven through successful mission operations: Actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions, such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation.  Examples include using the system under operational mission conditions.

The Government has a requirement for an additional 16,000 contiguous useable square feet of office and related space. The total rentable space must yield a minimum of 31,055 useable square feet.  It is acceptable to have two separate blocks of approximately 15,528 useable square feet of contiguous space in the same building. 

The delineated area is Washington, DC Central Business District, and the West End.

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

• Proximity to Metrorail/ Metro Bus
• Parking (# of on site, reserved spaces (inside vs. outside) for official Government
vehicles)
• Security (i.e. lobby, loading dock access, parking, etc.)

The Government is considering whether to expand at the existing location or to relocate to alternative space which can meet the entire space requirement.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s entire requirement for a five year term, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, rent payments on vacant space under the existing lease and/or cost of buyout, etc.

<DESC>Market Survey for a Linear Demolition Charge System (LDCS) for the Assault Breach Vehicle (ABV)<BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as CONFIDENTIAL under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR><BR>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR><BR>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Governments rights in the data.<BR><BR>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS.<BR><BR>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>6.  The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as Confidential will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.<BR><BR><BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<BR><BR>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<BR><BR>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT:<BR><BR>      The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps requirements for a Linear Demolition Charge System (LDCS) for the Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV).   The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series of steps.<BR>      The ABV is a tracked combat engineer vehicle for the Marine Air Ground Task Force & Army Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT).  It is designed to breach minefields & complex obstacles and provide in-stride breaching capability to maneuver forces.  It is a new capability in the 2nd generation HBCT Combat Engineer Company.  It consists of an M1A1 Abrams tank hull,  linear demolition charge system which employs two M58 Linear Demolition Charges and two MK22 Rockets mounted on a fabricated turret controlled by a Linear Demolition Charge System (LDCS), various front end equipment, an Integrated Vision System (IVS), and a 2-lane marking system.  It is operated by a crew of two Soldiers/Marines.  The LDCS must meet the following performance requirements:<BR>      1.  The LDCS shall be mounted onto the ABV and allow for maintenance access to the vehicle and demolition charges.  The LDCS mounting system shall be incorporated into the Jettison subsystem.  The Jettison subsystem shall be mounted to the turret subsystem, which rotates +90 and 90 degrees from normal turret forward direction to allow for access to rear hull hatches.<BR>      2.  The LDCS shall use two M58 Linear Demolition Charges and two MK22 rockets.  It shall be able to control the operation of and be able to mount to the line charge system on the ABV but is not comprised of them.<BR>      3.  The LDCS shall use a control box to operate the system from under armor.  The control box shall operate either the left or right side system, and shall be controlled by the ABV commander.  The control box shall independently control either LDCS, but not both at the same time.  The LDCS control box shall, at a minimum, provide a visual indication to the commander that the LDCS has functioned properly. <BR>      4.  The LDCS shall incorporate an independent lock out to prevent accidental actuation of the LDCS or actuation of the system when the MK22 rocket is not properly elevated.<BR>      5.  The LDCS shall survive the materiel-damaging effects of Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) contaminants and decontaminates.  The LDCS shall be decontaminable to negligible risk levels to reduce NBC Hazards to personnel operating and maintaining the system.<BR>      6.  The LDCS subsystem shall be operated with the turret at 0 degrees from the longitudinal Axis of the vehicle [normal turret forward direction].  The LDCS shall elevate the MK22 rocket to a pitch angle of 45 degrees, +/ 2 degrees relative to the vehicle.<BR>      7.  The LDCS shall require no more than 20 seconds (threshold), 10 seconds (objective) to completely elevate the MK22 rocket.<BR>      8.  The LDCS shall require no more than 45 seconds (threshold), 25 seconds (objective) to completely function and detonate the explosive. <BR>      9.  The LDCS shall be based on non-developmental item (NDI) components and weigh no more than 6,500 pounds.<BR>      10.  All external mechanisms and electronic components of the LDCS must be watertight/waterproof to preclude damage during deep-water fording operations.<BR>      11. The LDCS will be compatible with other 24-volt military vehicle electrical systems.<BR>      12.  All internal and external components of the LDCS shall be furnished with identification information printed on corrosion resistant, metallic data plates in accordance with ANSI Z535.4.  Registration numbers and markings shall be block style lettering, in a location readily visible.<BR>      13.  Material selection, paint finishes and processes shall avoid use of toxic chemicals, hazardous substances and ozone depleting chemicals for production, maintenance, repair, operation, shipping, handling and reclamation.  <BR>      14.  All parts having the same manufacturers part number shall be interchangeable.<BR>      15.  The LDCS shall be painted in accordance with MIL-P64159 Type II, Water Reducible Chemical Resistant Coating.<BR>      16.  The LDCS shall be able to operate during all types of climatic and weather conditions without degradation, including rain, snow, hail, ice, fog, dust, sand, and high humidity. The operating temperature range of the LDCS shall be -25o to +125oF.  The LDCS shall, with normal prescribed maintenance, be capable of operating without degradation in an environment where there is a 5% +/- 1% concentration of salt fog.  It must be able to be operated and stored in environments where there is blowing sand and dust particles.  The LDCS shall, with normal prescribed maintenance, be resistant to the corrosive effects of a severe marine atmospheric environment consisting of seawater splash and spray, and occasional seawater immersion during operation, transport, and storage.  <BR>      17.  The LDCS design shall use the guidance in the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) G82 to determine materials compatibility.  <BR>      18.  All LDCS components shall meet the requirements of MIL-STD-461E for radiated emissions RE 101, and RE 102, and susceptibility RS 101, and RS 103 to the extent possible.  Deviations from the stated standards shall be identified.<BR>      19.  The design of the LDCS shall be user friendly whereby the required skill sets for operation and maintenance do not exceed those of the 1316, 1341, 1345, 2111, 2146, 2176, and 2841 USMC Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) and 21B, 63A and 62B U.S. Army MOS.  Design of the LDCS shall include the following human factors for ease of use:  <BR>      a) Components shall not restrict operator activity or present an unsafe situation, <BR>      b) Warning labels/indicators must be used to warn of human hazards, <BR>      c) Where applicable, cables must be labeled and easy to connect and disconnect, <BR>      d) Control and displays shall be easy to locate, and <BR>      e) Visual indicators and messages shall be easy to read in all light conditions.  <BR>      20.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey, Rocky Mountain Geographic Science Center (RMGSC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with NatureServe, 1101 Wilson Blvd., 15th Fl., Arlington, VA  22209-2211 to provide a development of a Terrestrial African Ecosystems Classification with Map-Enabling Attribution as follows:
a) A list and descriptions of vegetation/environment assemblages at the following hierarchical layers: Class, Subclass, Formation, Divisions, and Macrogroup, produced by experts in pre-workshop consultations and a four day ecosystem classification development workshop in Nairobi. 
b) For Macrogroup level ecosystems, a spreadsheet showing most probable attributions of land cover, isobioclimate region, ecological division (Divisions in the hierarchy above),landform class, surficial lithology, and topographic position (lowlands vs. uplands) for each identified macrogroup-Ievel ecosystem. These attributions will subsequently be used as rulesets for aggregating and labeling previously mapped physically distinct areas into ecosystems.
The RMGSC currently supports a USGS effort to map terrestrial ecosystems in Africa as part of a partnership with the US Agency for International Development (US AID) and NASA. The final step in this process requires the classification and labeling of the actual ecosystems, however a continentally comprehensive classification (list and descriptions) of African ecosystems does not yet exist. Therefore in order to complete this effort the need exists to execute and manage a process to develop an ecosystems classification to be used as the framework for completing the African ecosystem map. 
Since the current effort in Africa is only part of a larger global effort taking place under the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) intergovernmental protocol, it is crucial that the classification developed for Africa corresponds with existing classifications. In fact the classification system developed for Africa must employ the same conceptual and organizational logic and hierarchical layers as in NatureServe's classification of ecological system for Latin America and the Caribbbean (Josse et aI., 2003), and NatureServe's ecological classification system for the United States (Comer et aI., 2003). Since these other classifications were developed by NatureServe, development of the African classification by anyone other than NatureServe would involve a significant loss in previously gained experience and effort. 
Firms who feel that they can furnish the required product described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar products must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the product identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.

---------------
A.	 General Information
The Heartland, Northeast, & Mid-Atlantic Regions collectively referred to as Logistical Support Area -  (LSA) North, seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for Disinfectanting Surface Cleaners  for its Army, Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and US Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF’s) in the region.  The Heartland Region has been designated as the Lead Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) for this standardization initiative.  Standardization action for this product line represents a new initiative.  Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria below, will be disqualified in Phase I.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.  The 13 Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) that will be participating in this standardization initiative are:  Northeast Region – Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), Washington, DC; Andrews AFB, MD;; Dewitt Health Care System (DHCS),; National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) - Bethesda, MD.  Mid-Atlantic Region— Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC), FT Bragg, NC; Kenner Army Health Clinic (KAHC), FT Lee, VA; National Naval Medical Center (NNMC), Portsmouth, VA;  Pope Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC, and Naval Hospital (NHCP), Camp Lejeune, NC.   Heartland Region-Wright Patterson Air Force Base Medical Center (WPAFB), Dayton, OH; Naval Health Clinic, Great Lakes, IL; Ireland Regional Army Community Hospital, Ft Knox, KY, and Scott AFB Clinic, IL.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Regions current PV Owens & Minor.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their products.  This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement to the PV Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s PV program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is October 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.
Point of Contact Tracy Martin-Tilghman 202 782-3663 tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil and Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil

B.	Products and Performance Required
The LSA North Region is seeking product line items in the category of Disinfecting Surface Wipes, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within the LSA North region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $314,010. This forecast is based on historical CDMIA sales for a 12-month period.  The top-ten (10) high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.   At the request of the LSA North Regional  MTF’s vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors
DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil 202 782-3663.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.

This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Regions’ Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria
The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF’s within the LSA North Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.
The LSA North Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor’s best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor’s best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor’s best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor’s DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the LSA North Region).  Additionally, the LSA North Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process
Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their “intent to participate” to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB by the Clinical Product Team (CPT), to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will qualify and be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, “acceptability” for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of “technical acceptability.”  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:
1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Disinfectanting Surface Cleaners products.  A ‘complete line of product’ is defined as the MTF’s requirements for ‘usage items’ in the product line.  ‘Usage items’ are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  XL SURFACE DISINFECTANT WIPES EXTRA LARGE ( 66 WIPES/CANISTER - 12 CANISTERS/CASE); SURFACE DISINFECTANT WIPES REGULAR SIZE ( 160 WIPES/CANISTER - 12 CANISTERS/CASE); HOSPITAL CLEANER DISINFECTANT WITH BLEACH, TRIGGER, 32OZ; SANI CLOTH PLUS LARGE.   LOW ALCOHOL GERMICIDAL DISPOSABLE WIPE. KILLS TB, PSEUDOMONAS, HIV-1;  24 OUNCE SPRAY(12/CS); SANI-CLOTH HB - LARGE.  CANISTER, ONLY PREMOISTENED WIPE THAT KILLS HEPATIS B; A-33 DRY - DETERGENT/DISINFECTANT; SANI-CLOTH PLUS - XLARGE (14.85% ALCOHOL); SUPER SANI-CLOTH INDIVIDUAL XL.  GERMICIDAL DISPOSABLE WIPE FOR HARD SERVICES.  KILLS TB, MRSA; SURFACE DISINFECTANT SPRAY GALLON BOTTLE (4 GALLONS/CASE).   
2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  (Literature must contain efficacy studies)  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.
3.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Disinfectanting Surface Cleaners product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) 
4.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current Prime Vendor for the LSA North Region, Owens & Minor, for distribution in the LSA North Region.  (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  
5.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.
6.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. 
7.	Vendors must include product Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) in response to this RFQ.   
8.	In response to this RFQ, vendors must provide a sample of typical individual item packaging information (label) which includes instructions for use, product lot number, expiration date, precautionary use/safety information, disposal instructions, and EPA registration as a hospital disinfectant with label claims of kill times regarding tuberculocidal activity. If product contains bleach, labeling must carry EPA/FDA registration. 
9.	Vendors must show evidence that spray bottles have both stream & spray delivery in response to this RFQ.

Phase II-Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Upon completion of the Phase I – Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.

Clinical Evaluation Process: For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.

Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor’s product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient-care setting using a Likert-like scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.50 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.

During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.

Clinical/Performance Criteria:
1. Clinician Safety-Contents of each packet are easily identified. 
a.	Allows staff to quickly select products. Save time.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical/patient care setting 
c.	Products will be observed during the evaluation
2. Patient Safety- Disposable wipes are strong enough to prevent tearing during use.
a.	Save time. Tearing or shredding wipe may cause incomplete contact and affect kill times
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical/patient care setting 
c.	Products will be observed during the evaluation
3.  Staff Compliance/Staff-Patient Comfort - Disposable wipes scent/odor is not offensive during dispensing and/or use.
a.	  Offensive scent/odor may cause allergic/sensitivity response in staff and/or patients.

Price Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).
2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB.  Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with the potential for three (3) one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).
3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.
4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?); and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.  Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

<DESC>Description:

SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY: Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) is responsible for providing for the transportation needs of the Department of Defense (DOD) including the movement of DOD freight traffic and U.S. Government shipments of Foreign Military Sales material.  SDDC has a requirement for a firm fixed-price, Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the surface transportation of freight all kinds (FAK) and hazardous materials (HAZMAT) shipments within the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and is seeking interested small business sources capable of providing the services required.  The contractor shall furnish all labor, supplies, materials, supervision, transportation, equipment and performing all operations required in connection with the IDIQ contract.  The NAICS code is 484121.

A.  This sources sought notice is to determine if this requirement should be set aside for small business participation in accordance with FAR 19.502-2(b).  The market research survey is to identify small business capability to perform the following requirement:  

1.  The work includes the surface transportation of approximately 12,500 truckload (TL) and 12,000 less-than-truckload (LTL) freight all kinds (FAK) and hazardous materials (HAZMAT) shipments within the Contiguous United States (CONUS).  

2.  Provide monthly performance reports to the Contracting Officer.

B.  The following will be a contract requirement:

1.  Carrier shall be an approved DOD freight carrier.  (Approved by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command’s (SDDC) Freight Carrier Registration Program (FCRP)).  See the following website for complete details: http://www.sddc.army.mil/public/Doing+Business+with+SDDC/

2.  Carrier shall be certified to transport hazardous materials (HAZMAT).

3.  Carrier shall participate in the US Bank PowerTrack billing and payment system.

C.  The guaranteed contract minimum is $25,000 which applies to the basic one year period only.  The contract period will be for a base one-year period with two (2) one-year option periods.  The Government reserves the right not to exercise the option year periods.

D.  In the event the Government issues a 100 percent Small Business Set-Aside request for proposal (RFP), FAR Clause 52.219-14—Limitations on Subcontracting will apply.  FAR Clause 52.219-14 is a mandatory, material solicitation requirement; therefore, the small business prime contractor will be required to agree to perform at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel with its own employees.  In addition, the small business prime contractor will be required to submit a plan describing how they will comply with this mandate.  An excerpt from FAR Clause 52.219-14 is below:

FAR Clause 52.219-14 (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for— 

(1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. 

E.  The information obtained in response to the questions listed below are for market research and will help determine the most suitable approach to acquire the services listed in the sources sought notice.  The small business size standard for NAICS code 484121 is $25 million.  

1.   If your business is a small business, what type is it?  (Small Business, HUBZone SB, SDB, WOSB, Service-Disabled VOSB)

2.  What is your DUNS number and CAGE code?

4.  Is your business capable of transporting approximately 12,500 truckload (TL) and 12,000 less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments throughout the Contiguous United States (CONUS) each year?

5.  If this requirement is set aside for small business, does your company intend to submit a proposal for this requirement?

6.  If this requirement is set aside for small business, will your business be able to comply with the requirement of FAR 52.219-14 (prime contractor must perform at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel with its own employees)?

7.  If you answered yes to question 6, briefly describe in sufficient detail how your company will be able to accomplish the surface transportation requirements while simultaneously meeting the requirements of FAR Clause 52.219-14—Limitations on Subcontracting.  This description is limited to one page. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  INFORMATION PROVIDED IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.  THIS AGENCY HAS NOT MADE A FINAL COMMITMENT TO PROCURE THE STATED REQUIREMENT AND THIS MARKET RESEARCH SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT OR AUTHORIZATION TO INCUR COSTS IN ANTICIPATION OF SUCH PROCUREMENT.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) - The 678 ARSS intends to issue a sole-source contract to McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company (hereafter referred to as The Boeing Company), for the B-2/Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). The objective of the B-2/MOP program is to execute a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) program for a 30,000 lb. class, GPS/INS guided weapon that will be integrated on the B-2A. The Government anticipates award on or about December 31, 2009, of a Fixed-Price type contract for the build of up to 20 weapons (5 test articles and 15 residual assets) and integration onto the B-2A platform.
<p>The statutory authority, which permits other than full and open competition for this acquisition, is 10 United States Code (USC) 2304(c)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). This authority will be supported by an approved J&amp;A. A Sources Sought Synopsis was previously issued on 30 April 2009, Reference Number 678ARSS30APR09. Taking into consideration the responses to this Sources Sought synopsis, it is the Government's intent to proceed with a sole-source action.</p>
<p>The MOP is currently a technology demonstration program with the goal of developing and demonstrating a conventional, 30,000-lb. class penetrator bomb designed to defeat hard and/or deeply buried targets (HDBTs). The requirement for the MOP QRC is a single (one weapon per aircraft bay) weapon approach to defeat a specific set of HDBTs. The MOP offers the flexibility to be loaded and employed from the B-2A with no additional Operational Flight Plan (OFP) modifications. This allows the program to meet the deadlines to begin flight tests by June 2011 and to reach Required Assets Available by June 2012.</p>
<p>Under the contemplated contract, The Boeing Company will provide all supplies and services necessary for the final design, testing, qualification, fabrication, and integration of the MOP onto the B-2A aircraft platform (including any ancillary equipment). Fabrication of the MOP weapons will consist of 5 test assets and up to 15 residual assets. Note: At this time, the best estimated quantity for MOP residual assets is 10, as noted in the Sources Sought Synopsis.</p>
<p>This notice neither constitutes a RFP or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does it restrict the Government in any way to an ultimate acquisition approach. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>The Air Armament Center has appointed an Ombudsman to hear concerns from potential offerors relating to this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer previously identified. For any other concerns, interested parties may call the Air Armament Center Ombudsman, Col Arnold W. Bunch, Jr., AAC/CV, 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495, (850) 882-5422.</p>
<p>For further information, contact the Contracting Officer, Mr. Ron Foskey, 678 ARSS, (850) 883-1699. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No costs will be paid for any charges incurred in responding to this synopsis.</p>

<DESC><p>In accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1(c) (ii), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole contract to Association of Schools of Public Health to provide&nbsp;publication in the journal Public Health Reports.
<p>The reduction of health disparities and health equity promotion are top priorities for the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. An urgent need exists to increase the number of peer-reviewed publications that focus on reducing health disparities and examine the link with social determinants of health. Currently, there are few studies that have examined effective methods to address social determinants of health in our efforts to prevent and control HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis. In addition, there are a limited number of published studies examining social determinants and associated strategies that can be systematically prioritized to produce the greatest impact in accelerating the reduction of health disparities in these diseases. Moreover, studies focusing on developing and identifying key metrics which might be used to better measure and monitor the impact of social determinants on health on these diseases are not present in the literature.</p>
<p>The publication of the supplement will advance scientific knowledge and public health research and policy on addressing social determinants of HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, STD, and tuberculosis and may impact CDC's public health work in reducing health disparities.</p>
<p>To publish in a journal, the accounts of public health programs, initiatives and research in addressing social determinants of health and HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, STDs and TB. Publication in a journal will make those experiences accessible by public health officials involved with prevention and control of these diseases.</p>
<p>The Association of Public Health School&nbsp;will publish a collection of scientific and programmatic articles describing social determinants of health and its link to HIV, viral hepatitis, STD, and TB in a special supplemental issue of Public Health Reports in late spring/early summer of 2010 in the standard format for supplemental issues of Public Health Reports. The title of the issue will be Addressing Social Determinants of Health in HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Tuberculosis. The supplement will be comprised of approximately twenty manuscripts with an average estimated length of 5-7 pages. The number of manuscripts will vary and is subject to change based on suitability of each manuscript for publication.</p>
<p>The contractor will edit and peer review the articles and provide feedback to the authors. The contractor will design, layout, provide galley proofs to CDC, print, and distribute the supplemental issue to the established readership of the journal. Additional copies of the issue will be supplied to CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.</p>
<p>It is the understanding of the Government that an award to any other source would cause unacceptable delays in meeting the requirements of the Government. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the services. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive requirement. Please send your documentation to Deborah Workman by fax (770) 488-8350, or email to atl7@cdc.gov. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC. A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notification, is solely within discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT  -  Brand Name Justification for Trusted Integration Software License, License Maintenance, and Professional IT System Support Services

The Internal Revenue Service intends to award a blanket purchase agreement for commercial items and support services.  The blanket purchase agreement will be issued to a Federal Supply Service (FSS) schedule contractor.  This agreement will be made under the Authority of FAR Part 11.105 and FAR Part 52.211-6  -  Brand Name or Equal.  

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandated the use of IT Security software in 2006.  The TAF/TACA Software was purchased in 2006 because it best met Treasury’s requirements and has been in use at the Department of the Treasury and all Treasury bureaus since that time.  Additional licenses and modifications to the software were also purchased in 2007 and 2008.  These products are necessary to continually comply with the Treasury IT policies and procedures as required by OMB and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The Treasury is requesting TAF and TACA perpetual products licenses and license maintenance for new and currently owned software licenses.  The Treasury is requesting TAF/ TACA software support services to maintain and enhance the TAF system.  Only one manufacturer produces the TAF/TACA software.  The software licenses and maintenance can only be purchased from the manufacturer.  Further, the software is proprietary in nature and can only be modified by the manufacturer.  Since the software is already installed, has been customized for the Department of the Treasury, and has been in use since 2006, switching to another brand of this type of software would be impractical, costly, and not in the best interest of the Department of the Treasury.  Purchase of additional licenses of another brand of software would also not be practicable as the existing software would not be able to communicate with another brand of the same type of software and would cause the Treasury to run two redundant systems, again impractical and inefficient.  The TAF/TACA software currently captures security information for over 500 systems.


The blanket purchase agreement will be to one GSA FSS schedule contractor.  Solicitation Number is TIRNO-09-Z-00012.  Award will be made on or before June 9, 2009.  Questions can be e-mailed to Lakita.C.Ayers@irs.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) of University Washington, D.C. for Seminar Support for NISTIR 7563 Guidelines on Fire Resistance Design Draft for Public Comment needed in the Building, Fire, and Research Laboratory at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.

Congress established a public/private partnership to enable findings on technical, building-related matters to be used effectively to improve government, commerce and industry.  NIBS bring together representatives of regulatory agencies, legislators and representatives of the private sector to open working sessions that seek a consensus solution to problems of mutual concern.

NIBS are uniquely qualified to coordinate the contributions of professional societies from key design professionals responsible for structural fire resistance design of concrete and steel buildings.  NIST has developed, working through NIBS, a document, Best Practice Guidelines for Structural Fire Resistance Design of Concrete and Steel Buildings, which is currently in the form of a draft for public comment. This document aims to integrate information on current practice in fire resistance engineering with current best knowledge in fire risk assessment, characterization of design fires, material properties at elevated temperatures, and thermal and structural response calculation methods.

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service in Aberdeen, ID has an oligo pooled assay for barley BOPA-1 will be used to interrogate 1,536 alleles in three different mapping populations.  The populations have been specifically developed to map barley stripe rust resistance BCD47/Baronesse diastatic power 01Ab8219/Shellar and B-gulucan soluble  fiber Falcon/Azhul.  Since the USDA ARS Genotyping Laboratory in Fargo, ND already has the BOPA primers and the instrumentation Illumina BeadStation we will need to purchase the consumables for the assays.  Parents and RILs will be sent to Fargo with consumables and the USDA Genotyping will run the BOPA assay.  The data will then be returned to ARS Aberdeen and new molecular linkage maps will be constructed with the data.  The maps will be used to identify genes controlling each of the aforementioned trails.  The USDA intends on negotiating with the only known source Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA for Sentrix Universal-96 Array Matrix 1536-plex quantity five GT-103-1213 and GobadnGate Assay kit with UDG 96 samples quantity five GT-96-205.

<DESC><p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This requirement will be for a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract with one basic and one option period. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as request for proposal No. FA8900-09-R-0004. The United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) requires Aeromedical Flight Instruction services. Training will be for Aerospace Medicine Primary (AMP) students and include "ground school" and flight-related academic lectures in a group setting, and provide a dedicated flying training unit that will permit student control with an instructor in all phases of flight. The flying demonstration and proficiency curriculum will be specifically designed to expose flight surgeon students to the rigors of flying, mission planning, modern cockpit symbology, disorientation, instrument techniques, aerobatic and formation flight. <br />The government seeks a vendor to provide an "operational" aviation training unit. This unit is to be initially established within a 30 mile radius of Brooks City Base, Texas area. The contractor will furnish all aircraft, aircraft maintenance, labor, training facilities and physical and personnel security. The requirements are for validation, small-scale testing, large-scale testing, and partial implementation of the USAFSAM Aerospace Medicine Primary Course, Flight Surgeon Flight Practicum syllabus (attachment 2). It is estimated that 1320 hours of aircraft flight time, 2350 hours of certified flight instructor time, and 1060 hours of flight surgeon/pilot time will be required for the basic contract year and it is estimated that the total of flying hours for the Option period is 1350 to 2700 hrs. The number of aircraft, flight instructors, and flight surgeon/pilots required to meet this contractual obligation will increase with each successive element. It is estimated that validation (element 1) will require a maximum of two aircraft and two flight instructors. Small-scale testing (element 2) will require a maximum of three aircraft and three flight instructors. Large-scale testing (element 3) and partial implementation (element 4) will require one or two flight surgeon/pilots and enough aircraft and flight instructors to fly a minimum of 8 sorties per day. The basic year will consist of three student classes and the Option period will consist of three student classes (see PWS attachment 1 for details). There will be two CLINs for the basic consisting of a FFP CLIN 0001 for Program Cost (i.e. program manager, student flight gear, ground preparation/instruction, student briefings, CFI instruction in Aeromedical fundamentals, data and reports) and a FFP CLIN 0002 - 870 hrs for Flight Hour costs (consisting of Element 1 - 60 flight hours, Element 2 - 90 flight hours, Element 3 - 270 flight hours, and Element 4 - 450 hours). Option period will also have two CLINs consisting of a FFP CLIN 1001 for Program Cost (i.e. program manager, student flight gear, ground preparation/instruction, student briefings, CFI instruction in Aeromedical fundamentals, data and reports) and a FFP CLIN 1002 (for pricing purposes please use 2000 hrs) for Flight Hour costs. (Price for CLIN 1002 will be evaluated using an estimated quantity of 2000 hours.) Pricing info should be broken down by the cost for each of the four elements described in the PWS.

<DESC>The Federal Executive Institute intends to award a sole-source non- commercial item contract pursuant to FAR Part 6.3.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. The Federal Executive Institute (FEI), U.S. Office of Personnel Management, intends to issue a cost reimbursement contract to Josh Waitzkin to provide executive level educational course(s) in support of FEI’s Horizons Series Program on or about September 24, 2009.  The value of the contract is estimated at $25,000.  The programs are to be delivered at the United States Military Academy’s Alumni Association Building in West Point, NY.  The tuition based seminars are available to senior executives (SES) exclusively as part of FEI’s SES Leadership Horizons series.    

Requirement 

The Federal Executive Institute (FEI) offers a series of exclusive leadership programs for members of the Federal Senior Executive Service (SES).   As a cohort, the SES has been traditionally underserved in terms of specific programs and content tailored to the unique needs of their leadership context, whether as new Federal leaders or seasoned members of the executive cadre.  These executives, upon whom the public relies for  leadership performance at the highest level possible within a challenging public service environment,  require executive education that addresses the mental skills that underlie peak, top-line executive performance.  Addressing confidence despite setbacks, concentration amidst distractions, and composure under stress are but a few of the challenges these executives face as public servants who strive to work for America in an era of unprecedented demands and complexity.  FEI’s mission is to better prepare senior leadership to address those and other pressing issues in order to best perform their missions.  

FEI plans to offer an SES-only course of 3 days duration built around two key modules:  1) The leading edge work done by the Cener for Enhanced Performance at the US Military Academy at West Point and 2) The Art of Learning, an interdisciplinary approach to learning and peak performance and excellence developed by Mr. Josh Waitzkin.  As part of this SES only course, Mr.  Waitzkin, an internationally known expert on peak performance, will discuss his personal sports psychology training regiment that allowed him to win multiple titles of World Champion Chess Master and World Champion Marital Arts winner, and will discuss some of the latest neuroscience applications to leader development.  In addition, the program will address Psychological Capital research, theory and practice as it pertains to executive peak performance.  Mr. Waitzkin will draw together his personal experience, training, and knowledge of world class competition with leading research in sports psychology, Psychological Capital, and the neurosciences to demonstrate principles and practices for executive leader development.  In addition, mental strength and confidence in any endeavor, attention control and increasing pattern recognition and problem solving ability, adaptive thinking, mental agility, self-regulation, and applying leading edge goal-setting methods to specific individual and organizational goals are all developed in this highly interactive program.   FEI intends to utilize Mr. Waitzkin to design and deliver the appropriate, focused content for The Executive Zenith program, given his specific and exclusive role in developing The Art Of Learning concept, learning experiences based upon it, and a book of the same name

Sole Source Justification 

Mr. Waitzkin has offered to work with FEI to provide a one-of-a-kind professional development opportunity for FEI participants as part of the SES Leadership Horizons series.  The combination of his personal experience and background as a World Champion Chess player and World Champion Martial Arts winner and his teaching experience which draws from sports psychology, Psychological Capital, and the neurosciences provides a unique experience for executives interested in achieving personal and professional excellence through attention to attitude, mental acuity, motivation, and commitment.  Through his personal experience of training for world competition, and his journey of discovery, conquering the high pressure mental challenges of intensely competitive chess face-offs and extremely physically challenging marital arts competitions, he was able to develop internal mental processes from systematically triggering intuitive breakthroughs to mastering the art of performance psychology.  Specific concepts (personal experience as World Champion Chess/Martial Arts, the use of sports psychology principles, Psychological Capital research, and neuroscience research) as melded together by Mr. Waitzkin are not known to be available from other individual or executive education organizations at this time.  Mr. Waitzkin also authored a highly regarded book that is a core component of the seminar materials.  This is a unique opportunity for FEI to collaborate on a senior leaders program that will benefit members of the SES.  

Period of Performance. 

The resulting agreement with Mr. Waitzkin in FY 2009 is one program offering from 23 – 25 September 2009.   Additional programs in FY 2010 may be offered based upon the level of enrollment and the success of the first program.

<DESC>Canada was the first country in North America to demonstrate that highly publicized occupant protection enforcement increases compliance with occupant protection laws.   North Carolina implemented a long-term program to increase seat belt use rates in 1994.  The program was named “Click It or Ticket,” and it was the first statewide-occupant protection selective traffic enforcement program (“STEP”) attempted in the United States.  In light of the success of the Click It or Ticket Mobilization, NHTSA applied the model to impaired driving, through its high visibility enforcement campaign.  Currently, 47 States are using the model to support the Click It or Ticket seat belt Mobilization and 33 States are using the model to support the impaired driving crackdown.

Increasing seat belt use from the current use rate to 90 percent would prevent an estimated 5,000 deaths, 130,000 injuries, and save society $8 billion annually.  To increase seat belt use nationally, NHTSA launched a national effort titled Buckle Up America (BUA) as the umbrella campaign for occupant protection.  BUA includes communications efforts such as Click It or Ticket and 4 Steps For Kids. 

BUA advocates four key elements to increase seat belt use:
o	Organizing strong partnerships
o	Generating visibility for Buckle Up America activities, specifically through strong enforcement messages in the media.
o	Passing primary belt laws and closing gaps in child passenger safety laws.
o	Supporting local law enforcement’s efforts to seek compliance with their state’s seat belt and child passenger safety laws, primarily through strong enforcement messaging, such as the Click It or Ticket campaign.
1.	
To support its efforts to reduce the level of impaired driving nationwide, NHTSA created a strong high visibility enforcement campaign.  This campaign supports a comprehensive impaired driving communications umbrella for states and communities to use in reaching the National goal of no more than 0.53 alcohol related deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2008.  The campaign targets high risk populations such as 21  to 34 year old males, high blood alcohol and repeat offenders, and underage drinkers, by increasing public education, expanding public and private partnerships, enacting strong legislation and promoting highly visible enforcement.



The enforcement efforts are only fully effective when the vast majority of the state’s citizens know that the intensified enforcement will be taking place and believe that they personally will be stopped, ticketed and fined (or arrested) if they are unbelted or impaired.  Therefore, the media campaigns deliver a single message – law enforcement is cracking down – in a convincing manner, through a variety of mediums to reach the target audience(s).

Region 8 has been working to increase seat belt use and to reduce impaired driving, but requires the technical assistance of an experienced communications and media consultant to “move the numbers.”  In addition, the Region 8 Office may be called upon to coordinate a Region-wide communications effort in response to a crisis, to develop regional communications tools, or to assist in working with the media to promote traffic safety priorities.

Public attention continues to be captured by issues other than the human and economic costs of motor vehicle crashes.  Despite the fact that seat belts are the most effective means of reducing these costs, nearly one quarter of the population fails to buckle up.  Crashes are the leading cause of death for children, youth and young adults.  The public and policy makers must be made aware of the human and economic costs of traffic crashes, and the simple steps that can be taken to ameliorate the problem.

The importance of seat belt use and sober driving must continue to be effectively communicated to target audiences, including those groups most at risk, the general public, and policy makers.  The effort to achieve a seat belt use rate of 90 percent will require a variety of communication strategies, including public information and education, PSA’s, paid advertising, and earned media in support of law enforcement activities.

 The purpose is to provide communication support for the NHTSA Region 8 and its States (Colorado, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) to support seat belt and impaired driving program efforts as well as other priority highway safety programs.  This long-term contract will be competitively bid which will ensure that the Region 8 will receive the advantages of continuity from the selected contractor in conducting necessary media support activities over the contract period and will also reduce costs on billable hours for learning-curve activities that take place on new contract start-ups.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />Solicitation No. BEA-RFQ-09-0000-IEA-FR-005 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).<br /><br />This notice and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.<br /><br />OVERVIEW<br /><br />BEA provides many economic measurements as part of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) of the United States. The NIPAs are the comprehensive set of accounts that measure the total value of final goods and services (gross domestic product, or GDP) produced by the U.S. economy and the total incomes earned in producing that output (gross domestic income or GDI). The NIPAs are used for a variety of purposes in setting national economic policy and in forecasting and interpreting macroeconomic activity.<br /><br />GDP, which is considered the most useful summary measure of the nation's production, measures final purchases by households, business, and government by summing consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. The NIPAs also include critical comprehensive measures of the nation's income, including GDI, corporate profits, and personal income. GDI measures total incomes earned by households by summing wages and salaries, rents, profits, interest, and other income.<br /><br />Travel and Tourism Satellite Account (TTSA) Program<br /><br />Travel and Tourism Satellite Accounts form an indispensable statistical instrument that allows the United States to measure the relative size and importance of the travel and tourism industry, along with its contribution to gross domestic product (GDP). Approved by the United Nations in March 2002 and endorsed by the U.N. Statistical Commission, TTSAs have become the international standard by which travel and tourism is measured. In fact, more than fifty countries around the world have embraced travel and tourism satellite accounting.<br /><br />The travel and tourism industry is an amalgam of various industries (e.g., traveler accommodations, food and beverage establishments, air transportation, et al). Therefore, no single North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code exists for travel and tourism in our national economic accounts, thereby making real credible, comprehensive, and comparable measurements virtually impossible.<br /><br />Based on, and an extension of, the U.S. Input-Output Accounts (I-O), the U.S. travel and tourism satellite accounts enable the Department of Commerce to accurately measure the aggregate travel and tourism industry. More importantly, TTSAs allow the Department to measure the travel and tourism industries' competitiveness relative to other U.S. industries, along with measuring the overall competitiveness of the United States relative to other countries.<br /><br />The Bureau of Economic Analysis, through funding provided by the Office of Travel and Tourism Industries, produces quarterly and annual TTSA data, both of which include:<br />&middot; Direct and indirect travel and tourism-related output<br />&middot; Direct and indirect travel and tourism-related employment<br />&middot; Total U.S. travel and tourism-related sales/expenditures<br />Additionally, annual Travel and Tourism Satellite Accounts data provide the industry with:<br />&middot; Output and employment data for twenty-six (26) individual industries<br />&middot; Value-added contribution of travel and tourism to the U.S. economy (GDP)<br />&middot; Supply of, and demand for, travel and tourism commodities<br />&middot; Disaggregated demand data of household, business, government, and nonresident demand for American travel and tourism-related goods and services<br />The travel and tourism industry recognizes the need for one consistent, comparable, and credible set of data highlighting the importance of one of America's largest employers.<br /><br />[END OF OVERVIEW]<br /><br /><br />DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES<br /><br />The Government is contemplating awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for commercial items for the purchase of data required to create the Travel and Tourism Satellite Accounts.<br /><br />I Scope<br /><br />The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) anticipates the award of a Sole Source contract to D.K. Shifflet &amp; Associates, Ltd with a base year and four additional option years.<br /><br />BEA has developed several satellite accounts designed to expand the analytical capabilities of the system of national accounts. Included among these is the Travel and Tourism Satellite Accounts (TTSA's), which is used to determine the economic size of the U.S. travel and tourism industry.<br /><br />DATE, TIME AND PLACE OFFERS ARE DUE<br /><br />Quotes are due by 2:00PM EST on Wednesday, June 17, 2009. All questions/inquiries must be submitted to the contract specialist via electronic mail (e-mail) not later than 2:00 PM EST on June 16, 2009. Inquiries submitted via telephone calls will be re-directed to an e-mail submission. Submit offers or any questions to the attention of Fermaint Rios at fermaint.rios@census.gov. Offerors who fail to complete and submit the requirements above may be considered non-responsive.<br /><br />The Government contemplates an award of a Firm Fixed Priced contract resulting from this solicitation.<br /><br />Offerors must be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov in order to be considered for award<br /><br /><br />THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS OF ONLY ONE SOURCE:<br /><br />DK Shifflet &amp; Associates, LTD<br /><br />The Government intends to award a noncompetitive contract under the provisions set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as authorized by 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).<br /><br />The lack of competition for this procurement action is due to the Bureau of Economic Analysis updating the TTSA&rsquo;s for calendar year 2008.&nbsp; BEA is seeking the exact same set of data that were supplied by D.K. Shifflet &amp; Associates, Ltd. (DKSA) to create the 1997-2006 TTSA&rsquo;s for calendar year 2007.&nbsp; The primary goal is to secure the best, most comprehensive data as appropriate inputs consistent with the data provided to BEA for the past seven years for the TTSA&rsquo;s.<br /><br />Continuity of data is crucial to accurately estimating the TTSA&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If D.K. Shifflet &amp; Associates, Ltd is not used as the sole source for this data purchase and this contract must be competed, BEA will require the data to be provided for eight years (1997-2008 inclusive).&nbsp; This is necessary in order to provide a completely consistent time series over the entire life of the TTSA&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The TTSA&rsquo;s are funded by the International Trade Administration (ITA) and requires that the TTSA estimates be a consistent, comparable time series from 1997-2008.<br /><br />Furthermore, use of another vendor to recreate the 1997-2008 time series would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition, and would create an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency&rsquo;s requirements.<br /><br />For these reasons, the Government knows of only one source capable of providing the required supplies at the desired level of quality.<br /><br />Submit all questions concerning this procurement by e-mail to <br /><br />fermaint.rios@census.gov.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Proposed prices will be compared to proposed cost of same or similar services in order to determine if the proposed prices are realistic, fair and reasonable.  Although price is not the determining factor for award, it may become the determining factor for award if two or more offers, after technical evaluations are completed, are determined to be technically equal.

<DESC>Title:
Scorecard and Internal Controls Document Search / Research Assistance

Description:
Provide Information and Documentation of Acquisition Management Leading Practices for Internal Scorecard Development, Internal Process Plan (IPP) Revision, and WO Review Process Update Project

Period of Performance:
Part A: July 1, 2009 through July 31, 2009
Part B: To Be Determined, at government’s option

Type of Task:
Part A: Fixed Price
Part B: Fixed Price

Proposal Due Date:
June 11, 2009

Index: 
Background:	1
Project:	1
Deliverables:	2
Government Resources:	3
Consultant Proposals:	3
Travel:	4

Background:  The USDA Forest Service (FS) Acquisition Management (AQM) staff is undertaking a 30-month change management program that consists of multiple projects.  Project goals include improving efficiency, accountability, and communications.   One of the projects includes the following tasks: (1) creation of a scorecard for evaluating agency AQM performance across operating units, to be followed by (2) revision of the agency Internal Process Plans (IPP) that AQM units at Regions and Stations follow and (3) an update of the existing Washington Office (WO) review processes used to ensure that IPPs and federal and agency policy are being followed.   The AQM function at the Forest Service includes procurement, purchase card management, emergency incident (e.g. fire, hurricane) procurement, grants and agreements, real property management (including quarters management and leasing), and personal property management.  The projects described above will cover all AQM functional areas.  It is the team’s intent to accomplish most of the work in-house.

Project:  Consultant support is requested to provide information on current government and private sector practices, with a focus on other federal agencies with similar AQM functions, for all three project tasks enumerated above.  Examples of information that the Forest Service requests includes:

•	Scorecards in place at other federal agencies for AQM function(s) (or the private sector equivalent to a scorecard / dashboard), including information on purpose / goals, frequency, and use from an internal controls perspective.  Describe how programs are tying their scorecard to the OMB Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), if applicable.

•	Internal Process Plans in place at other federal agencies for AQM function(s) (or the private sector equivalent), including information on success of IPPs in ensuring accountability, relationship of IPPs to an agency’s Internal Controls environment, and relationship of IPPs to OMB Circular A-123.


•	Documentation of effective internal (agency) reviews of AQM functions in accordance with IPPs (or the private sector equivalent), including internal review processes, teams, frequency of review and follow-up, and relationship of IPPs to review findings.

The FS recognizes that many best practices exist in the private sector.  However, these organizations do not operate in the same regulatory or structural environment in which government agencies do.  Therefore, the majority of resources provided by the consultant in response to this request should be from the public sector.  Public sector resources provided should be a mix of Department of Defense and federal civilian agencies with a preference toward similar land management agencies.  At least 1 example from a private sector organization with similar functions is also required.  

Deliverables:  
Part A:  Fixed Price.  The consultant deliverable will include documentation of at least four (4) examples of scorecards, IPPs, and internal AQM reviews that include the following AQM functional areas: procurement, grants and agreements, and property management (including real property management, personal property management, and leasing).  Therefore, at a minimum, twelve (12) documents are required.  If a document includes only procurement, for example, it would count towards the procurement total of 4 (the consultant would need to identify other documents to meet the requirements for the other functional areas).  At least 2 of the 4 examples must be from the federal government, and at least 1 must be from the private sector.  Documentation should be provided electronically, if possible, and should be submitted to the client as it is located (not in a single package at the end of the project).

The consultant will prepare a final deliverable in the form of a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, which shall include the following information: a concise description of documentation provided that includes a relative comparison of the documents by type and functional area(s) and identifies pros and cons associated with each agency’s approach.  Presentation should include analysis, findings and recommendations (as described in the “Project” section of this SOW).  

Consultant will be required to attend an in-person meeting for 1 day (location TBD) to share findings with the FS project team. 

Part B.  Fixed Price.  Additional analysis may be required based on findings and recommendations from Part A.  Deliverables for Part B are to be determined (TBD), if and when the government decides that additional consultant services are required.  

Government Resources:  Resources the FS will provide to the consultant upon award of the contract include existing Region and Station AQM IPPs and past WO review reports that provide an example of the current internal AQM review processes and documentation.  The FS does not currently have an AQM scorecard or performance metrics. 

Consultant Proposals:  The proposals shall be submitted to the designated Contracting Officer: cost and technical.  Consultant proposals will be evaluated based on cost, technical approach / methodology, and past performance.  Submission of proposals in electronic format is preferred.

Cost:  Offers for this project shall include Part A (required, firm fixed price).  Part B cost proposals should include labor rates only.  Travel costs will be reimbursed separately, and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) in effect at the time of travel.  See the travel section below for additional information.  Cost proposal need not include the estimated cost of travel for the proposed presenter of project findings (per deliverable section above).  
 
Technical Proposal:  The consultant should describe their planned approach / methodology for accomplishing the project, including describing any resources to which they have access that would result in a better final deliverable (e.g. knowledge databases, past client deliverables, etc).  Technical proposal should focus on Part A response.  Technical proposals must also include a section on past performance.   

•	Past Performance:  The successful consultant will have prior experience with developing scorecards, IPPs, and internal review plans for acquisition management organizations at other federal agencies.  Provide at least 3 summaries of past performance, including project reference contact information, in your response.  

Technical proposals should be no longer than 10 pages, single spaced, 12-point Arial font.  Proposals are due by the due date listed on the first page of this SOW, and should be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer listed below in the “Points of Contact” section.

Travel:  Any contractor travel required and funded by the Government in support of this contract shall be authorized by the COR in advance of the scheduled trip.  Travel costs will be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) in effect at the time of travel.

For each trip, the contractor will submit to the COR a Request for Travel Authorization (RTA).  The RTA will identify the purpose of the travel, an agenda for what is to be accomplished by the travel, and a detailed estimate of the costs to be incurred.  Unauthorized travel or travel not coordinated with the Forest Service COR may not be reimbursed.
Points of Contact:  
The Contracting Officer for this contract is Robert D. Jaeger (703-605-5307/twilks@fs.fed.us).
The Contracting Officer’s Representative for this contract is Bruce Hall, brucehall@fs.fed.us or (828) 257-4292.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address questions posed.
Q: Is an 8-port Hub connected to the Internet required (that they in turn will access with their own computer equipment and cables) or has the request for an Internet Cafe been withdrawn entirely?
A: We do still require an internet café. However, our only AV requirement is internet connectivity and an 8-port hub in the room. The IRS will provide laptops, cables and a printer for the room.  We need the AV provider to supply and service the connectivity and hub only.
Q: The equipment specifications note the need for (1) video switcher and (1) VGA switcher. Most professional video switchers have VGA i/o interfaces as well as Video signal i/o interfaces and would thus be able to provide the capabilities required for this project in a single unit. Were there specific reasons for listing the separate video and VGA switchers, or are we allowed to propose using 1 switcher to handle these requirements? 
A: One unit is fine as long as it has both capabilities.
Q: The equipment specifications note the need for (1) Sony D-35 Camera or Equivalent, and later note the need for (1) Camera for IMAG. Does this mean the government is requesting two (2) separate cameras be provided or just one (1)? If just one, should the Sony D-35 specification be the guideline for camera make and model? 
A: Just one camera is required. The Sony D-35 specification should serve as the guideline.
Q: The SOW states the Vendor must supply radios for the IRS on-site events team. How many radios will be required? 
A: Six radios please.

<DESC>Q: Who can I contact or who would have the info for the hotel specs. i.e. ballroom heights, dimensions, etc. 
A: This information is available on the hotel website.  (Hilton Lincoln Centre in Dallas TX)  contact information at the hotel will be provided to the successful vendor and the vendor will have an opportunity to conduct a site visit in August to refine this information.
Q: Are we able to rig in this hotel? 
A: No, hotel staff will do the rigging.
Q: Will we fly the equipment i.e. screens, projectors?
A: In the past we have had screen and projector on the floor.  We are open to another approach.
Q: Times for the general session days as well as times for the breakouts?
A: The meeting will run from 8-5 on Tuesday, Sept 22, from 8-4 on Wed Sept 23, and from 8-1 on Thursday, Sept 24th.  The Awards dinner will be from 6:00-9:00pm on Wed, Sept 23.  Exact times of general sessions vs. breakouts have not been determined.
Q:  Will the hotel be providing all the internet lines and will they bill for the services? 
A: The hotel will provide internet. It is the role of the AV vendor to make those arrangements with the hotel.  They will bill the IRS for these services as part of the contract.
Q: The Scope of Services C.3 1. mentions the need for easels, flipcharts and markers but this is not mentioned in the list of equipment needed for the Main auditorium or breakout rooms. Please let me know if we should provide pricing for these items and if so what quantity is needed. 
A: We will expect the hotel to provide these items.  Please do not include them in the AV proposal.
Q: Lighting- other than the Gobo, no lighting is listed.  In our experience lighting will be required for Video (IMAG) and we plan to include this in pricing unless the IRS says not to include.   
A: Please include lighting options if you feel it is important to the quality of the event.  Keep in mind that we are planning numerous interactive sessions with lots of communication between the audience and the people on the stage.  Lack of stage lighting is intentional as we are trying to avoid bright lights shining in the eyes of the presenters such that they are unable to easily see and interact with the audience.
Q: Video camera-We see this as a one camera shoot.  We see this as a straight ahead camera look that the client is looking for. Please let us know if this is not correct.
A: This is correct.
Q: We believe that the Internet/Phone for the Staff office and the Internet/Phone for the Internet Café is best secured from the hotel.  Do you have a contact person and contact information for us to speak directly to the hotel.  Can you provide this to us? 
A: We will provide hotel contact information to the successful vendor. Please indicate in your proposal that you expect these services to be provided by the hotel and do not price them in your bid.
Q:  We have identified the audio/lighting/video power requirements that would need to be ordered directly from the hotel.  Will the IRS pay for the power requirements as part of its contract with the hotel or should the estimated cost be identified as part of this audio visual services request?
A: Please identify the power requirements in your bid.  This cost will be paid to the hotel.
Q: Can you please clarify the statement under Section C.8 Proposal Requirements that states:
Pricing Model: Must provide pass-thru at no mark-up to client any associated costs of cross rental equipment they do not own or technical labor that is not on salaried staff and travel & trucking expenses?
A: We are fully aware the outside equipment and labor will be sourced outside the successful small business in order to meet the requirement of this bid, and we are not discouraging vendors from doing so.  We are only requiring that the successful AV vendor not mark-up the cost of such equipment or labor.
Q: Do you want 4-year old outdated worn equipment when better equipment is available through cross rental at the same price to you?  A company who owns their own equipment will attempt to maximize equipment shelf life at your risk.   
A: We expect the successful vendor to provide the equipment as specified in the bid.  
Q: Is owning the equipment a requirement?
A: No. Ownership is not a requirement.
Q: If an AV Production company can secure a team of freelancers that are known to be the best in the business would you prefer to limit a company only to use salaried employees? 
A: We expect the successful AV vendor to provide skilled AV technicians, whether they are salaried or freelance.
Q: Will the seating in the E, W, 8, 7, 6 room be Banquet Style for the entire event?  
A: The style of seating is likely to be half rounds for the general session and full rounds for the Awards dinner but this is still TBD.
Q: Will you have this room reserved and under security for the entire event?  Or does the AV get dismantled and reset at some point during the event? 
A: It will be secured.  No need to dismantle.
Q: Will there be a Stage Set?
A: We will be using risers to create a stage that is approximately 15x30.

<DESC>SB1341-09-RQ-0261 is hereby amended to address the following vendor questions/answers:

Question 1 - regarding section 1a for Coarse Motion Z-axis stage 
What is preferred range of travel of coarse z-axis motion stage?

Answer: The travel range of the coarse z-axis motion stage must be between 24 mm and 30 mm.
 
Question 2 - regarding section 4.1 for Piezoelectric Amplifiers
Is this application for high-dynamics application, thus requiring high-power output amplifier; or low/medium dynamics application requiring only low-power piezoelectric amplifier?

Answer: As defined in the specifications, the amplifiers must have bandwidth from DC to 250 Hz for XY and DC to 1 kHz for Z based on the
capacitances of the piezoelectric actuators. These are large signal specifications, meaning that they are for motion amplitudes that are greater than 70 % of the range. 

Question 3 - regarding section 4 for Fine motion control system
Other than supplied software control, what other software programs/packages should the controller be compatible with?
 
Answer: The supplied system software must have a command set for building motion control programs using LabView VIs and DLLs that are compatible with Matlab.  

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees, however, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested quoters may submit a quotation. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Multi Axis Precision Motion Stage System. Precision motion stages and their respective motion controllers are needed for a custom scanning probe
microscope. The system will consist of a fine motion stage that moves along the Z axis, a coarse motion stage that also moves along the Z axis, but with greater range and poorer resolution, and a fine motion stage that moves along the X and Y axes. When properly configured, the Z axis coarse and fine motion stages will move a probe along the Z axis while the XY motion stage will scan a sample along the X and Y axes, relative to the probe.

All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following line items:

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) each, Multi Axis Precision Motion Stage System which shall consist of the following components and meet or exceed the specifications as listed under each component:

(1) Coarse Motion Z Axis Stage:

<DESC>RECOVERY--Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for projects to explore the further development of efficient, high temperature SiC power electronics to be used in military vehicles that encompass hybrid electric mobility and power generation systems. The government desires SiC power electronics that can operate with coolant inlet temperatures at 100C or higher. Increased coolant temperatures increase cooling efficiency and allow for reduced cooling system size. The power electronics developed must use the SiC power semiconductors to maximize efficiency, power density (kW/liter) and specific power (kW/kg), while maintaining or improving power converter reliability. The corresponding reductions in size and weight for the cooling system and the electrical power converter, along with increased cooling efficiency and power conversion efficiency will make vehicle electric and hybrid electric power systems smaller, lighter and more fuel-efficient.<BR><BR>Estimated Maximum Government funding available for Topic #20 is $12.15M. The Government reserves the right to award part or all of an offerors proposal resulting in one or multiple contracts (for various amounts, but the sum of multiple contract awards shall not exceed $12.15M) that may address one or more or all of the Power Converter Types listed in the attachment at subparagraph 2.b of the Description section.<BR><BR>The topic was amended on 08 Jun 2009 to include footnotes to the Power Converter Types to provide additional details.<BR><BR>Potential offerors should access the full topic description by clicking the link below or copying and pasting the following URL:<BR><BR>http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/topics.htm <BR><BR>Solicitation terms and conditions and proposal submission instructions for this Broad Agency Anouncement can be accessed by copying and pasting the following URL:<BR><BR>http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/05RBAA1.htm<BR><BR>Special Proposal Instructions:<BR><BR>All proposals must be submitted by 3:00 PM EST on July 10, 2009 using the ASFI Bid Response System (BRS), which may be accessed at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA’s capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  OPS performs these functions through three teams, namely, Operations Support Team, Overseas Administration Team and Field Support Team.  The Operations Support Team provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue, Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, and Consequence Management.  It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA’s capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  The Operations Liaison Unit (OLU) is part of this team and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.

INTRODUCTION

The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/M) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of OLU.  These activities include military liaison and coordination, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployment, Response Management Team (RMT) participation and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.

•	Assist OFDA management in defining a strategy for military coordination which will include guidelines for determining OFDA participation in DoD operations when specific requests are made and where OFDA should request activities and participation;
•	Determine whether OFDA participation in DoD humanitarian activities is necessary and useful;
•	Provide OFDA briefings and training to uniformed military officers at various DoD educational institutions (War Colleges, National Defense University, Navy Postgraduate School, etc.);
•	Coordinate with DoD and the Department of State’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to provide OFDA staff with briefings on military procedures, assets, roles, capabilities, culture, chain-of-command and humanitarian-related activities and circulate status reports which summarize DoD activities in which OFDA personnel are involved;
•	Deploy with DoD forces in humanitarian emergencies;
•	Provide reports, debriefs and evaluations to the OLU Team Leader and other appropriate OFDA staff of all planning, exercises and deployments;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p>Contracting Office Address</p>
<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AAC - Air Armament Center, 691st ARSS, 207 West D Avenue, Suite 622, Building 349, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6008</p>
<p>Description</p>
</p>
<p>The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 728th Armament Systems Group, 691st Armament Systems Squadron, Contracting Office, Eglin AFB FL is planning to procure spare components in support of the BQM-167 Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) program in 4th quarter FY09. AFSATs are used by the 53d Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG) to test and evaluate air-to-air and surface-to-air weapon systems. The Air Force currently procures the BQM-167A target, produced by Composite Engineering Inc. (CEi), to meet this need. The Government does not own a technical data package for the BQM-167A target system and its peculiar support equipment and therefore cannot provide this data to interested parties. Multiple contract actions are anticipated in order to ensure no break in service for the Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) program. The first action will be to award a modification to existing contract No. FA8675-07-C-0280. This modification is projected to be awarded in 4th quarter FY09 and will include spares for sustainment of Lots 1-5. The second action will be to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in FY10 that will extend through FY15, and issue delivery orders on a quarterly basis to meet ongoing spares requirements.</p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;Schedule is critical for the procurement and delivery of spares, and any potential source must be able to deliver these items within the required timeframe to meet critical mission requirements. Potential sources must be capable of providing all the spare items required (~400 unique items in total), not a subset. Spare components to be procured include, but are not limited, to the following:<br />CEi P/N DESCRIPTION LEAD TIME<br />1C700-107 Structural Assy, Electronics Bay Cover 7 mos<br />1F200-101 Structural Assy, Empennage 7 mos<br />1F341-101 Sequencer, ALE-47 (Modified) 7 mos<br />1L301-101 Canopy, Drogue Assembly 7 mos<br />1L307-101 Canopy, Main Assembly 7 mos<br />1E420-9 SENSOR_VDOPS_ENCRYPTION_ESP 7 mos<br />1C220-101 Structural Assy, Fuselage 8 mos<br />1C300-101 Assy, Empennage 8 mos<br />1E455-1 Autopilot Sensor 8 mos<br />1C600-101 Assy,Outboard Wing,RH 9 mos<br />1C600-102 Assy,Outboard Wing,LH 9 mos<br />1E474-101 Electrical Assy, Power Conditioning Unit 10 mos<br />1E460-1 Transponder, GRDCS 11 mos<br />1E480-1 Transponder, L-Band (IFF) 11 mos<br />1E470-3 Integrated Flight Controller 11 mos<br />1C400-501 Engine, TRI60-5+ 12 mos<br />1J001-3 Engine Control Unit 12 mos<br />Potential offerors who are capable of meeting the Air Force's spare requirements and delivery schedules outlined above are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC).

From this page choose which of the three options fit with your company and then click on the "Continue" link.  Now you are shown a page which has two text boxes for your CCR Username and Password.

<ARCHDATE>06122009
<DESC>Justification was provided to support a task award under MD578ATC1T5 for other than full and open competition.  This justification was approved and a task was issued on a sole source basis using Millennia Lite FA3, to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).  SAIC will  support the procurement, installation, integration and test of  Deployable TACANs (D-TACAN) at Camp Bucca, Iraq; Baghdad International Airport (BIAP), Iraq; Q-West AB, Iraq; Ali AB, Iraq; Kirkuk AB, Iraq; Kabul, Afghanistan; Manas International Airport, Kirkistan and Langley AFB, VA. and one (1) VORTAC at Bagram AB, Afghanistan. Procure, install, integrate and test Remote Maintenance Upgrades (RMUs) to the NAVAIDS installed at Balad AB, Iraq, Al Udeid AB, Qatar and Bagram AB, Afghanistan.  This contract is T&M labor with FFP materials.

The additional work that is the subject of this amended OTFO follows. The COR’s rough estimate and the rationale for adding the work is included in each Work Order description.

WO#8 - Remote Refueling Kit.  Estimated price $65,493.   During OT&E it was found the
generators would not sustain the D-TACAN for more than 6 hours without
refueling.  In remote sites it is not possible to refuel the generators by
removal or other normal methods.  The solution is to provide each D-TACAN
with a remote refueling kit which will negate the requirement to remove or
use other means to refuel.  Service to air traffic will not have to be
terminated.  Flight Safety will not be jeopardized.  This was not specifically called out in the SOW because it was not known until the system was tested.

WO#9 - Dial Radios.  Estimated price $47,471.  During OT&E it was noted that dial
(flight check) radios must be with each D-TACAN.  The requirement did not
call this out as it was believed radios would not be needed to be with each
D-TCAN 100% of the time; sharing of radios would be possible.  Due to remote
locations, changing of conditions/terrain/locations these radios are
required to be with each D-TACAN in order to meet immediate requirement to
perform standard flight checks, special flight checks and flyability flight
checks. SOW para 4 addresses remote flight check.  As stated above it was
thought the radios for the D-TACANs could be shared but during test it was
found this would negatively impact flight safety.

An identification of the statutory authority:

The statutory reference authorizing this action is Reference 10 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2), when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.
