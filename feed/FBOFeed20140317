<p>TITLE: Aerial Layer Communications</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA RIK-14-06</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory - Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this BAA for research, design, development, concept testing, evaluation and experimentation of technologies/techniques for airborne networking and the development and demonstration of mid-altitude aerial layer communication technologies and concepts.</p>
<p>The characteristics of today's aerial layer networks are limiting our combat effectiveness, especially in contested, degraded, operationally limited (CDO), and anti-access area denial (A2/AD) environments where studies have shown that we may be unable to maintain communication availability, and will be outnumbered/outgunned if the status-quo is maintained.</p>
<p>Major challenges include the transformation of the attributes of today's networks to the attributes of the desired network as shown below, while maintaining interoperability.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Today's Network Attributes</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desired Network Attributes</span> <br /></strong>Platform- and link-centric&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Network-of-networks centric<br /><br />Self-contained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open<br /><br />Preplanned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flexible and Ad Hoc<br /><br />Contains components designed for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contains components designed for <br />&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">wired</span> and/or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">static</span> applications&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wireless</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dynamic</span> applications<br /><br />Demos done on specific platforms <br />requiring modification&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demos performed on PODs</p>
<p>In addition, adequate capabilities for airborne network management are lacking today and there is a need in the community for solutions to manage and plan both today's multi-information link based airborne network environment and tomorrow's heterogeneous based architectures. Furthermore, a lack of dexterous network management and recovery mechanisms makes it hard to provide the necessary level of network reliability and survivability at the battlefield. This is nowhere more factual than in A2/AD environments where the ability to make rapid adaptations based on the situation is crucial.</p>
<p>This BAA seeks white papers that have a goal to improve the network, and cause the network to become a force multiplier. A force multiplier is a capability that, when added to and employed by a combat force, significantly increases the combat potential of that force and thus enhances the probability of successful mission accomplishment. Example areas of interest are:</p>
<p>1. Secure, Dynamic, ad-Hoc, Adaptable, and Programmable Aerial Mesh Networks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Routers and Security Devices<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Software Defined Networking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Reconfigurable Protocols for Self-healing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Network Coding<br />2. Network Resource Management<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Joint Network Situational Awareness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Integrated Network Operations<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Deliberate, Pre-mission, and Crisis Planning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Machine-to-machine C2 Interfaces<br />3. Modularized/Open Architecture Information Links/Networks/System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. AntTx/Rx Module<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Waveform Module<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Network Module<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Security Module<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Information Management Module<br />4. IP Communication Networking<br />5. Distribution and Range Extension <br />6. High Capacity Backbone<br />7. Network Enabled Weapons Information Links/Network<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Airborne Connectivity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Modularized/Open Architecture<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Cooperative Control<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. CONOPS<br />8. Command and Control of Directional Networking</p>

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</strong></p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.

Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section IV, Paragraph 6 of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations.

You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your Proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>

<DESC>Planned work is for hazard fuels reduction on the Beartooth Ranger District of the Custer National Forest. The 2014 Horseman Flats/Benbow Hazardous Fuels Reduction Project is a continuation of the ranger district's hazard fuels program. The Horseman Flats units are located west of Nye, Montana and North West of the Stillwater Mine Complex. The Benbow units are west of Red Lodge, Montana and southwest of Dean, Montana. The purpose of this project is to provide wildfire management more suppression options to reduce the possibility of future wildfires from spreading beyond National Forest System lands. This project is intended to reduce hazardous fuel loading, thin mixed coniferous stands, and provide long-term effectiveness of fuels treatments by reducing fire intensities. Total acres to be treated under all items is 188.6 acres.<br /><br />This is a mechanical (tracked or wheel) operation: can be feller buncher and/or excavator and/or forwarder and/or skidder. Contractor can cut trees and slash with hand chainsaw if preferred but machines are needed to skid logs, deck logs and pile slash.
<p>The project is located on the Beartooth Ranger District on the Custer National Forest. Horseman Flats units are located near Nye, MT: T5S, R15E, portions of sections 7,8,9,10,15,16, 21 and FS Road 2848.</p>
<p>Benbow units are approximately 25 miles west of Red Lodge, MT and 2-3 miles southwest of Dean, MT: T5S, R16E, Sections 15, 16, 21, 22.<br /><br />It is anticipated the solicitation and all materials will be posted to FBO by 3/31/14.</p>

<DESC>Z- Coalpit-Pole Trail Construction and Reconditioning<br />&nbsp;<strong>Project Location and Directions</strong>. The project is located in the Tobacco Root Mountains and is a popular bike trail system for both mountain bikes and dirt bikes. The project is expected to open up in early June or perhaps in mid-May. Work can begin as soon as the site is dry. This trail system is rocky. There is rock excavation as a pay item, bid appropriately.&nbsp; Access to the Mill Creek Trailhead (the beginning of the Coalpit Trail) is from Waterloo. Take the Whitehall Exit off I-90 and travel South on Hwy 55. After approximately 8 miles turn left onto a County Road with a sign "Waterloo" and cross Parsons Bridge. Travel approximately 2 miles and turn left towards the mountains. Continue on this road until you see a sign that says "Mill Creek Trailhead 4 Miles". Turn left onto this road and continue to the trailhead. High clearance vehicle is not required.&nbsp; Access to the Pole Canyon Trailhead may require a high clearance vehicle. To get to the Pole Canyon Trailhead, take the Cardwell Exit off I-90 and travel South on County Hwy 359 for approximately 4 miles. Turn right onto the Boulder River Road (signed). Travel approximately 7 miles to the junction with the Brownback Road. Take this road almost a mile and turn right. This road is roughly 3 miles and may be snowed in sooner than the Mill Creek Trailhead. At the end of the road is the Pole Canyon Trailhead<br /><strong>&nbsp;<br />Description of Work.</strong> The project consists of constructing four miles of new trails, and reconditioning over four miles of existing trail. Construction items include clearing and grubbing, turns, rock excavation, drainage structures, barriers, sign and bulletin board installation, stake refreshing and cleanup, and other miscellaneous trail construction items. The two turns on Pyramid Trail No. 7163 may not allow mini-excavator access. Contractor choice. The trail might be too narrow to safely negotiate the trail without reconstruction, however reconstruction is not a part of this contract, only reworking of the switchbacks is,quote appropriately.<br /><br /><strong>Site Visit.</strong> No formal site visit is planned but it is highly recommended bidders visit the site. The trail is rocky in spots and will require rock excavation. Please contact Kendra Bull, 406.683.3962 for more information.
<p><strong>Price Range. Between</strong> $25,000-150,000. <br /><strong>Start Work</strong>. It is estimated that the Notice to Proceed will be issued by&nbsp;June 1, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance.</strong> Contract shall be completed by&nbsp;July 30, 2015.</p>

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service intends to establish a number of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) with vendors interested in supplying Off-Highway Vehicles (OHV's) to include All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV's), Utility Task Vehicles (UTV's), Snowmobiles, Motorcycles, and other similar equipment. The BPA's will be used to fill OHV orders for the Forest Service on a national basis, and may be utilized by other designated Federal Agencies. While vendors will be able to select from a number of regions to cover, they should expect to deliver to a large geographic area and potentially quote and accept used equipment trade-ins as part of the ordering process.
<p><br />The solicitation used to establish the initial group of BPA holders will be issued via this web site on or about March 31, 2014. The solicitation will be set-aside 100% for small businesses. The applicable NAICS is 441228 with a corresponding size standard of $30.0 million. The initial solicitation will result in a limited number of awards intended to meet short term needs while providing adequate geographic coverage. The number of BPA holders may be adjusted over time to ensure there is sufficient coverage for the purchases being made.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government. In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award of a BPA. Lack of registration in SAM on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on the registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.sam.gov//.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to issue a Purchase Order to J.F. Taylor, Inc. (JFTI), on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)[c]ontracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  This contemplated effort may result in the issuance of a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order to satisfy requirements to provide Spares of the Weapons Control Panels used in support of the Aircraft Operating Program (AOP) 87.4 upgrade to the MH-60 Sierra Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) #1, #3-9, and Weapons Tactical Trainer (WTT) #1-5.  JFTI is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the Weapons Control Panels.
  JFTI is a subcontractor to CAE, the prime contractor responsible for implementing the AOP 87.4 effort.  While these Spares fall within the scope of the original contract, the delivery of the spares was quoted as 9 months which would be after that contract expires. 

As the OEM, JFTI is deemed the only source available  as award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. 

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. This notice of intent is for information purposes only.

<DESC>NAICS:  237990 <br> SIC:  1629 <br> Size Standard:  $20M <br>  <br> This synopsis is for the Jones Oyster Bed Island Dredge Material Containment Area (DMCA) Raising and Improvements, Savannah Harbor project.  This acquisition is being offered as a competitive 8(a) Set Aside and will result in a Fixed Price Contract Award.  The construction magnitude for this project ranges from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000.   <br>    <br> Description of Work:  This project includes raising the front perimeter dike of the Jones Oysterbed Island Dredge Material Containment Area (DMCA) approximately two feet; with the option to construct a bird island.

The dike construction will be performed to the inside of the existing dike crest and slope, except in areas where the existing dike has washed away due to erosion.  Approximately 500 to 1000 linear feet of shoreline will be protected from river erosion by using a stone revetment.  The project will include an option to construct one eight-acre bird island with a perimeter moat and containment dike to allow water to permanently surround the island.  An equipment access and landing site shall be necessary since the island may only be accessed by water.  A dike access ramp from the landing site will be included in the project.

<DESC>The synopsis is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ) or proposals (RFP). This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.  Summary of Work: The salient characteristics of the products must meet specifications. <br>  <br> McNary Lock & Dam (MNA) relies on potable water to operate its main unit generators. A 400,000 gallon tank is located on the hill above McNary Dam. Well house pumps are used to maintain the water level and pressure to supply the project.  The town site Pump House is currently being used for chlorinating the potable water supplied to the McNary machine shop, warehouses and powerhouse. This water is used for gland systems in addition to potable water.  The town site has a dedicated transformer bank to supply power. The construction of the new McNary Dam Potable Water System, adding a 60A breaker for the future load, could impact the existing design load of the town site house. It's recommended to increase the capacity of the transformer bank. <br>  <br> It's the intent of the USACE to procure a new system for sectionalizing, tapping or terminating underground cable and a new 225KVA transformer for the substation to feed the town site house load and the existing 208V /120V, three phase load from well house #2. <br>  <br> THREE PHASE PAD MOUNTED TRANSFORMER <br>  <br> The transformer high-voltage compartment shall contain the incoming line, transformer high-voltage bushings, load-break switch handle(s), and access to oil-immersed bayonet fuses; tap changer handle, insulated phase barriers, and ground pad. <br>  <br> The transformer shall be radial-feed oil-immersed type rated at 15 kv, 95 kv BIL, with a continuous current rating and load-break rating of 200 Amperes, and a make-and-latch rating of 12,000 rms amperes symmetrical. The switch handle shall be located in the high-voltage compartment. Audible sounds level shall not exceed a maxim of 55 decibels, and transformer efficiency 99.17percent. <br>  <br> Transformer Test Reports <br>  <br>  Routine and other tests shall be performed in accordance with IEEE C57.12.90 by the manufacturer on the actual transformer to be supplied. Contractor shall submit test reports containing results of the below required tests and receive Government approval prior to delivering equipment to the project site. <br>  <br> THREE PHASE SECTIONALIZING CABINET SPECIFICATIONS <br>  <br> The contractor shall supply a three phase sectionalizing cabinet. <br>  <br> PORCELAIN FUSE CUTOUT, 100A, 15KV CLASS <br>  <br> The contractor shall supply a three (3) cutout fuse, 15KV, 100A, BIL 110kv. <br>  <br> The RFQ number W912EF14Q0095 will be issued on or about March 18, 2014 but may be issued prior to or after March 18, 2014.  The quote closing due date and time will be detailed in the RFQ and any amendments that may be issued.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to conduct market research to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for the procurement of a Logic Analyzer for the Edwards Air Force Test Center (AFTC) and to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response.
<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334515 "Instrument Manufacturing for Measuring and Testing Electricity and Electrical Signals" which has a corresponding Size standard of 500 employees. The Air Force anticipates a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:<br />See attached:</p>
<p>All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their SAM. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties who believe they can meet the requirement are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the supplies as requested above. Please include the following:<br />Vendor's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and email address;<br />Vendor's business size status (small or large business);<br />A description of vendor's ability to provide the supply as described above; including shipping method and timeframe.<br />Response to this notice must be submitted to Chuck McKinley via email: charles.mckinley.2@us.af.mil not later than 1600 PST on Friday, 1 Apr 2014.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>

<p>Firms responding by the closing date will be evaluated according to the criteria set out below and ranked in order of preference for each contract.</p>
<p>(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services. (20 points). The Surveyor must be a licensed registered land surveyor in the State of New Jersey. Evaluation will include the level of formal education, continuing education, the number of years licensed, and involvement in professional activities/organizations.</p>

If the apparent successful offeror fails to negotiate an acceptable FPRA with the Contracting Officer, it will be ineligible for award.</p>
<p>The CO will commence negotiations with the top-ranked firm. If a contract cannot be successfully negotiated, the CO will begin negotiations with the next-ranked firm and will proceed in this manner until a satisfactory contract is negotiated. The CO will not award any contract unless he/she determines that the negotiated rates are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract.

Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.

<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 31, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>

<DESC>Grade 4-12 Reading Intervention Program<br />76 -- Read 180 New Generation (NG)<br /><br />Description(s): <br />The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Education Division intends to procure READ 180 New Generation (NG) using a Firm-Fixed Requirement Type contract on a sole source basis with Scholastic Inc., 557 Broadway, New York City, NY 10012-3999, under the authority of FAR 6.302.
<p>READ 180 NG is being procured because DoDEA in 2006 has adopted Scholastic Inc.'s READ 180 Enterprise Edition (EE) programs as its reading intervention program and installed READ 180 EE licenses throughout the agency. These licenses provided DoDEA's struggling readers access to READ 180 EE software, Scholastic Reading Counts and the Scholastic Reading Inventory in perpetuity. The READ 180 EE software needs to be updated.

Assess behavior, psychological, social, and cultural norms of multiple countries, i.e., U.S., Middle Eastern, North African, and Far East persons in differing environments through communication patterns in social media.  Factors associated with social media deception are not well understood especially within culturally diverse groups:  How is social media organized for deception and influence?   What are some of the contributing factors to social media deception behavior and what are the quantitative and qualitative tools and techniques used to track those factors?  What deception techniques are most effective in social media and can they be used to detect specific persons?  Is there any real data to validate specific deception techniques within multiple cultural environments?  What are the gender and age issues in social media deception?  It is important to get away from Western ideas of sociological and psychological theorem and patterns and conduct a greater research effort in analysis of these areas within specific culturally diverse populations. Obtaining information from data collection agencies, and from education professionals, sociologists and psychologists from specific cultures would be most beneficial.  The RFI results will be used to provide a greater understanding of deception and detection capabilities and determining quantifiable techniques and validating data from multiple perspectives.   This is a research initiative.  Specific information sought includes:  Lists of documents pertaining to the research queries stated previously: professional papers, journals, books, etc.  If documents can be acquired without purchase, request those items be emailed to Ms. Terresa Jackson according to Submittal requirements stated below.  Data base systems information with points of contact for accesses, if necessary.  If corporate or government agency, need information on the company including name, URL, mailing address, email and phone.  Simulation environments software or online URLs with points of contact for accesses, if necessary.  Brief description of system's features, capabilities, performance, and availability.  Technology Readiness Level (TRL) with a brief description of system state of readiness or availability. This should include statements on demonstrated or evaluated performance.  Cost information on those items that require purchase such as licensing, price and General Services Administration (GSA) schedule information if available.  Submittals: A NOTE REGARDING THIS RFI:  This RFI is for information gathering and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer.

Contractors are encouraged to complete SAM registration as soon as possible; the government may not delay award for the purpose of allowing a contractor time to register in SAM. <br> If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br> Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel- Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil <br>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>Background<br />The FDA/NCTR/DGMT uses TK6 and WTK1 cells in several mutagenicity assays. However, it is unclear how the genetic background of these cells compares to a normal human transcriptome and genome-information crucial to assess the validity of the findings obtained from these cells. To better understand the genetic background of TK6 and WTKl cells, DGMT seeks to sequence their transcriptome and whole genome. To that end, DGMT needs a massively parallel sequencing platform that can rapidly and affordably sequence and analyze entire human transcriptomes and genomes. DGMT also routinely employs the Pig-a assay for in vivo mutagenicity studies. A massively parallel sequencing platform will allow DGMT to rapidly and affordably identify mutations in the Pig-a gene in lymphocytes, erythroid precursors, and other blood cell progenitors-in complex mixtures and without need of clonal expansion. Such findings and capabilities will greatly enhance the value of the Pig-a assay.</p>
<p>Requirement<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology (DGMT), is soliciting quotes for a Next Generation Sequencer System plus post-warranty Preventative Maintenance (PM) Services.</p>

<p>Post-Warranty Service Maintenance Agreement<br />Post-Warranty Service Maintenance Agreement(s) to begin upon expiration of initial warranty. The Government is interested in acquiring PM services for up to an additional four (4) one-year option periods that the Government may exercise unilaterally on an annual basis.</p>

<p>Solicitation provisions</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.</p>
<p>Addendum Paragraph (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror shall state on its quote that the quoted prices in its offer firm until September 30, 2014.</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable to this solicitation. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (1) of that provision are as follows:</p>
<p>The government will award a purchase order to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government on a best value (tradeoff) evaluation basis, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical Capability of the instrumentation/services offered to meet the Government's requirement.<br />(ii) Price.</p>
<p>When combined, Technical Capability is more important when compared to price in determining the best value to the government; however, price remains a significant factor.</p>
<p>Technical Capability will be determined by:<br />&bull; The degree to which the proposed instrument meets or exceeds the requirements of the SOW and the associated value of any additional benefits that may be derived in cases where the proposed instrument exceeds the minimum requirements. <br />&bull; The degree to which the proposed PM services plan meets or exceeds the minimum performance requirements and the value associated with any additional benefits that may be derived where the offered plan exceeds the minimum requirements. <br />&bull; A review of the Offeror's certification/training program for their technicians.</p>
<p>The technical requirements as indicated above are minimal requirements only; offerors may offer additional instrumentation/services as part of their quote that exceeds these requirements. The offeror shall note any additional instrumentation/services that are being offered in excess of the minimum requirements and shall provide a detailed explanation as to what the additional instrumentation/services are and how they will be of benefit to the Government.</p>
<p>The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal. To ensure information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the service meets the technical requirements. Quotes shall include technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information corresponding to each minimum required item, which demonstrates the capabilities of the offeror.</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>Price proposed must be detailed and represent the offeror's response to the schedule of items above.</p>
<p>The cost of operating the equipment is a significant component of the price evaluation. Operating costs are primarily driven by the cost per kit required to sequence an entire human genome in a single run with a depth equal to 30x. Sequencing kits are not part of this requirement. However, offerers must provide detailed information regarding which kit(s) they recommend be used to perform this type of run on their proposed instrument. This information will assist the Government in determining the operating cost of the instrument which will be used as part of the total price analysis.</p>
<p>Options: The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes on a total price basis. Total price shall consist of the price of the instrument + estimated operational costs for the base + 4 option year period + the price for PM services during the option years. Operational costs are comprised of the cost per kit x 25 (the Government's expected number of runs per year).</p>
<p>The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p><br />The Provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of the provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/#1. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (o) of this provision.</p>
<p>This solicitation is being issued under the premise that the offeror will certify that the combination of equipment maintenance/service it will propose to fulfill this requirement is exempt from the Service Contract Act per the conditions set forth in FAR 52.222-48 &amp; FAR 22.1003-4(c). If the Contractor certifies that the company is exempt under the terms and conditions of 52.222-48, then clause 52.222-51 will be applicable to the resulting order. In the event that a contractor does not make this certification, the traditional Service Contract Act clauses 52.222-41, and 52.222-43 shall be included in the resulting order award as well as Wage Determination WD 05-2035 (Rev.-14) http://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/05-2035.txt?v=14</p>
<p>FAR CLAUSE 52.222-48 EXEMPTION FROM APPLICATION OF THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT TO CONTRACTS FOR MAINTENANCE, CALLIBRATION, OR REPAIR OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT CERTIFICATION <br />(a) The offeror shall check the following certification: <br />CERTIFICATION<br />The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that- <br />(1) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Government purposes, and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontractor) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(2) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of equipment. <br />(i) An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. <br />(ii) An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror; and <br />(3) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract are the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(c)(3) that the Service Contract Act- <br />(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or <br />(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis. <br />(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision- <br />(1) The clause in this solicitation at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror; and <br />(2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible, if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation. <br />(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.</p>
<p>It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the internet site for the release of an amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation (if any).</p>

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

	
	
	
	
	
    (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]

    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
    [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that-

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

B.5  STATEMENT OF WORK
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION:  The Southern Arizona Veterans Administration Health Care System (SAVAHCS) mission is to provide quality healthcare to veterans in an environment of compassion, education, and research.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) long-term care includes a continuum of services for the delivery of care to veterans needing assistance due to chronic illness, physical disability, or end of life care.  Assistance takes many forms and is provided in varied settings, including non-institutional care in home or community-based settings.  In the past, VHA furnished home care services to a limited number of veterans.  Today, all enrolled veterans are eligible for a comprehensive array of medically necessary in-home services as identified in VA's medical benefits package (see Title 38 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 17.38(a) (1)(ix)). These services are an increasingly important component of VHA's integrated health care delivery system.  VHA purchases skilled and unskilled services to enhance or build a comprehensive array of resources necessary to address the short term or long term care needs of enrolled veterans.

2.0 SCOPE OF WORK:  The Contractor shall provide all Home Health Care Services as described herein when an enrolled/eligible veteran is unable to receive care at the SAVAHCS, for the areas for which they are awarded a contract.  The types of Home Health Care Services to be provided under this contract are defined as follows:

2.1 Skilled Registered Nursing Services are required by the SAVAHCS to provide a broad range of skilled home nursing care that allows the veteran to remain living at home.  Skilled registered nursing services may include, but are not limited to, skilled observation and assessment, data collection, formulation of treatment plans, teaching and technical procedures.

2.2 Licensed Practical Nursing Services in the home are required by the SAVAHCS to assist veterans with a wide range of technical nursing duties including, but not limited to, dressing changes, medication set-ups and ostomy care that will permit the veteran to remain at home.

2.3 Homemaker Services are required by the SAVAHCS to assist veterans with light housekeeping duties in order for the veteran to remain as independent as possible in their place of residence and delay/avoid placement in a long term care facility.  Homemaker services may include, light housekeeping, laundry, meal preparation, grocery shopping, escorting the patient to appointments, assuring patient safety, and other services that are consistent with the homemaker's level of responsibility and the patient's care plan.

2.4 Home Health Aide Services are required by the SAVAHCS to assist veterans with personal care duties in order for the veteran to remain as independent as possible in their place of residence and delay/avoid placement in a long term care facility.  Home Health Aide services may include bathing, grooming, personal hygiene, transferring, dressing, eating, and other services that are consistent with the home health aide's level of responsibility and the patient's care plan.  

2.5 Respite Care Services are required by the SAVAHCS to assist veterans and their unpaid caregivers with the opportunity to remain as independent as possible in their place of residence and delay/avoid placement in a long term care facility.  Respite services may be provided by skilled or unskilled workers as appropriate for the individual veteran.   Respite services are provided to allow the veteran's unpaid caregiver the opportunity for relief from care giving responsibilities.

2.6 Hospice Care Services are required by the SAVAHCS to provide the final stage of palliative care in which the primary goal of treatment is comfort rather than cure for patients with advanced disease that is life-limiting and refractory to disease-modifying treatment.  Hospice services are provided by a team of professionals, emphasizing relief of suffering and maintenance of functional capacity as long as possible through comprehensive management of the physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of the patient.  These services also provide support for the families or other caregivers, including bereavement support following the death of the patient.

	2.6.1 Home Hospice Services may include, but are not limited to the following:
		
		2.6.1.1 Chaplain Service to provide care to terminally ill veterans and their 				families that include spiritual support, emotional support, pastoral care, 					bereavement counseling, and assist with memorial services and funeral 					arrangements.

<p>Through the preservation and modernization of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation's most talented designers and engineers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 to 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering (A/E) design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals and security requirements.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>The Theodore Levin Courthouse (Levin) is located at 231 West Lafayette Blvd., Detroit, Michigan. It is a 1934 Neo-Classical Revival style building that has a structural steel frame superstructure with a smooth-cut Indiana limestone facade. It has ten stories above grade with a pair of two-story penthouses on top and a basement one level below grade. The central core of the building opens to form a light court from the third through tenth floors. The majority of the existing building systems are either original or were installed 30 to 50 years ago. Due to the age of these systems, repairs are becoming more frequent and finding replacement parts is becoming more difficult and costly. If the existing systems are not replaced within the building soon, a catastrophic event could occur that could put tenants at risk or not allow for an agency to accomplish their mission within their current space.</p>
<p>This project will replace/modernize all major building systems including: HVAC, fire and life safety, electrical, plumbing and elevators.  Interior alterations include improvements to the Judge and Prisoner secure circulation, exit stairs, the loading dock, Judge's parking, creation of swing space and the construction of a new elevator/stair tower in the light court.  The design will follow the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Building Preservations Plan (BPP) guidance, respecting the existing historic character of the building while updating the infrastructure to meet the needs of today's modern workforce. GSA anticipates using a CMc delivery method for construction of this design.<br /><br /><strong>SCOPE OF WORK<br /></strong><br />The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural,  engineering, historic preservation, interior design, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), and post-construction contract services (PCCS) for the modernization of this 80 year old courthouse. The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings) and customer agency requirements.</p>
<p>The project will be designed in one phase (entire scope) but the construction may be accomplished in up to three phases requiring the A/E to package the design documents into separate construction projects.</p>
<p>This building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property to a historic district. Each design submission must be approved by the Regional Historic Preservation Officer, who will coordinate external review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in compliance with the Nation Historic Preservation Act, Section 106. Design submissions will include a preservation report with captioned photographs and relevant design details identifying preservation design issues and solutions as they are developed. Every effort will be made to avoid adversely effecting original materials and design in the buildings restoration of preservation zones identified in the Building Preservation Plan. Alteration of character defining features would require consultation and agreement on solutions with GSA preservation staff and SHPO.<br /> <br /><strong>SELECTION PROCESS<br /></strong><br />This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E firms/lead designers interested in contracting for this work.

<p>USCG ALC<br />1664 Weeksville Road<br />SRR Hangar 75, HSCG38-14-Q-200083<br />Attn: Terrie L. Pickard<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS HSCG38-14-Q-200083</p>
<p>The following clauses and provisions are included:</p>
<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items Jul 2013</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria<br />This purchase order is expected to be awarded on a competitive basis. Quotes will be evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-2 based on the criteria listed below. Award will be made to the offeror representing the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability: Technical Acceptability will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a certificate of conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. Part 21 of the Federal Aviation Regulation outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the requirements is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote.</p>
<p>Price: The contractor shall provide pricing as requested in the attached spreadsheet titled "HSCG38-14-Q-200083 - Requirements". Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section. The offeror's quotation will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 13.106-3, in order to determine if it is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Delivery: The USCG requires delivery of all items by 04 August 2014. Offerors that can meet the Government's required delivery date will be rated higher than offerors that are unable to deliver on time. Offerors that can deliver sooner than the Government's required delivery date will be rated the highest for this factor.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government may use information available from past contracts/purchase orders with the USCG, delivery information found in the USCG's AMMIS system, and any information found using sources such as Federal Government sources, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)/Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). Offerors are advised that more recent performance is more relevant than less recent performance and will be given greater weight in the evaluation process. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating.</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items Nov 2013 <br />X Alternate I of 52.212-3. Apr 2011</p>
<p>An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via https://www.acquisition.gov .

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>

<p>Total Evaluated Price (TEP): Price proposals will be evaluated based on the TEP. The TEP will be calculated as the sum of the Offeror's proposed prices for a basic period, all option year periods (4 years), and 6-month extensions. Evaluation of options/extensions shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options or extensions. The TEP will be used for evaluation purposes only. Proposed pricing for the 6-month extension will be based on each Option period to determine the total evaluated price. IAW FAR 52.217-8, offerors should not propose different pricing for each 6-month extension. The rate should be based on that period's monthly rate. For example, the monthly rate used for CLIN 0002 should be the same rate used for CLIN 0001.</p>
<p>The 6-month extension of services is IAW FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services" and will only be utilized if necessary. The 6-month extension of services is not to be considered part of the Option Year periods and will be a separate option exercise if it is utilized. However, proposed pricing for the 6-month extension will be based on the current performance period's (base or subsequent option year) pricing as detailed in Section B of the resulting contract.</p>

(b) To comply with this statute, the Government has conducted a best efforts screening of the specifications and standards associated with this acquisition to determine whether they contain any ODS requirements. To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document. (c) If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action. To preclude delay to the procurement, offerors should provide any information as soon as possible after release of the solicitation and prior to the submission of offers to the extent practicable. It should be understood that there is no obligation on offerors to comply with this request and that no compensation can be provided for doing so. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>The following insurance is required as a minimum; (a) Legally Required Insurance: Where certain laws apply such as State laws governing workman?s compensation and employer?s liability coverage, etc., the contractor, prior to commencement of work, shall furnish the Contracting Officer a written statement that such laws have been complied with and that compliance will continue throughout the period of contract performance.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

It is therefore in the best interest of the Government to afford the parties a full and complete understanding of their respective obligations.

(2) Rules, regulations, directions, and requirements which are issued by command authorities under their responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the installation, or who travel on Government transportation.

A.  Quality of Service
Unsatisfactory	Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards containing similar requirements.
Poor	Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.
Satisfactory	There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.
Good	There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate additional costs to the Government.
Excellent	The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Good". 
B. Timeliness of Performance
Unsatisfactory	Delays are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.
Poor	Delays require significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.
Satisfactory	There are no, or minimal, delays that impact achievement of contract requirements.
Good	There are no delays and the contractor has exceeded the agreed upon time schedule.
Excellent	The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Good".
C.  Business Relations
Unsatisfactory	Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is not effective. If not substantially mitigated or corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards.
Poor	Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is marginally effective.
Satisfactory	Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is consistently effective.
Good	Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues exceeds Government expectation.
Excellent	The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Good".
D.  Cost Control
Unsatisfactory	Cost control is not effective. If not substantially mitigated or corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards.
Poor	Cost control is marginally effective.
Satisfactory	Cost control is consistently effective.
Good	Cost control exceeds Government expectation.
Excellent	The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level in Cost Control. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Good".

<SUBJECT>RFI: DMSP C2 Into NOAA and/or NSA Ground Systems
<SOLNBR>WM012014
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>033114
<CONTACT>Felicia N. Brown, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 653-3515, Email felicia.brown@losangeles.af.mil - John Tanaiweski, Technical , Phone (719) 556-2495, Email John.Tanaiweski.1@us.af.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to determine the feasibility and associated cost estimates for incorporating the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) command and control (C2) capability within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and/or National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite ground system architectures located at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland (NSOF), MD and applicable backup facilities, as appropriate. The Government is interested in identifying innovative Ideas from industry that enable continued ground system support of the operational mission through End-of Life (EOL) (mid 2020's) while simultaneously reducing the cost to operate and maintain the C2 capability.</p>
<p>The Government expects to receive comments and suggestions which will assist in improving draft acquisition documents needed to affect this change. Specifically, suggestions that may improve pre-award planning, timelines, as well as any additional pertinent information industry deems necessary to improve the quality of the entire Request For Proposal (RFP) package.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>DMSP provides an enduring and survivable capability to collect and disseminate global visible and infrared cloud data to support worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) operations and high priority programs.</p>
<p>The DMSP mission was to be subsumed by the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). The NPOESS program, suffering delays and cost-overruns due to issues with sensor developments, was dissolved effective 29 Sep 2010. Ownership of the DMSP Command, Control, and Communications (C3) Ground System (GS), known as DC3GS, was transferred from NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) to the United States Air Force, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) in June 2010. SMC/WML (Colorado Springs) is the DC3GS Program Management Office (PMO). NOAA continues to operate the system on behalf of the Air Force.</p>
<p>The GS is an earth based command, telemetry and data processing system providing all functions for the state-of-health maintenance, communications, sensor payload data retrieval and dissemination, and launch and early orbit support for the DMSP constellation. The DMSP operation centers that command and control the DMSP constellation have not been technically refreshed in over twenty years. Major components of the system were reused from legacy control centers and in some cases are beyond their end of life expectancy. The ground system is operating under an Authority-to-Operate which is at risk due to system equipment being incapable of supporting current security postures.</p>
<p>Primary DMSP C2 satellite operations is conducted at NSOF's Space Operation Center, Suitland, MD and backup at the Environmental Satellite Operations Center (ESOC), operated by the, 6th Space Operations Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (AFB) CO. Five crews each of five personnel support satellite operations. Satellite contact is made through the Fairbanks Satellite Operations Facility, Fairbanks, AK; Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) ground stations worldwide; and McMurdo GS, Antarctic. Command and/or data recovery at the higher latitude, polar locations are particularly advantageous due to access nearly every orbit. Principle DMSP users are the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Omaha, NE; and the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC), at Monterey, CA.</p>
<p><br />Statement of Need</p>
<p>The purpose of this effort is to sustain the DMSP C3 capability through the projected EOL. Particular interest is to reduce long term operations and maintenance costs through leveraging existing NOAA or NASA infrastructure; increasing automation; use of commercial satellite ground link antennas or services; and minimalizing use of AFSCN.</p>
<p>Trade space:<br />&bull; Use of AFSCN / NOAA / NASA / commercial antenna assets should be considered for commanding, up/downlinks, and data distribution<br />o Via cost effective and industry standard best practices<br />&bull; Use of automation to minimize operations costs<br />&bull; Change of operations concepts to reduce crew size <br />&bull; Investments, if any, needed to enable operational migration<br />&bull; Other relevant options the industry partner thinks is appropriate</p>
<p>Constraints:<br />&bull; Central user (AFWA / FNMOC) interfaces must be maIntained<br />&bull; Interfaces for space segment assets/equipment located at the NSOF must be maintained<br />o Primary Display System (Northrup Grumman)<br />o Advanced Flight Vehicle Simulation Facility (AFVSF) (Lockheed Martin)<br />&bull; Interfaces for the McMurdo Data Transfer Station (JPSS) must be maintained<br />&bull; DMSP SORD Reliability, Availability, Maintainability metric requirements must be met<br />&bull; Central user data delivery rate and latency requirements must be met</p>
<p>The following services are expected to be included in the RFI response:<br />&bull; Activities necessary to sustain the GS's ability to command and control DMSP assets<br />&bull; Components, if any, needed to be procured to enable an operational migration onto NOAA/NASA ground systems and their cost estimates.<br />&bull; Commercial services, if any, needed to be procured and their cost estimates<br />&bull; Activities necessary to receive, process, analyze, and disseminate telemetry and mission data to central users<br />&bull; Activities necessary to identify and resolve ground, space, and user segment anomalies / deficiencies<br />&bull; Activities necessary to obtain / maintain compliance with applicable US Government Information Assurance issuances or requirements<br />&bull; Life cycle costs estimates, to included projected O&amp;M savings, and methodology used</p>
<p>Access to Important Documents</p>
<p>All documents related to DMSP are considered to be sensitive but unclassified; therefore the Government has created a&nbsp;CD which will contain all applicable procurement documents. Below are instructions on how to get a copy of the CD:</p>
<p>Vendors need to fill out a nondisclosure form (please see attachment) and attach it in an email to Felicia.brown@us.af.mil requesting access to the site. Along with the NDA, please insert in the email the address where the CD shall be mailed to.</p>
<p>Due to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) requirements, only US citizens will be granted access IAW the Arms Export Control Act. In addition, documents shall only be released IAW DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5230.24.</p>
<p>The email should contain the following information:<br />&bull;Name of user<br />&bull;Company/Organization<br />&bull;Email Address<br />&nbsp;Physical Address where the CD shall be mailed to<br />&bull;Phone</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Alaska District is conducting market research to facilitate determination of acquisition strategy.

This market research is being conducted in order to identify&nbsp;firms with the capabilities to perform the following requirement:</p>
<p>The Alaska District is contemplating an Unrestricted Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with capacity of approximately $200 Million to perform Environmental Remediation Services (ERS) in support of a wide range of customers serviced by the Alaska District. Environmental remediation services work executed under the new IDIQ contracts will primarily include investigations, studies, engineering support, remedial designs, removal and remedial actions and operations and maintenance activities for our customers. The contracts will support the Alaska District's Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) program, Army and Air Force environmental programs and the environmental programs of other non-DoD customers. Task orders may be firm fixed price or cost reimbursement therefore potential contractors must possess accounting systems adequate for award of cost reimbursement work.</p>
<p>Military customers include the Army, Air Force, Air Force Space Command (AFSC), the Alaskan Command (ALCOM), and Army Medical Command (AMC). Other customers include agencies outside the Department of Defense (DoD), such as the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
