<DESC>C2AOS and C2 Information Services (C2IS) are companion Air Force programs planned to transition Theater Battle Management Core Systems Force Level (TBMCS FL) to a Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) environment through incremental introduction of a set of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based Capability Modules (CMs).  Following a layered architecture that emphasizes separation of concerns, C2AOS will focus on mission CMs and C2IS will focus on data CMs.  An initial goal of the C2AOS program is to provide replacement solutions for the Air Mission Management, Airspace Management, and other mission capabilities in TBMCS FL.  A secondary goal for C2AOS is to complete the evolution of mission capabilities into a well-partitioned set of Mission CMs separate from the C2IS Data CMs.  The AF also intends to offer these CMs to the NECC program through their Adopt-Buy-Create (ABC) process.  The Government envisions separate and distinct procurement activities for the Air M! ission Management and Airspace Management modules.

<CONTACT>Michael E. Allen, Contracting Officer, Phone 7704882856, Email MEAllen@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. <br />The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) intends to modify an existing contract number 200-2004-09985 by adding twelve (12) additional months to this cost-plus-fixed-fee contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation, to University of Missouri Columbia, 310 Jesse Hall, Columbia, MO 65211. University of Missouri Columbia is the only vendor to establish and maintain a GHB standardization program following the American Association of Clinical Chemistry (AACC) Standards Committee's protocol. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to (1) establish and maintain the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) primary reference method, (2) establish a network of reference laboratories, all of which maintain reference methods or precise methods traceable to the reference method, (3) monitor Network Laboratories monthly to meet monitoring criteria, (4) Through the Network, to interact with manufacturers of GHB methods, providing assistance in standardizing their methods and then providing comparison data for certification of traceability to the DCCT, (5) the effort shall provide assessment of effectiveness of the program through evaluation of independent Proficiency Testing data from College of American Pathologists (CAP). (6) To provide data and reference materials to assist CDC in the development of definitive reference method. (7) The Contractor shall establish and maintain a C-peptide standardization program for select laboratories following guidelines.</p>
<p>The scope of work involves furnishing all the necessary labor, materials, facilities, and equipment necessary to establish and maintain a GHB standardization program following the American Association of Clinical Chemistry (AACC) Standards Committee's protocol. The program shall establish and monitor a voluntary network of reference laboratories for GHB testing, which, in turn, interact with manufacturers of GHB methods to (1) assist in standardizing their methods; and (2) provide comparison data for certification of traceability to DCCT primary reference method. Two elements are key in the design of the program: (1) an Administrative Center to coordinate certification processes, analyze certification and monitoring data, and issue certificates of traceability; and (2) a Central Primary Reference Laboratory that analyzes GHB by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Bio-Rex 70 resin, sets the initial calibration based on the "set-point" used in the DCCT, and administers a monitoring program for all certified laboratories.</p>
<p>CDC believes that University of Missouri Columbia is the only source available to provide this product that meets mission critical requirements. CDC posted a sources sought synopsis&nbsp;on April 10, 2007 identifying University of Missouri as the only known, responsible source capable of satisfying the requirement. The CDC responded to one inquiry to the April 10, 2007 synopsis, however, at that time no interested offeror successfully demonstrated a capability to meet the minimum requirements identified in the statement of work (copy attached). Accordingly, the CDC awarded 200-2004-09985 to University of Missouri dated September 01, 2004 for $1,692,305. Presently, the CDC requires additional services from University of Missouri (see attached modified Statement of Work) and thus intends to negotiate a bi-lateral modification to the contract with University of Missouri for the additional services and extend the period of from September 30, 2009 to September 30, 2010.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541380 -- Testing Laboratories.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Michael E. Allen via email to MEAllen@cdc.gov including the reference number "200-2004-09985" in the subject line, no-later-than 2:30 PM, Eastern Standard Time, on July 17, 2009.</p>

The original scope and purpose of the contract will notchange with the addition of the ARRA Stimulus Funds.  The Total ContractPricewill not increase as a result of this modification.The TOC Contract is a $7.1B performance-based cost plus award fee contractwithspecific performance-based incentives awarded to Washington RiverProtectionSolutions, LLC (WRPS) May 29, 2008.   The purpose of the contract is tofurnishsafe, compliant, cost-effective and energy-efficient services to furthertheDepartment of Energy, Office of River Protection (ORP) mission to store,retrieve and treat Hanford tank waste, store and dispose of treated waste,andto close the Tank Farm waste management areas to protect the ColumbiaRiver.Modification A015 obligates ARRA funding in the amount of $42.5 milliondollarsto meet the original contract funding profile and accelerate work that wascontemplated in the five-year (5) base period and first option period.  Thespecific period of performance is as follows:Base Period   October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2013,Option Period 1   October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2016,Option Period 2   October 1, 2016 through September 2018Modification A015 creates a new contract line item number (CLIN) tosegregatethe ARRA funded workscope to be accelerated.CLIN 7  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Workscope- Sub-CLIN 7.1 - ARRA workscope under Sub-CLIN 1.2 - Safe, CompliantOperations.  Maintain and operate the Tank Farms, 242-A Evaporator, andsupporting Tank Farm infrastructure.  Perform all required project supportfunctions (project management, integrated safety management, security andemergency services, interactions, interface management).- Sub-CLIN 7.2 - ARRA workscope under Sub-CLIN 1.3 - Analytical LaboratorySupport.  Operate and maintain the 222-S Laboratory Complex to supportanalysisactivities performed under a separate DOE-ORP contract.- Sub-CLIN 7.3 - ARRA workscope under Sub-CLIN 3.1 - Treatment Planning,WasteFeed Delivery, and WTP Transition.  Provide integrated system planning fortheDOE-ORP mission and perform project planning, system upgrades/replacements,andoperations to accomplish waste feed delivery to treatment facilities.  Planforthe turnover of completed WTP facilities.- Sub-CLIN 7.4 - ARRA workscope under Sub-CLIN 3.3 - Immobilized High-LevelWaste (IHLW) Storage and Shipping Facility Construction.  Modify theCanisterStorage Building and/or design, construct, commission, and operate aseparateinterim storage facility for IHLW canisters from WTP and a shippingfacility toprepare IHLW and spent nuclear fuel (SNF) canisters for shipment to apermanentrepository.Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:Contract Clause I.103, FAR 52.243-2 Changes  Cost Reimbursement (AUG1987),ALT II (APR 1984), ALT III (APR 1984), ALT IV (APR 1984) of the contractauthorizes the Contracting Officer to make changes within the general scopeofthe contract.The work scope considered for acceleration as a result of the receipt oftheARRA funds is clearly within the scope of the contract and specificallyidentified in Sub-CLIN 1.2, Safe, and Compliant Operations, Sub-CLIN 1.3,Analytical Laboratory Support, and Sub-CLIN 3.1, Treatment Planning, WasteFeedDelivery, and WTP Transition.  Offerors were provided ample opportunity topropose to this specific scope of work during the initial TOC competition.Notonly was this work specifically identified in the TOC SOW, but also in theWBSDictionary sheets and within Section J, Attachment J. 11 Supplemental WorkDescription Tables provided to Offerors during the TOC solicitation.Offerorswere further put on notice via Section B.14, DOE Authorization of Work,thatthe ORP reserved the right to turn work on/off as funding was madeavailablethrough the contract period of performance.The prospects for performing the TOC scope of work under a firm fixed-price(FFP) contract were evaluated prior to the recent TOC competition.  Theworkcontemplated is highly complex and many variables exist that do not lendthemselves to being FFP. This, coupled with the fact that the work scopehasalready been defined, competed, and awarded under the TOC, a Cost Pluscontractwith Performance-Based Incentives, FFP efforts at the prime level are notpossible.  ORP has communicated to the TOC contractor that FFP subcontractsshall be utilized to the maximum extent possible in accomplishing thespecifictasks executed with ARRA funds.Primary Point of Contact: Joseph C. Poniatowski, Contracting Officer,Office ofRiver Protection,  509-376-2760Secondary Point of Contact:  Susan E. Bechtol, Contracting Officer, OfficeofRiver Protection, 509-376-3388

<DESC>On behalf of the National Defense University, the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Business Center, intends to award a sole source award to Educomm Inc, 250 W. Main Street, Charlottesville, VA 22902.  This acquisition is under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), as prescribed by 48 C.F.R. 13.501.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For information or questions please respond by email to Steven_M_Shatz@nbc.gov.
The NAICS code for this requirement is 611430 and the small business size standard is "Not to Exceed" $6,500,000.
Description of Requirement: The objective of this sole source award is to provide a customized graduate business school executive education seminar to educate incoming officers on the fundamentals of contemporary business, and the different trends and factors that drive strategic business planning.  
Location:  Services may be provided off-site, on-site, or a combination of, depending on program requirements.  However, the majority of the work will be performed at training facilities to be provided by the contactor.  Required travel will be limited to the Washington, DC region.
Period of Performance: The period of performance for this order will be for 1 year, from date of award, with 4 annual options.

The reasons justifying the lack of competition are as follows:
a. This work would be a continuation of services provided under a previous contract  
b. The Graduate Business School Executive Education provided is required each year for the incoming group of new SDCFP officers in preparation for their assignments at corporate sponsors.  Because the SDCFP is a unique program, where military officers with no prior experience in the civilian corporate environment are assigned to train in corporate assignments, a customized curriculum is required.  Educomm, Inc. developed the original seminar curriculum and has provided it, with yearly updates, for the past 10 years.  There is no existing Executive Education curriculum from other sources that could be used "off the shelf."  While providing training in prior years, Educomm has utilized a pool of highly qualified and experienced Graduate Business School professors who are now knowledgeable about the unique educational requirements of the military officers receiving training and can tailor their individual seminar sessions accordingly.  Training from another source would lose this valuable insight and reduce the quality of the education provided.  
c. All training materials from prior years are exclusively owned by Educomm and would not be transferrable to another source.  Development and approval of a new curriculum from scratch would entail weeks of time and effort after contract award, at an additional expense that must be recovered and duplicate work already done by Educomm.  Due to the specialized and customized aspect of the training material that has already been developed by Educomm, it is not feasible for another contractor to develop materials that would not infringe on Educomm's intellectual rights to the program that they have already developed. 
d. Since Educomm has already recovered its curriculum developmental costs, it can now provide the training at costs substantially below those in the previous contract.  
e. To be most beneficial, this training should be given prior to officers arriving at their corporate assignments and any additional delays to develop a new curriculum would be detrimental.

<DESC><p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Renishaw, Inc., of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, for the purchase of a Laser Measuring System.</p>
<p>NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.</p>
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the U.S. Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The NIST Machine Tool Metrology Group requests an upgrade of their existing and outdated Renishaw ML10 laser measurement system. The current ML10 no longer meets their requirements for high-accuracy, state-of-the-art measurements. In addition, technical support and maintenance for the ML10 system are no longer available from the manufacturer. NIST staff have invested substantial time and resources to establish a machine tool measurement capability based on the existing ML10 system, including development and implementation of critical hardware and software components used in their laboratory. NIST requires the replacement laser measurement system to be fully compatible with these existing hardware and software components (including data fils, mounting tripod, steering optics, other Renishaw optical components, etc.) to have an integrated system. This compatibility is necessary to maintain project efficiency, ensure interoperability, prevent the need for substantial re-development, reduce training requirements and minimize cost to the U.S. Government. The Renishaw XL80 laser measurement system is the only available system that meets the U.S. Government needs for high accuracy (+/-0.5 ppm) and full compatibility with other existing components.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334513, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The U.S. Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. (ET) on July 17, 2009. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to charles.koehler@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the U.S. Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>Introduction

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), will be seeking proposals from qualified organizations with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) capable of conducting all aspects (administrative guidance, oversight, and support) of a multi-center Randomized Evaluation of VAD InterVEntion before Inotropic Therapy (REVIVE-IT) feasibility clinical study. 

This acquisition has not been designated a type of set aside, this information will be available upon solicitation posting. It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement contract award for a period of five years will be made. THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS NOT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP); the Request For Proposals will be available on or about July 23, 2009. The estimated due date for proposals is December 9, 2009. 

Background

The purpose of this clinical feasibility study is to explore the potential benefit of mechanical circulatory support therapy using ventricular assist devices (VADs) in functionally-impaired advanced heart failure patients who have not yet developed serious consequences from their disease.  The study will serve to inform a pivotal trial directed at a large and growing patient population for whom VADs could offer substantial benefit beyond current medical therapies.  

Project Requirements

The clinical study to be developed will test the hypothesis that VAD therapy improves both survival and quality of life in those advanced heart failure patients who are neither inotrope-dependent nor exercise-intolerant and have not yet developed serious consequences such as malnourishment, end-organ damage, and immobility.  The recommendations made by the NHLBI Working Group on the Clinical Use of VADs are given below.  

 Study hypothesis: VAD therapy in the proposed patient population will improve functional status at 12 months post-randomization and all cause mortality will be no worse than that in the optimal medical management arm of the study. 
 Patients for the study should be ill enough to potentially experience both functional and survival benefits from the therapy without undue risk. 
 The estimated mortality rate for this group should be 20%- 30% at one year. 
 Patient Population Inclusion Criteria includes (1) hospitalization in past 6 months, (2) NYHA Class IV or Advanced Class III, (3) maximal evidence-based therapies for 3 months, (4) duration of heart failure of at least a year, and (5) no inotropic support for 30 days prior to enrollment.
 The study should be randomized between VAD and optimal medical management (OMM) arms
 The primary endpoint should be a composite of survival and functional status where the improvement in functional status would need to be substantial and assessed through objective metrics.
 Secondary endpoints are safety, secondary functional and physiologic markers, quality of life, neurocognition, and cost and cost effectiveness.
 Patients should be followed for at least two years.
 Substantial evidence of acceptable clinical performance is required for VADs to be used in the study. 

The DCC is expected to develop the clinical study plan (including specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and rationale, device(s) for the VAD therapy arm of the clinical study, adverse event definitions, and functional, quality of life, and neurocognitive measures), a draft protocol, negotiate and obtain signed contracts/agreements with clinical sites and industry partners. 

Required activities by the DCC include, but are not limited to, (1) finalizing all details of the clinical study to provide evidence for the proposed hypothesis and to assess recruitment and data quality; (2) finalizing the clinical protocol and protocol-related documents (e.g. informed consent form, case report forms, etc.); (3) implementation and conduct of the clinical study in accordance with all Federal requirements; (4) management and oversight of the conduct of the clinical study; (5) providing clinical research support services; (6) providing monitoring and safety oversight; (7) providing site training and support; (8) organizing investigator and DSMB meetings and teleconferences; (9) recruiting and randomizing patients; (10) organizing, conducting, and reimbursing for patient protocol evaluations and tests (including follow-up); and (11) analyzing the data and authoring and submitting papers on the study for publication.

<DESC><p>RML Dedicated Electrical Feed from Northwestern Energy
<p>Existing:</p>
<p>This acquisition will be funded by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009. The National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Facilities, Office of Acquisitions intends to award a sole source contract to Northwestern Energy to provide a dedicated electrical feed as described below.<br /><br />Currently Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) has a single 12,470-volt primary feeder serving the RML campus provided from the local utility company, Northwestern Energy. The feeder currently provides power to the campus and a large amount of residential customers and is an overhead line that runs along Highway 93 and down residential streets to the North and West sides of the RML campus.</p>
<p>The existing overhead line to the campus has three separate taps for underground feeds (one on the North side of Campus and two on the West side) that enter the campus to three each utility owned pad mounted transformers. Each of the three underground feed services are separately metered by the utility company and billed at commercial rates, not primary metering rates.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:<br />The contractor shall provide both design and construction services, including inspections and quality control to accomplish the following:<br />1. Provide a new primary feeder to RML. The new feeder will be dedicated to feeding the RML campus exclusively and will have no other customers connected to it, now or in the future. The new feeder shall extend from the Northwestern Energy sub-station to the campus by the most direct route feasible and available and connect to the existing RML West Distribution location on the west side of campus. <br />2. A new underground feeder shall be installed from the new service point on the West side of campus to connect to the East Distribution power connection point at 5th and Baker so that the entire campus will be fed and metered from the new dedicated feeder. The actual routing shall be determined during design but must accommodate normal and back-up power feed to the East distribution from Building 27 (Emergency Generator Location) by the most feasible route.<br />3. A manual primary switch will be installed that will allow the existing overhead primary line to serve as a backup supply for the campus should the new primary feeder fail. This switch shall be located at or near the existing West Side distribution location with the exact location to be coordinated during final design.<br />4. The RML will assume ownership of the existing utility pad mounted transformers and underground primary feeders located on the campus property.<br />5. The government is in the process of purchasing land immediately adjacent to the campus to the north. The existing overhead power lines along the north edge of the campus shall be relocated to allow a parking lot to be constructed without overhead power poles and still be capable of serving the East and West side distributions should the new primary feeder fail.</p>
<p>As part of the proposed installation, all easements and right of ways shall be secured by Northwestern Energy including crossing the highway adjacent to the utility sub-station. The installation shall conform to Northwestern Energy requirements and inspections shall be conducted by them. Calculations on sizing of the feeders shall be submitted to the Government for review and acceptance. Feeder capacity shall be greater than or equal to 7MVA (7000 KVA) to provide for current and future loads. Actual feeder routes and equipment locations on and near the RML campus shall be submitted to the Government for review and acceptance.</p>
<p>Costs are to be broken down according to the attached bid schedule. If adequate funding is not available to complete each of the work items, the base work must result in a functional dedicated feeder to RML.</p>
<p>The Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition in support if this acquisition will be posted&nbsp;with solicitation on or about 17 July 2009.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NAME BRAND JUSTIFICATION FOR CISCO ITEMS</p>
<p>Name Brand Justification of OSO Cisco Network Procurements</p>
<p>The Cisco Model 3845 Integrated Services Router, the Cisco 3845 and Cisco Ether Switch represents the network equipment that the Office of Satellite Operations (OSO) currently maintains with existing spares at each site. All of the OSO Operational networks are running on Cisco network equipment, which are integral parts of the entire system. The procurement of these new CISCO system components will be supporting the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) data, as well as the Initial Joint Polar-Orbiting Operational Satellite System (IJPS) mission.</p>
<p>For the past several years, OSO has been running the IJPS network configuration to channelize the bandwidth shared between EUMETSAT and OSO to provide cost savings as it relates to equipment and circuit consolidation. The CISCO 3845 Routers with the required interfaces have proven to be a well engineered solution that continues to provide proven performance for the IJPS 24x7x365 Mission Critical System. An important factor that is driving this additional consolidation for the MSG data concerns the fact that the current FTS2001 Sprint T-1 circuit supporting this mission between EUMETSAT and Wallops Island, VA will be expiring in early 2010. The current DS-3 that is operational between EUMETSAT and Wallops Island has excess bandwidth available that is not being utilized to support the mission. Consolidating the existing DS-3 and disconnecting the expiring Spring T-1, will result in a substantial cost savings for the Government. It is, however, imperative that we implement a proven, reliable solution that will enable OSO to implement this valuable, cost savings solution before we risk the loss of the expiring T-1. This approach has been reviewed and discussed by all sites involved, and with consideration to the support that is required by EUMETSAT in Darmstadt, Germany, we must remain focused on this proven CISCO solution to successfully complete this mission critical transition.</p>
<p>The implementation of different system network components would cost OSO and EUMETSAT an unnecessary loss of valuable time and data. Personnel would require additional training, which would still result in an unproven solution that introduces a high risk factor to the missions.</p>
<p>WCDAS Network personnel, along with site support from Suitland and EUMETSAT, have the knowledge and the ability to configure, test, and operate the Cisco equipment and complete this transition via a proven, well engineered plan.</p>

<DESC>A9320095022Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) the National Park Service anticipates soliciting a proposal from a single source, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, for a surface-to-bottom tethered Lake-Moored-profiler system. The critical requirements include interface with a remote deep-water profiling instrument.  The surface communication buoy would: 1) provide buoyancy for keeping a wire rope mooring vertical in the water column, 6) house the batteries and electronics in a waterproof pressure case, 3) communicate with an underwater profiling instrument via the wire rope mooring, 4) download the digital data daily from the profiling instrument, 5) store the digital data in computer memory, and 6) transmit the data via satellite phone to a shore-based computer. The mooring would be located in the deep-basin (582 meter) of Crater Lake and the profiling instrument would be programmed to travel once a day from the lake bottom to the lake surface and back. During the round-trip profile, the instrument would collect information on temperature, conductivity, chlorophyll concentration, dissolved organic matter concentration, and turbidity throughout the water column.  The data would then be downloaded off the profiler by the surface communication buoy, stored in memory, relayed wirelessly to shore, and then uploaded to a website, thereby providing near-real time lake water column conditions throughout the year. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   For information or questions please respond by email to Jack_Northcutt@nps.gov or forward your questions by fax to (541) 594-3010 Attn: Contracting Officer.

Proposed Issue Date: July 17, 2009
Title of Project: Provide Accessibility to Park Comfort Stations and Picnic Camp Sites
Location: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee and North Carolina
Description:  The work consists of construction and/or rehabilitation of comfort stations, picnic sites, and camp sites, to make them accessible for those with disabilities.  The project includes rehabilitation of ten (10) comfort stations and potentially adding three (3) alternate comfort stations.  Work includes replacing the following comfort station features:  sinks, toilets, doors, bathroom partitions, walkways, soap dispensers, floor surfaces, faucets, hand dryers, electrical outlets, shelves, hanging hooks, lighting, and electrical sockets to make the comfort stations accessiible.  In addition, the comfort stations will be made structurally and mechanically sound.  Roofs, windows, plumbing and woodwork will be repaired and/or replaced at each comfort station.  Work will also include completely replacing two (2) comfort stations with new structures, at the Deep Creek and Twin Creeks picnic areas, to meet accessiblity issues and provide correct size stations for visitors.  Picnic and campsites will be improved by the construction of accessible parking spaces with a connecting accessible walkway to the camp or picnic site.  Each site will have an accessible picnic table and cooking grill placed on a firm material.  New camp sites are for both recreational vehicle and tents.  Accessible sites will be increased in size to allow improved access.  The work is located completely within the boundaries of Great Smoky Mountains National Park located both in Tennessee and North Carolina.  The approximate distance between the farthest work sites is 70 miles.  The work will occur at three (3) picnic areas:  Chimneys, Deep Creek, and Twin Creeks; as well as three (3) campgrounds: Cades Cove, Elkmont, and Smokemont.  Access between the sites is on Park roads which can be steep, winding, and closed periodically due to weather.  Travel times increase during the summer season due to traffic congestion.
Type of Procurement: It is anticipated that a negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price. This will be a HUBZone set-aside.
Estimated price range: $3,000,000 to $4,000,000, including options.
Time for completion: Approximate completion date is September, 2010. If options are awarded, contract time will be extended as appropriate to complete the additional work.
A Pre-Proposal Conference is anticipated.  Date and time to be announced at the time proposal documents are avaiable.
Proposal receipt date is approximately August 17, 2009; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
This project is 100% HUBZone set-aside.  
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 
Small Disadvantaged Business & HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns (May 2004) & 52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (July 2005) (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic SB Search).

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR), Naval Air Warfare and Weapons Department (ONR 35) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for conduct of basic research in technology areas relevant to rotorcraft. As basic research, proposed projects should develop new scientific knowledge, improve theoretical understanding, and provide a basis for advances in rotorcraft technology. Research topics should focus on basic scientific issues inspired by rotorcraft technology needs and having the potential for making significant contributions towards Navy research thrusts and DoD goals and missions. Technology transfer and the partnering of this research with the US rotorcraft industry, U.S. Navy, other Government organizations (e.g., U.S. Army, NASA, FAA) and other academic institutions are encouraged.

The proposed research should emphasize innovative, creative basic research rather than application of existing technologies. Projects should not be directed at specific aircraft or systems, and need not offer immediate or specifically identifiable improvements in rotorcraft technology. Projects that merely apply engineering methods to develop or evaluate unusual vehicle configurations or components are not of interest under this Announcement. Although software development per se is not a goal of this announcement, projects demonstrating new methods via their software implementation will be considered.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to seek proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing services to Promote More Democratic and Effective Municipalities in Ecuador.  

This is a full and open competition, under which any type of organization (U. S. or non-U.S., large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organization) is eligible to compete. The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  

USAID plans to award a three-year cost reimbursement plus fixed fee completion-type contract with a total estimated cost in the range of $5,900,000 to $6,900,000 covering a total estimated period of three years.  Revealing the estimated range for the contract does not mean that offerors should necessarily strive to meet the maximum amount estimated.  Offerors must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost Proposals will be evaluated as part of a best value determination for contract award, including cost effective approaches to achieving the results.

Offerors are advised that funds are not yet available for award at this time.  This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package, that will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov, no less than 15 days after this notice.  Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.  Telephonic requests or inquiries will not be taken.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Requirement 

The United States Government currently occupies office space and related space in a building under lease in Brownsville, TX.   The Government is seeking to lease two buildings that are in very close proximity to each other.  The first building should be approximately 13,600 rentable square feet of office space.  The second building should be 2,130 rentable square feet of office related space. The rentable spaces must yield a minimum of 12,719 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet (OASF) and 2,006 contiguous ANSI/BOMA OASF, respectively.

The lease term requirement is for 10 years, 5 years firm. The space must be available for occupancy by April 16, 2010. The delineated area is the city of Brownsville, TX. Only existing buildings will be considered.

Other applicable requirements include:

<a href="mailto:pwilson@aatd.eustis.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate</a>
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of a noncommercial program entitled, Universal Control (UC) Fuel Authority Digital Engine Control.  The Armys overarching requirement is to continue developing and qualifying an advanced next generation engine UC that demonstrates commonality across all Army aviation engines simplifying logistical support for such controls while significantly reducing weight, size, and life cycle cost.  The acquisition builds upon previously completed UC contracted research and development as well as independent research and development conducted by Goodrich Pump and Engine Control Systems, Inc. (GPECs).  AATD anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to GPECs, who is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable of building on previous UC development efforts to meet this requirement.  The IDIQ shall continue to pursue GPECs UC concepts which have application to multiple Army engine platforms, which exploit software partitioning and accommodates advanced adaptive control software concepts such as model based controls and neural network diagnostics and prognostics.  The IDIQ shall continue to address circuit board architectures which addresses commonality and component obsolescence and Open Systems Architectures.  The IDIQ continues to address system physical size, and reduced product cost targets by 30% and has the capability to orchestrate and interface with on-board Health Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS).  The UC technology provides engine diagnostics and prognostics information which will interface into the Army Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) systems.  Market research revealed that only GPECs has developed the unique type of turboshaft UC technology  The maximum value of the contract will be $9.9 million.  The contract minimum value of $400,000 will be met with award of the first task order issued as a cost-plus-fixed-fee order.  The funding for this requirement is Congressionally appropriated for research, development, qualification testing, and flight testing of engine Universal Control (UC) technology.  Accordingly, this acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l), as implemented by  FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as market research has identified only GPECs as the only source building on and developing these specific UC technologies.  The Government deems that substantial duplication of cost incurred under the previously conducted research cannot be recovered through competition.  No other known source has the equivalent technical maturity, or rights necessary to satisfy the Government requirement.  Many of the concepts to be further explored under the planned efforts are either patented or proprietary to GPECs.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to GPECs.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and GPECs, consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  Performance under this acquisition will require access to and generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec.2751 et.seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C. App 2401 et. seq.  An Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement certification number issued in accordance with Dod Directive 5230.25 will be required for this acquisition.  This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN:  DLSC-FBA Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572.   The overall period of performance for the IDIQ contract is sixty (60) months.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NIACS) code is 541712 and the size standard is 1,000.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposal shall be submitted no later than August 17, 2009 at 12:00pm EST and should be addressed to AATD, Attn: RDMR-AAC (Ms. Paulette L. Wilson), Building 401, Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, 23604-5577.  Ms. Wilsons phone number is 757-878-2788.

This information will be used to identify which ceramic materials work best against specific threats and to develop a better engineered helmet and personal protective equipment.

<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This is a sources sought notice solely issued to identify a qualified small business firm capable of providing an upgrade to an existing Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) located in the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences. This department provides imaging services to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Centers patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH Institutes.  Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures).  Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).

Authority: 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b). Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this final phase of the study, which provides for testing in a more genetically diverse set of test animals.</p>

This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIEHS to determine if the party can meet the requirements.

To assist in evaluating requirements the attached contract tracker lists current contracts at each site with estimated hours for the coming five year period. 

The Government anticipates releasing a single solicitation from which multiple IDIQ contracts will be competed on an independent basis.  Requirements in the solicitation will be divided by site into individual Lots with one IDIQ contract awarded for each Lot.  The Government may award as few as one (1) or as many as six (6) contracts and anticipates that portions of this requirement may be offered as Full and Open Competition, small business and/or 8(a) competitions on a site by site basis.  The Government anticipates that this effort shall be awarded on a predominantly Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) basis, though the contract will contain minor Cost elements to address travel and other secondary requirements.  The Government will make final decisions on set-asides based on market research and responses from this Sources Sought, as well as other procurement and program related criteria.  Therefore, interested businesses should indicate which of the above sites are covered by their response.

Interested businesses should submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the services listed in the attached SOW.  This documentation must address, at a minimum, the following:  (1) prior/current corporate experience performing efforts of similar size and scope within the last three years, including contract number, organization supported, indication of whether as a prime or subcontractor, contract values, Government point of contact with current telephone number, a brief description of how the contract referenced relates to the services described herein; (2) company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office location(s), company website (if applicable), and DUNS number; (3) resources available such as corporate management and currently employed personnel to be assigned to tasks under this effort to include professional qualifications, specific experience of such personnel, and the ability to have personnel located at the cities specified; (4) management approach to staffing this effort with qualified personnel which should address current hires available for assignment to this effort, possible subcontracting/teaming arrangements, and strategy for recruiting and retaining qualified personnel; and (5) provide documentation of the companys ability to begin performance upon contract award (projected award date 1 September 2010).  All responses must include the following information:  Company Name; Company Address; Company Business Size; and Point-of-Contact (POC) name, phone, fax number, and e-mail address.  Please specify to which site(s) the capabilities statement package applies.  

Since the resultant contracts will be on a cost type basis the successful awardees will be required to have a Government approved accounting system upon contract award.

The deadline for submission of information is 17 July 2009 at 3:00 pm eastern time.  

Questions concerning this notice should be submitted to Mr. Benjamin Washburn with a copy to Ms. Michelle Briscoe at the email addresses cited above.  Telephone requests for information WILL NOT be accepted.

<RESPDATE>032009
<CONTACT>Leatrice J. Frederick, Contract Specialist, Phone 8138266513, Email frederl@socom.mil
<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY:</p>
<p>United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)&nbsp;is developing acquisition documentation in support of its Light Mobility Vehicle (LMV) Program. USSOCOM intends to procure up to 112 vehicles in FY10 in support of this requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>USSOCOM's procurement strategy is to award a research and development effort with a Firm Fixed Price multiple year production option to one or multiple vendors possessing a mature prototype.&nbsp; Both the research&nbsp;and development effort and production option will be competed simultaneously.&nbsp; USSOCOM intends to conduct integration, verification testing, and prototype refinement of a mature prototype.&nbsp; A mature prototype for this requirement is defined as a vehicle that has been demonstrated in an operational environment or Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 or greater.&nbsp; Results will be used to determine which offer is the best value for the Government and down select to conduct low rate initial production.&nbsp; Attached is the draft specification which is being provided for industry comment.&nbsp; USSOCOM will accept responses from industry which directly comment on the content of the draft acquisition document.</p>
<p>The intent of this synopsis is two fold:</p>
<p>First, USSOCOM is specifically interested in industry comments related to the alignment of the draft document with current industry capabilities.&nbsp; USSOCOM is pulsing industry and seeking input such as, does industry agree this type of requirement can be largely met with an existing, mature prototype vehicle.&nbsp; If no, then please comment which sections of the draft specification are potentially not attainable with current technologies and limited prototype refinement.</p>
<p>Second, Firms interested and capable of supplying this product should provide the following information: company name, cage code, address, phone number, email address, a point of contact, and type of company within NAICS 336112.&nbsp; Also, contractors shall provide specific product literature as it pertains to the draft specifications; complete vehicle specification sheet; estimated price; and quantity and delivery capability.&nbsp; Please include any results of relevant testing, evaluations, and/or certifications that have been completed on the proposed vehicle.&nbsp; General company product literature will not be considered a response.&nbsp; Information shall be submitted to Leatrice Frederick at <a href="mailto:frederl@socom.mil">frederl@socom.mil</a>&nbsp;or faxed to 813.826.7504, no later than 1200 EDT on March 20, 2009.</p>
<p>This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.&nbsp; This notice shall not be constructed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.&nbsp; No entitlement to payment will arise as a result of the submission of contractor information.&nbsp; No other program information related to total dollars available, total quantity of vehicles authorized, or timeline for official solicitation is available at this time.&nbsp; USSOCOM will post that information in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to FedBizOps after finalization of the acquisition documents.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NOAA Satellite and Information Service (NESDIS) has provided both in-kind and financial support to the Conference over the past 20 years, first when it was hosted at West Chester University and more recently, at California State University at Los Angeles (CSU-LA). The College of Education at CSU-LA is known for its skill in hosting conferences that bring together educators from across the United Stated and the world to interact with scientists and engineers. Originally, the Conference focused upon the ways in which educators could use data from polar-orbiting satellite through the use of direct readout stations at schools. With the growth of the Internet, the Conference has expanded to include geostationary satellite data and a wide variety of satellite applications, such as using data to track forest fires and to estimate vegetation stress.</p>
<p>This annual meeting brings together coastal managers from states, territories, and commonwealths from across the nation and provides a forum for discussion with their federal counterparts on emerging issues in ocean and coastal resource management.</p>
<p>One of the cross-cutting priorities in the NOAA Strategic Plan is "Promoting Environmental Literacy." This Conference provides an avenue for engaging stakeholders from the educational arena. NESDIS scientists are able to provide information about NESDIS products and services in a "train the trainer: concept, where educators take what they learn back to their schools and teach other teachers. By partnering with the university community, other federal agencies, and private industry, NESDIS is able to multiply its outreach endeavors. Other NOAA Line Offices are participating in sponsorship of this Conference.</p>
<p>The Satellite and Education Conference is being coordinated by California State University at Los Angeles and it is believed that there is no responsible source that will satisfy the NOAA/NESDIS requirements. California State University will provide NOAA Satellite with an Executive Report of the Conference, conduct and tabulate a customer survey and provide a written report of the results.</p>
<p>The Satellite and Education Conference is sponsored by the Satellite Educators Association (SEA) in partnership with academia, federal agencies, and private industry. The SEA, established in 1988, is professional society to promote the innovative use of satellite technology in education. Membership includes master educators who use satellites and related technologies as a vehicle for helping students appreciate and understand the complex interrelationships among science, technology, individuals, societies, and the environment. In 2006, over 175 teachers from across the country participated in the Conference.</p>
<p>No other source is known to possess the same capabilities. Notwithstanding the Government's intent to negotiate on a single source basis under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, any source possessing the capabilities to provide the required service may submit a statement of capabilities which, if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. Responses must be received by July 20, 2009. Responses must be emailed to Joel.L.Perlroth@noaa.gov. Award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures pursuant to FAR Part 13 for a base period of 12-months and three additional 12-month option periods.</p>

The Contractor shall perform the following tasks in regards to financial statement reestimate modeling:

IV&V reviews will be limited to validating any corrections made in response to audit findings or questions, validating that SBA has not made any other changes and a model run to validate the cash flows and subsidy rates that result from updating actual performance data through June 30.

  - Part of the IV&V review must be a validation that the correct loan level cash flows are linked or are being properly fed to the cash flows read by the CSC2.  The OCFOs Accounting Liaison and Quality Assurance Branch validated the intra-governmental (lower) portion of the cash flows through the end of fiscal year 2008 prior to the models being sent out for an IV&V review. 

 - Validations that the cash flows generated during the E&Y model run match those provided by SBA or a comparison of the subsidy rates from the Summary tab of the CSC2. 

 - Validation that all model changes have been adequately documented. 

 - Validation of the formulas, SAS code, and methodology used for all changes.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE. The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole-source acquisition with the International Social Security Association (ISSA) of Geneva, Switzerland with the intention of awarding a contract for the service described in this announcement.  

SSA has a need for research and dissemination of information on international social security programs.  Experience and developments in social security programs maintained by other nations are analyzed by SSA and related to SSA program and policy deliberations.  This material is necessary input into SSA totalization agreement negotiations with foreign nations.  Executives within SSA use this information, as do other executive agencies, the congress, researchers and the public.  This activity generates the standard reference document, Social Security Programs Throughout the World (SSPTW) and updates Social Security Worldwide (SSW) an internationally respected publication which has been produced by the Social Security Administration since 1937.  A continuous flow of accurate and reliable data on international program is critical to this program effort.  This requirement calls for the contractor to collect information on social programs in approximately 172 countries, analyze the data and produce four separate volumes of SSPTW. Additionally, it includes updating the most recent SSW to include providing a searchable, linkable electronic version for available social security laws; information on recent developments in social security; and the full text of SSPTW.  The contractor will be required to obtain and provide translations and any other support services necessary to the successful conduct and completion of the project.  The ISSA possesses unique qualification and capabilities in the social security field to meet the project requirements and successfully carry out its objectives.  

For the past 2 decades the ISSA has collected information on social security developments and trends worldwide.  The ISSA regularly produced a number of social security publication on related topics.  The ISSA specialized in social security and has unique and long-established contacts. The ISSAs affiliate members in 139 countries, as well as associate members in 40 countries with whom it has established working relationships, support the Associations aims: the protection, promotion and development of social security throughout the world.  In addition, the ISSA has contact with about 47 non-member countries for the purpose of obtaining social security program information.  Furthermore, the ISSA, which had been in operation since 1927, provides a symposium for the international exchange of information in all areas of social security as broadly defined. The ISSA is a nonpolitical international organization. U.S. agency conduct of this project would preclude access to otherwise obtainable information from certain countries. The ISSA has the capability and support services such as expert staff, physical facilities and translation capabilities, as well as social security contacts mentioned above, to ensure the systematic and consistent flow of materials required to effectively conduct this project. 

The proposed contract is a fixed-priced term contract, with options for additional services. Any organization that believes that it has the capability to perform this work may submit a statement of such capability. This is not a request for proposal. The cost for the preparation and submission of proposals will not be reimbursed by the Government. Responses to this notice should be submitted by July 7, 2009, 2:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time. Respondents WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULTS of an evaluation of the information received.

<DESC>The Force Health Protection and Readiness Program Office of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) has a requirement for non-personal health care services to support the congressionally mandated Mental Health Self Assessment Program as identified in NDAA06 and NDAA07.  The statutory permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 c 1. The FAR citation is FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies and Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Mental Health Self-Assessment Program (MHSAP - Trademark) was originally required by Congress in NDAA06.  That requirement allowed DoD to contract with an academic or community agency, such as a not-for-profit agency, to meet this requirement.  SMH was identified to meet the NDAA06 requirements because of their unique expertise and products.  Because of success of this program in FY06, Congress specifically requires extending and expanding the MHSAP in NDAA07, Sec. 730  Mental Health Self-Assessment Program (MHSAP).  SecDef to expand MHSAP for continuous availability/enhanced detection, with programs to address needs of children of deployed members and families. The Mental Health Self Assessment Program includes implementation of validated mental health assessment instruments, evaluated in a population-based setting for major depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and alcohol abuse.  These assessments, scoring, referral and educational products must be provided through in-person screening events associated with National Depression, Mental Health, and Alcohol Screening days and Family Mental Health Screening days.  These same services must be provided through web-based and phone-based self-assessment tools.  Referral information must be customizable for a military community and for local military installation and community specific resources. In addition, evidence-based suicide prevention programs must be provided to expand the mental health assessment and education to adolescents in the military community (DoD and Impact Aid schools), an often over-looked but at-risk beneficiary population.  Screening for Mental Health (SMH) is a not-for-profit organization that founded, developed, and continues to administer the National Depression Day Screening (Trademark), National Mental Health Day Screening, and National Alcohol Day Screening (Trademark)  programs for the nation.  They currently provide products for over 340,000 annual screenings to over 3,600 registered organizations, including educational, healthcare, corporate, and government agencies around the country.  Unregistered participation in these screening days is even larger.  Their program has been endorsed by national professional organizations and government agencies, including SAMHSA.  SMH has been the only organization to provide broad-based mental health assessment tools and training for the conduct of National Depression, Mental Health, and Alcohol Screening Days across the nation since 1991.  If Screening for Mental Health is the vendor on this project, their possession of the copyright for National Depression Screening Day and National Alcohol Screening Day means that any DoD-wide in-person screenings should be conducted on these days of the calendar.  Otherwise, the DoDs in-person screening events would either have to be subcontracted to Screening for Mental Health by the vendor awarded the contract, because any other vendor could not legally conduct these national screening days and call them such without registering with Screening for Mental Health, Inc.  SMH is the only organization that provides a complete set of assessment instruments that have been specifically evaluated for population-based screening, scoring, and referral.  The psychometric data from their instruments has been published in the professional literature and has been applied to millions of community members, further validating the usefulness of the data produced.  The depression scale was validated through original research by the organizations director who also serves on the faculty of Harvard Medical School.  SMH provides the only evidence-based youth suicide prevention program in the nation (Signs of Suicide: SOS. They have achieved the trust of the public and professional mental health associations that ensures the products and results are used for the purpose intended.  This program is endorsed by the National Association of School Psychologists, American School Counselor Association, National Association of School Nurses, National Association of Secondary School Principals, among others.  Any firm that believes it can provide the services required is invited to submit a written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be provided in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide these services.  Information must be sent to Mr. Charles Jeff Bartlett via e-mail utilizing MS Word or .PDF File at charles.bartlett@amedd.army.mil.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Responses received will be evaluated; however; a determination  by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source Contract.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to R&D Scientific Corp., 272 Route 206 Bldg C, Flanders, NJ, on a sole source basis, a non-personal service contract to provide annual FDA certified calibration and probes of the Datatron Ext System located at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD.   R& D Scientific has proprietary rights and passwords for the system. Competing this requirement and awarding to any other source would result in substantial delays and disruption of a project already in progress and would also increase the overall cost to the Government.  This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  After the publication of this announcement for fifteen (15) days, solicitation W81XWH-09-T-0411 will be posted for three days. The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is:  Nicola.Ohaegbu@us.army.mil.

<RESPDATE>070210
<CONTACT>Tammy Lee Bair, Contract Specialist, Email tammy.bair@socom.mil - Craig Bowers, Contracting Officer, Email bowersc@socom.mil
<DESC><p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) announces interest in long-range Science and Technology (S&amp;T) projects which offer potential for advancement and improvement of Navy manned, free-flooding submersibles. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:<br />a. Vehicles compatible with the Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) on Ship, Submersible, Guided Missile, Nuclear Powered (SSGN), and Submarine, Nuclear Power (SSN) platforms.<br />b. Automatic Vehicle Control Technologies<br />c. NET-Ready capabilities<br />d. Passive and active sensors and subsystems<br />e. Navigation systems<br />f. Underwater communications, including diver-to-diver, diver-to-intermediary host, and intermediary host-to-host<br />g. Sensor masts<br />h. Other technologies that have the capacity to reduce program, schedule, or technical risks, accelerate delivery of capabilities to users, or increase user capabilities above current or projected program of record levels.</p>
<p>Teaming is encouraged. An offeror may submit more than one concept aligned with the technologies listed above. Responses are requested from any responsible organization, including those from private industry, academic institutions, research institutions and non-profit organizations. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government needs may submit a response that will be considered by USSOCOM. Small businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.</p>
<p>Work funded under this BAA may include basic research, applied research and some advanced technology development (ATD). With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, USSOCOM will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 26 June 2008. As defined therein; the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes [research performed under] grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on-campus at a university. ATD is funded through Budget Activity 3. In conformance with the USD (AT&amp;L) guidance and National Security Decision Directive 189, USSOCOM will place no restriction on the conduct or reporting of unclassified fundamental research, except as otherwise required by statue, regulation or Executive Order. Normally, fundamental research is awarded under grants with universities and under contracts with industry. ATD is normally awarded under contracts and may require restrictions during the conduct of the research and DoD pre-publication review of research results due to subject matter sensitivity. Potential offerors should consult with the appropriate PMS NSW POCs to determine whether the proposed effort would constitute basic research, applied research or ATD.</p>
<p>RESPONSES: White papers may be submitted at any time after issuance of this BAA up to the expiration date of the BAA.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS: <br />FORMAT: The form and format for white papers follows below. White papers that do not satisfy these form and format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation. All submissions should be in the English language. White papers should be submitted electronically; a paper copy is not required. Electronic copies should be in PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER PREPARATION: A white paper should be a brief summary. It introduces the idea, solicits interaction with government, and avoids the expense of generating proposals that have little likelihood of selection or award within this BAA. White papers should summarize the planned proposal and clearly articulate the innovative concept or technology development and demonstration being proposed. White papers should contain a cover sheet (clearly marked White Paper), a twenty-five (25) (maximum) summary of the technical idea, a one-page cost summary, and a one-paragraph (150-200 words) abstract of the white paper as a whole. All are invited to submit a white paper that describes the following:<br />a. The development and integration objective,<br />b. The development approach,<br />c. Related work by the investigator or offeror,<br />d. Anticipated contributions to the manned, free-flooding submersibles,<br />e. A proposed transition strategy for the nominated technology,<br />f. An estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to three years of effort, and<br />g. Proposed payment milestones and program schedule.<br />All pages should be printable on 8.5 by 11 inch paper; type not smaller than 12 point. The page limitations for white papers include all figures, tables, and charts. No formal transmittal letter is required. White papers shall not include classified information.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION WITH PROPRIETARY DATA: When an offeror must include proprietary data in order to fully communicate their concept, the offeror must clearly mark and identify any proprietary data that the offeror intends to be used only by the Government for evaluation purposes. The offeror must also identify any technical data contained in the white paper that it is furnishing to the Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure. In the absence of such identification, the Government will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data in the white paper. Records or data bearing one of the DFARS-approved restrictive legends may be included in the white paper. It is the intent of the Government to treat all white papers as privileged information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.&nbsp; Additionally, all offerors must identify any rights and restrictions that exist on their technical data, and all respondents are advised that restrictions on technology transfers outside of the U.S. will be imposed on all media created in accordance with this BAA. All offerors must also state if a technology they plan to respond to in this BAA is currently transferred to other countries / corporations outside the U.S.</p>
<p>The offerors are cautioned, however, that portions of the white papers may be subject to release under terms of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.</p>
<p>NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor, which is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by USSOCOM from non-Government consultants and experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Non-Government technical consultants will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as GOVERNMENT ONLY. Evaluations and selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators.</p>
<p>SUBMITTAL ADDRESS: All white papers should be sent electronically to: Doug Lowe at <a href="mailto:douglas.s.lowe@navy.mil">douglas.s.lowe@navy.mil</a>, with a courtesy copy to Tammy Bair, <a href="mailto:tammy.bair@socom.mil">tammy.bair@socom.mil</a>. Submissions received by USSOCOM but not submitted specifically to the BAA may not be considered under the BAA.</p>
<p>EVALUATION AND NOTIFICATION: Acknowledgment of receipt of all white papers will be made. White papers will not be returned. Evaluation will be based on the relevance to the USSOCOM mission. The initial screening will minimize unnecessary effort and expense in any subsequent proposal preparation and review. Favorable response to a white paper is not an assurance that a full proposal on the white paper's topic will ultimately be selected for contract award.</p>
<p>Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the technology objectives rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists. The following factors are to be considered in the evaluation of white papers received under this BAA. Listed in descending order of importance: 1) Relevance of the proposed objectives and technology to free-flooding manned submersibles and undersea operations; 2) Technical merits of the candidate technology as revealed by the associated proposal and transition strategy; 3) Reasonableness of the approach, given the intended operational environment and conditions; 4) Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s); 5) Availability of facilities and equipment to support the proposed effort; and 6) Cost and cost realism. All proposals must first be deemed acceptable under criteria (1) to receive a full technical review.</p>
<p><br />The BAA will remain open for submissions for one year after the initial posting date of this announcement. Submissions received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated. USSOCOM will review and respond to each white paper on a quarterly basis; however reserves to right to review and respond as submissions are submitted. Upon completion of the evaluation, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has merit and will be considered for award as funds become available, or 2) the proposal does not contain sufficient relevance to the USSOCOM mission to be of interest to the command.</p>
<p>AWARDS: An invitation to submit a full proposal will be made to offerors on the basis of the white paper evaluation criteria above and program balance to provide best value to the Government. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Award instruments may take the form of a procurement contract, grant, or agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. The Government reserves the right to 1) select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received, and 2) incrementally fund any award instrument.</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: White paper and proposal submissions in response to this BAA should be kept UNCLASSIFIED. If classified information is expected to result from any contract, the offeror shall notify USSOCOM in the white paper or proposal.</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any government technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number. Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then the offeror shall so state in the affirmation.</p>
<p>ADMINISTRATION: USSOCOM will reply to questions relating to this BAA and will make replies to questions of general interest available to prospective offerors. All correspondence including questions and requests for access to the replies to the questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to one of the addresses below. USSOCOM prefers to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding this BAA. The address for this BAA is: EMail: <a href="mailto:douglas.s.lowe@navy.mil">douglas.s.lowe@navy.mil</a>, Name: Douglas Lowe, with a courtesty copy to <a href="mailto:tammy.bair@socom.mil">tammy.bair@socom.mil</a>, Name: Tammy Bair.</p>

<p>
<p>EVALUATION OF RESPONSES:<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (National Instruments) under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Award will be conducted and evaluated under the provisions of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items, and FAR 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

Offerors must also be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database (available at: www.ccr.gov) per FAR 52.212-1.

<p>Rejection of Unrealistic Offers<br />The Government may reject any proposal/quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>

<p>Manufacturer: WichiTech Industries, Inc</p>
<p>Justification for Sole Source Only: The purchase of the HB-1 Printer Assemblies is essential for compliance with Tech Data used during metal-bond processes yielding production of quality parts. WichiTech Industries, Inc. exclusively provides the HB-1 cookers, along with all of the accessories, required to come in compliance with Tech Data. In addition, other companies' cookers would not work due to the fact that they are not interchangeable with the WichiTech heat blankets&nbsp;and cords currently in use. Other companies' cookers would have to be modified in order for the production personnel to use them with the WichiTech heat blankets. However, personnel are not authorized nor trained to make any modifications to cookers, heat blankets, or the cords. Therefore the proprietary nature of the HB-1 cooker makes WichiTech Industries the only source for HB-1 Printer Assemblies.</p>

If the past performance information is adverse, the offeror may be given an opportunity to provide a rebuttal if not previously provided such an opportunity.  <BR>     k.  The past performance proposal will be assigned a risk rating of low, moderate, high, or unknown.  An offeror whose proposal demonstrates no past performance will be rated unknown.  An award will not be made to any offeror who receives a high risk past performance rating.  The following risk assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of perceived risk and the probability of an offeror to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance.<BR>PAST PERFORMANCE RISK RATING: Low    Little doubt exists; Moderate   Some doubt exists; High   Significant doubt exists; Unkown  Little or no relevant past performance<BR>Factor 3: Subcontracting Factor (For Large Businesses Only): <BR>The Subcontracting Factor will be evaluated on a GO/NO-GO basis which will entail evaluating the offerors individaul plan to ensure tat the offeror has demonstrated their commitment to subcontract 25% of the total dollars of the resultant contract to small business.<BR>Factor 4: Mitigation Plan Factor: The Mitigation Plan, if required, of any offeror will be evlautaed on a GO/NO-GO basis to ensure that each offeror, if required, has satisfied the requirement of FAR 9 prior to the award of the contract.<BR>Factor 5: Price Factor <BR>The price factor will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness of the price proposed for this requirement.  The evaluation will be performed on the total proposed estimated price, including the base performance period, and option periods.    Discuss the basis of estimate in terms of staffing proposed for each major section of the PWS (labor categories and number of hours.<BR>     a.  Completeness:  To be complete, the offeror shall provide all the data that is necessary to support the response.  The Government will assess the extent to which the price response complies with the content and format requirements set forth in this solicitation, and also exhibits traceability of estimates. <BR>    b.  Reasonableness:  The Government will evaluate proposed prices by performing the following assessments:  reviewing labor mix for compliance with Department of Labor Wage Determination (WD) and Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), if applicable; comparing total proposed prices with those of other offerors and the Independent Government Estimate (IGE); and comparing proposed labor mix and categories, with those submitted under Technical Response.   <BR>5.  Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluations of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR>6.  Subcontracting Plan will be evaluated in accordance with AFARS Appendix DD.  An acceptable Subcontracting Plan must be in place prior to award in accordance with FAR 19.702(a)(1). Subcontracting goal for this requirement is 25%.<BR>Basis For Award<BR>1.  The Government will evaluate this requirement using a best value, lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) approach.  Tradeoffs are not permitted and no additional credit is given for exceeding acceptability.  Proposals are evaluated to determine whether they meet the acceptability levels for all evaluation factors.      <BR> 2.  The Government intends to evaluate responses and award a contract without communications with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial response should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to make clarifications or request revised responses if later determined by the Contacting Officer to be necessary.  <BR>3.  The government will evaluate the offerors technical proposal to determine whether it satisfies the requirements of the PWS and is executable as proposed.  A determination will be rendered as to whether the technical proposal is Acceptable or Unacceptable based on the definitions below. <BR>Definitions of Ratings used for LPTA:<BR>     a.  ACCEPTABLE.  Meets all specified minimum performance, capability, qualification, certification, education, and/or security requirements necessary for satisfactory order performance.  Approach is sound and executable and performance risk is low to moderate.   <BR>        b.  UNACCEPTABLE.  A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency (ies) that indicate a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach as required by the PWS that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk: and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.        <BR>

2.  Contractors are required to include a copy of the FAR provision 52.212-3-Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items and DFAR 252.212-7000-Offeror Representation and Certification-Commercial Items with its proposal or may indicate completion of the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include the certifications along with the price proposal or to complete the certifications on the internet may result in elimination from consideration for award.

FAR 13-106-2 Evaluation of Quotations or Offers.
The Government intends to evaluate quotes in response to this RFQ using the lowest price technically acceptable process.    Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes that meet or exceed the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1  Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Governments requirement and Factor 2  Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a go on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offerors past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.

Factor 1  Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Governments requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the list of Salient Characteristics included elsewhere in this solicitation.  Descriptive literature means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish that, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the list of Salient Characteristics.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2  Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offerors record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offerors adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offerors reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offerors business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
  

FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and ConditionsCommercial Items (MAR 2009)  Addenda to 52.212-4; the following clauses apply:
FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination (NOV 1991)

52.211-9  DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUN 1997)
(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:
DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE  All items within 30 days after date of contract award.
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offerors proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Governments required delivery schedule as follows:
REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE  All items within 60 days after date of contract award.
Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.
OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE:  All items within _____ days after date of contract award.
(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractors date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term working day excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a) This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld. If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) in accordance with FAR 33.103. A JCC-I/A is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The JCC-I/A Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within JCC-I/A, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the JCC-I/A Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by JCC-I/A. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following: </span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(3) An award or proposed award of the contract.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) <em>Voluntary Automatic Stay</em>. This provision describes the circumstances under which JCC-I/A voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Agency Protest, as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4).</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest. This is known as an "automatic stay" and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the GAO under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a "Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay"). However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden. This is known as an automatic stay "override."</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing. A firm may file a JCC-I/A Agency Protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agency's protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest. Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(3) The JCC-I/A voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the JCC-I/A Agency Protest Program. Should the interested party disagree with the Contracting Officer's or RCC/Division Chief's resolution of an Agency Protest, it may appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) or utilize another protest forum. The JCC-I/A Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protester's right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action. In return for the protester's initially filing its protest as an Agency Protest instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the Contracting Officer or RCC/Division Chief's decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start. This means that in an Agency Protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO. Nothing in this provision adversely affects an interested party's rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(4) However, an appeal and review of the Contracting Officer's Agency Protest decision by the PARC will not extend the GAO's timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within 10 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's Agency Protest decision.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this provision for resolution of protests.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e) For the purpose of filing a JCC-I/A Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) JCC-I/A Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from JCC-I/A, Regional Contracting Office-Taji, email: </span><a href="mailto:taji.RCC@iraq.centcom.mil"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">taji.RCC@iraq.centcom.mil</span></a><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">. <strong></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STATEMENT OF WORK:</span></strong></p>
<p>A. Overview/Background
<p>V-PROLI/NO is an analog of the promising liver-protective agent, V-PYRRO/NO, that is being investigated for its possible therapeutic value in cases of acetaminophen toxicity, fulminant liver failure, and other liver disorders. A key consideration in determining its ultimate utility in the clinical arena is its pharmacokinetic profile. The purpose of this solicitation is to commission a publishable pharmacokinetic study of V-PROLI/NO. (See Chakrapani et al, Org. Lett. 2007, 9, 3409-3412.)</p>
<p>B. Description of Work</p>
<p>Using a sample of pure V-PROLI/NO that the NCI will supply, the Subcontractor shall provide all the data necessary to coauthor a report in a peer-reviewed journal in collaboration with the providers of the test substance that will include a full pharmacokinetic profile of this compound.</p>
<p>The Subcontractor shall develop and validate methods for assaying V-PROLI/NO in blood. Using methods completely consistent with animal welfare procedures approved by the NIH, administer V-PROLI/NO both intravenously, intraperitoneally, and orally to mice. Assay blood samples taken periodically, then convert the analytical data to the full set of pharmacokinetic parameters required for the desired publication, including at least clearance, Cmax, Tmax, AUC, distribution and metabolism half-lives via each route, and oral and intraperitoneal bioavailability.</p>
<p>C. Project Requirements and Deliverables</p>
<p>Subcontractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>The amount of V-PROLI/NO the Subcontractor believes is necessary to perform the assays, as well as the quantity of mice needed.</p>
<p>All tables and graphs necessary for a definitive publication describing the results, plus a full description of methods used for assay development, validation, and pharmacokinetics for inclusion in the Experimental section, and a narrative explaining the tables and graphs to be used in the Results section of the paper.</p>
<p>Subcontractor will submit a firm, fixed-price proposal in US Dollars (USD $) to perform the work description and provide the deliverables noted above, including a project schedule.</p>
<p>D. Additional Requirements</p>
<p>The Subcontractor shall provide all documentation including the results of the project as stated in this SOW in English, and in both printed &amp; electronic formats.</p>
<p>E. Advanced Understandings</p>
<p>Unless specifically directed in writing by the SAIC-F Contracting Officer, any government furnished material including but not limited to biological organisms, material, compositions, and substances ("Material") provided hereunder, shall be used by the subcontractor solely in connection with the performance of the work as delineated in the Statement of Work (SOW). The Material may be subject of an invention report, patent application, or IND submission and therefore the Subcontractor agrees not to disclose any information about the Material or transfer the Material to any third party without the prior written permission of the SAIC-F Contracting Officer. After the conclusion of the work authorized under the Subcontracting Agreement, the Material (including any improvements to, or modified derivatives of) will be disposed of by the Subcontractor as directed by the SAIC-F Contracting Officer. Patent Rights and Rights in Data will be governed by the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations incorporated herein.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI9106 issued as a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC2005-33. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, which has a size standard of 500. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intend to procure laboratory instruments on a sole source basis from Roche Diagnostics Corp as follows: 1) 03051315001 COBAS AmpliPrep Instrument, qty-1; and 2) 03279332692 COBAS TaqMan 48 Analyzer-qty-1. These instruments automate laboratory procedures that have been manually done for the past 10 years. They can utilize the same reagents, which are patented by Roche, that have previously been used in longitudinal studies. Two on-going clinical trials have utilized reagents from Roche Diagnostics Corp in conjunction with manual assay kits. The same formulations can be used with the above analyzers. This is important for on-going studies and clinical trials as any introduction of variables makes research data unusable. Each reagent has a bar code that is confirmed by the instrument. These instruments can facilitate the process of generating data as they can handle multiple specimens automatically 24 hours a day. No other known instrument can be used to process specimens in the lab due to the fact that the same reagents must be used for on-going clinical trials and research projects. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) price and 2) capability to meet required specifications. Delivery will be made to Bethesda, MD, 20892. The FOB point shall be Destination.

It is the responsibility of the offerors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render an offer not to be accepted by the Government. 
SECTION B: ******************************************************************************
FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial ItemsNOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.
Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 None;
SECTION C: ******************************************************************************FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.  
     (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE    (ii)  PRICE
(b)  Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iii), PRICE.  
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   
(c)  By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  
(d)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 
Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(f)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Description
Full Architectural-Engineering design services for a term contract throughout the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia and the states of Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, and the Southern counties of New Jersey from Trenton south.  It is the intent of this announcement to award a term contract to a single firm.  

Projects will involve Repair and Alterations, Renovations and Modernization of federal facilities and required Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, energy-related projects, projects involving sustainable design concepts, Security, and Interior Design services with sensitivity towards historic buildings.  This contract will be utilized to specifically address the requirements of the Judiciary and Law Enforcement Agencies.  In addition, design and engineering services for any federal agency may be performed under this contract at the discretion of the government.  The selected firm will be required to ensure that projects meet any applicable agency comprehensive programming and design criteria, including but not limited to the U.S. Courts Design Guide 2007 and 2005 Facilities Standard (P100), which are both available at www.gsa.gov.  This procurement will result in an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity term contract.  The work stated above may involve multiple task orders to be done concurrently within the geographical area as stated above.  

Firms that demonstrate they are capable of providing at least 35% overall design services from an office within the Commonwealths of Virginia and Pennsylvania, the states of Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia and the 13 Southern counties of New Jersey (from Trenton south), and the District of Columbia may be rated more favorably. THE A/E OF RECORD HAS UP TO 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER AWARD OF THE CONTRACT TO ESTABLISH A PRODUCTION CAPABILITY WITHIN THE GENERAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

GSA is committed to excellence in design. Projects under this contract are for repair and alteration work in federal facilities and will generally be for projects up to $5 million in construction costs. Most projects will also involve occupied buildings, many of which are historically significant.  The scope of architectural and engineering services under this proposed contract include, but are not limited to the following: programming; pre-design; the preparation of feasibility studies; the preparation of Request for Proposal packages for Design-Build projects; site investigation; complete design services (space planning, interior design, architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, civil, structural, fire protection, vertical transportation, life safety, security, historical, and code compliance); cost estimating; building commissioning; procurement support; post-construction-award services; and other related supplemental services if so requested by the Government.

Hazardous materials such as incidental asbestos and lead may be encountered in existing facilities. The A/E's Industrial Hygienist will be required to identify and quantify the types and locations of hazardous materials that may be abated during construction and will be required to provide abatement recommendations. Furthermore, knowledge of airborne pathogen concerns is required. 

In addition, projects may be designed and constructed in metric, System International (SI) units in accordance with Public Law 100-576, the Omnibus Trade & Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Metric Conversion Act, and Executive Order 12770. 

GSA CAD Deliverables Policy and Drawing Analysis Program (DAP) will be incorporated as requirements into the awarded contract.  The DAP is a software utility that generates reports (both tabular and graphical) that are used to aid in the identification of some (but not all) GSA CAD standards compliance issues.  The utility is an aid to compliance, but is not guaranteed to work in all versions of AutoCAD or any other product, and does not make drawings compliant to enumerate all issues of noncompliance.  The party responsible for producing the drawings is ultimately responsible for compliance with the GSA policy.  The Detailed CAD Deliverable Policy may be accessed on the internet at http://www.gsa.gov/midatlanticcadpolicy. The contractor agrees that all CAD, AutoCad drawings and related files, photographs, drawings, renderings, blueprints, specifications and/or other materials generated for use by the contractor on the project, whether in machine readable form or not, shall belong at all times to the General Services Administration (GSA) and shall be delivered to
GSA at the times specified and within the schedules contained in the Agreement or at the termination of the Agreement, whichever occurs first. 

THE QUALIFICATIONS-BASED EVALUATION CRITERIA TO BE APPLIED IN THE SELECTION PROCESS IN DESCENDING ORDER OF IMPORTANCE ARE AS FOLLOWS:

1) CRITERIA 1 - SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE.  Recent experience of the design team members individually and collectively as a total team in the type of work required or evidence of similar relevant experience (as described above) and in designing and providing construction documents to Judicial, Law Enforcement, and other federal agencies criteria and in experience in sustainable design, use of the U.S. Green Building Council LEED System including descriptions of waste reduction techniques and energy efficiency in facilities designed by the team, and familiarity with use of recovered materials on construction contracts per FAR 52.223-9.
Submission Requirements: The firm will provide, on the SF 330, Part I, Item F(24), a detailed narrative of up to 5 relevant projects completed within the last Five (5) Years that best illustrate overall team experience relevant to this contract scope.

Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.  The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.


SELECTION INVTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS:

Personal interviews will be scheduled for firms slated as most highly qualified.  Firms slated for interviews will be asked to explain management and design team components, quality control (QC) process; and to provide design solutions to actual/hypothetical projects, a draft small businesses subcontracting plan, etc.  Elaborate presentations are not desired.

Site visits will not be arranged during this period.  Debriefing request will not be entertained prior to 45 days after the submittal due date.  It is the Governments intent to incorporate Look-up Tables into the contract as a mandatory payment provision.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

EUCOM is in the process of establishing a DoD civilian billet to perform these tasks, but there will be a gap between the expiration of the current contract and the establishment of the new position due to timelines required for processing and approving a DoD civilian billet.  This proposed sole source contract would continue performance of the required services until the civilian position is approved and filled. 


Justification 
1. Contracting Agency and Activity. 
Office of the Secretary of Defense for Policy

2. Nature of Action Being Approved. 
Caspian Maritime Security Coordinator

3. Description of Supplies or Services. 
The non-personal services to be rendered under this contract call for an Integrating Contractor (hereinafter Caspian Maritime Security Coordinator) to provide day-to-day support and coordination of Caspian maritime security cooperation.  This coordination will consist of facilitating the implementation of a coordinated Caspian maritime security approach across USG service providers, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), other DoD agencies, select littoral state country teams and, once the implementation of projects begins, providing monitoring and coordination of Caspian maritime security-related programs to U.S. European Command, U.S. Central Command, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia Policy, and the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Central Asia Policy.

4. Estimated Dollar Value. 
The value of the anticipated procurement will not exceed $500,000. 

5. Statutory Authority. 
The Statutory Authority for this requirement is FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The required service will be procured under a short-term, follow-on, bridge contract.  This bridge period is anticipated to be 18 months, which will cover the period between expiration of the current contract, and assignment of a Government hire to continue permanent performance. 
 
6. Rationale Supporting Use of Citation Above.
Continuing services from the original source is the most efficient and cost-effective approach for this short-term, follow-on requirement.  

7. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 
U.S. European Command Strategy, Policy, and Assessments Directorate (EUCOM J5) currently has a contract that provides services to coordinate and manage maritime security on the Caspian Sea.  That contract with options ends on 31 Aug 09.  EUCOM is in the process of establishing a DoD civilian billet to perform these tasks, but there will be a gap between the expiration of the current contract and the establishment of the new position due to timelines required for processing and approving a DoD civilian billet.  This proposed sole source contract would continue performance of the required services until the civilian position is approved and filled.  

Justification for the sole source is as follows:
- Provides for continuity and quality of performance over the abbreviated bridge period.  
- Given the short 18 month period of performance, there is insufficient time for a new contractor to ascend the learning curve required to ensure successful contract performance under the anticipated requirement.  As a result, the Government does not expect to recover the duplication of costs that would result through competition of this action and possible award to a new source.  For these reasons, award of a follow-on contract to the incumbent source until a DoD civilian is hired is the most cost effective approach for fulfilling this short-term requirement. 

8. Efforts to Identify Additional Sources. 
None.

9. Future Plans to Permit Competition. 
This service will be performed by a DoD civilian in the future; no further contract is envisioned at this time.

10. Recommendation and Certification 
"Based on the above, I recommend this acquisition be conducted on the basis of other than full and open competition. I certify that technical data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel and which form a basis for the justification are complete and accurate."

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to share questions and answer from vendors and the NIST End-User regarding the De-Ionized (DI) Water System SB1341-09-RQ-0343:

1st Vendors Questions:

1 - Can a site visit be scheduled in order to see the current setup and space / utilities available where the new system is going?

Requests for visitation can be arranged for those Contractors who are 
seriously considering fulfilling this request. In accordance, the 
Contractor must submit documentation demonstrating their proposed DI 
water system can meet the minimum system requirements prior to arranging 
a visitation.

2 - The existing system demolition and removal is not specified in 
this solicitation. Will it be performed by NIST personnel?

The old, inoperable DI water system is not located in the space where 
the new system will be place. Therefore, Removal and Disposal of the old 
DI water system is NOT included in the quotation. Such operations will 
be handled by NIST at a later date.

3 - What is the existing building automation system protocol that you 
are using that the new system will hook into to provide remote 
monitoring and alarm capabilities? (MOD bus. BACnet, LON, etc}

We are NOT looking to hook into the Building Alarm system. The Remote 
monitoring/alarm system should be, at minimum, an integrated I/O system 
that is present in the DI water system. The I/O system should interface 
directly with a basic PC computer system or IP. The alarms should be 
easily programmed to send, at least, e-mail alerts to the monitoring 
parties. The system should be able to be queried to send minor reports 
on such attributes as water quality, cartridge quality (if applicable), 
etc.

2nd Vendors question:

1 - Can we get a water analysis to determine the special needs for 
 pretreatment before the key water purification equipment?


The Water supply is Gaithersburg City Tap water, which is handled by 
Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. Water quality information is 
posted here: http://www.wsscwater.com/info/QandA.cfm


3rd Vendor question:

As per this solicitation the request is for the system line items 
only. Does the RFQ require removal, installation and commissioning 
start-up also?

The request DOES NOT require the Contractor to remove the old DI water 
service unit. The request DOES require the installation of the DI water 
system pending the properly supplied connections provided by the NIST 
Plant Division. The entire quotation should include the cost of the DI 
water unit and all commissioning/services fees.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment notice is to extend the due date for receipt of proposals to July 7, 2009, 3:00 PM, EST, and to respond to questions received from potential offerors as follows:

Q1.  Will UPS/FedEx/commercial courier agents be permitted to pass through building security and make deliveries anywhere internally within the NRC headquarters complex?

A1.  No; NRC facilities are controlled-accessed.

Q2.  Will UPS/FedEx/commercial courier be required to deliver to the mail room?

A2.  Yes; the NRC mail room is the designated point of delivery.

Q3.  If a UPS/FedEx/other commercial courier is used for delivering material, what provision is there for reimbursement to the contractor for waiting time incurred by driver/delivery person due to building security delays, absence of receiving personnel, etc.?

A3.  There is no provision to pay for the time it takes for delivery.  

Q4.  Will the delivery person have to go through building security each day and then wait for an escort up to the specified internal delivery point in order to complete timely delivery by 8:30am?

A4.  No; delivery to the NRC mail room is sufficient.

Q5.  Will NRC have someone waiting at 8:30am to accept packages or will the delivery person have to pass through building security in order to complete deliveries?

A5.  See A4.

Q6.  Will NRC require hand delivery by the contractor or by a commercial courier or other hand delivery means?

A6.  No; hand delivery can be delivery by a contractor employee, or someone such as a commercial courier that the contractor uses to make the delivery.

Q7.  Given the nature of the level of security at NRC headquarters, is it customary for the reporter to be escorted at all times within any building?

A7.  Yes.

Q8.  When reporters arrive at NRC headquarters complex (and other NRC facilities), how much time should be allowed for passing through building security and being escorted to the appropriate meeting room?

A8.  Approximately, fifteen to thirty minutes.

Q9.  Since NRC has indicated its intent herewith to post electronic versions of court-reporter-attended proceedings on its website for free public access, will participants and other interested persons not have to pay the contractor for official transcripts?

A9.  They wont have to, but if they want to buy one, they certainly can.  In some cases the participants may still want to purchase transcripts directly from the contractor for expedience. 

Q10.  What proportion of transcription of videos/cassettes/CDs is permitted for sale to the public or other third parties?

A10.  This is an unknown and can only be evaluated on a case by case basis.  Also, see A9.

Q11.  Will NRC provide at no cost to the contractor all software and IT operating programs required to be utilized for encryption/un-encryption of audio and text files or are these expenses to be incurred by the contractor?

A11.  Offerors should propose all costs that it deems are necessary in meeting the requirements of this solicitation. 

Q12.  When encryption/un-encryption is required for electronic transfer of audio and text files between NRC user offices and the contractor, what provision is made for compensation for staff/personnel training and operating time, software ownership/updates, etc. and other contractor incurred expenses both at current volume of services performed and at expected future expanded volumes of required services?

A12.  See A11.

Q13.  Will NRC provide at no cost to the contractor the software and training to comply with the time-coded ASCII requirements as specified in this contract?

A13.  See A.11. 

Q14.  If not, what provision is made to compensate the contractor for personnel time spent in preparation and training for the unique and special aspects of time-coded ASCII as required by NRC?

A14.  See A11.

Q15.  Further, is the contractor to be compensated in any way for ongoing costs associated with both present levels and future expected expanded levels of time-coded ASCII transcripts?

A15.  See A11.

Q16.  What provision is made for compensation to the contractor for new technologies adopted by NRC and required to be utilized by the contractor?

A16.  Within scope changes to the resultant contract would be handled pursuant with the Changes clause.

Q17.  On the pricing schedule, deliveries are indicated 10 day, 7 day, 3 day, etc.; does this use of the word day refer to business days or calendar days?

A17.  Business days.

Q18.  Do any users of the contract have the authority to require or request any special binding materials for the transcript deliverables?

A18.  Yes, it will be as indicated on the work order request.  (For example, there is an occasional request for spiral binding on a minuscript copy.)
	
Q19.  What provision is made for compensating the contractor for providing Spanish speaking court reporters and/or transcribers?

A.19.  There is no extra compensation for this; it is a rare occurrence, happening on average twice per year.

Q20.  Will all official verbatim proceedings which involve a Spanish speaking court reporter or spoken Spanish language require the record to be translated in to English, into Spanish or both?

A20.  English only.

Q21.  What provision is made for additional compensation to the contractor for reporting and transcribing the extremely technical content of the numerous and frequent NRC proceedings in which the discussion is conducted in heavily accented English and spoken by people for whom English is not their primary language? 

A21.  No additional compensation.

Q22.  Has NRC, consistent with similar patterns elsewhere, adopted the practice of having witnesses submit direct testimony in writing for inclusion in to the official record of hearings, which is referred to as Pre-filed Testimony?

A22.  It may be writing or, some other format as on a CD, however it is submitted, it is to be included in the transcript when so directed.  Pre-filed testimony is submitted ahead of the hearing, but sometimes there are changes made to the actual testimony when it is accepted into the record on the day of the hearing(s).

Q23.  Does this result in shorter hearing duration on-the-record?

A23.  It could result in a shorter hearing duration.

Q24.  Despite having shorter on-the-record proceedings is the contractor required to include these witnesses pre-filed testimony in the official transcript instead of being paid for the pages of verbatim court reporting to capture this testimony?

A24.  If it is read into the record, it has the normal compensation.  If it is added to the record after the fact in paper or, some other form, and copies are made, the copies are paid at the page rate as designated (in the contract) for copies.

Q25.  Will additional time be allowed to the contractor for delivery of transcripts of proceedings (or portions thereof) that occur during non-regular hours?

A25.  If a proceeding lasts past 6:00 p.m. local time, an additional day will be allowed for the delivery of the portion that occurs after 6:00 p.m.  An exception is in the case of an onsite hearing, etc., requiring next day delivery.

Q26.  Will the NRC reimburse the contractor for travel expenses for the frequently remote locations requiring a court reporter?

A26.  Offerors should propose all costs that it deems are necessary in meeting the requirements of this solicitation.

Q27.  Are copies, as listed on the pricing schedule, for internal NRC use or are they distributed to other government agencies or to third parties?

A27.  NRC use.

Q28.  Section 4.3 indicates that the contractor shall provide a Spanish speaking reporter/transcriber when necessary.  If a Spanish speaking reporter/transcriber is required, will the proceedings be conducted entirely in Spanish or will an interpreter be present?

A.28.  An interpreter may or, may not be present.  The interviewee usually understands the questions, but may not know English well enough to be able to answer in English. 

Q29.  If a reporter is required to travel for classified work, will the NRC pay for the cost of travel?

A29.  See A11.

Q30.  Will the NRC consider price/cost schedules in a format other than the one provided?

A30.  See A11.

Q31.  Will more than one proceeding be held simultaneously at different multiple locations throughout the United States?

A30.  Yes, it is so stated in the statement of work under Background.

Q32.  Is additional compensation available to the contractor when an order for services is placed within 4 hours of the scheduled start time?

A32.  No.

<CONTACT>Jim McNulty, 267-3626

<a href="mailto:jim.mcnulty@faa.gov">jim.mcnulty@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>AMENDMENT 2 - The Market Research Announcement is hereby amended on July 2, 2009, to address a requeset to extend the due date for responses.  Due to schedule constraints and other planned market analysis activities, the FAA would prefer to receive responses to this announcement on or before July 9, 2009.  However, the FAA will accpet responses as late as Monday morning, July 13, 2009.
AMENDMENT 1 - The Market Research Announcement is hereby amended on July 1, 2009, to post the FAA's responses to the questions received from industry relative to this potential requirement.  The questions along with the FAA's responses are provided as an attachment.  We look forward to receiving responses from industry for this market research announcement on or before July 9, 2009.  Please note that the correct e-mail address for Giles Strickler is:  Giles.D.Strickler@faa.gov  
ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT LANGUAGE:  In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1, FAA is conducting market research to improve the Agency's understanding of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) systems that may be able to satisfy all, or a portion, of the FAA's requirements for a Unified Contracting System (UCS).  The FAA is also interested in receiving information on specially developed solutions for similar requirements (relative to automation of government contracting processes).  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP).  Any information provided in response to this announcement will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if properly marked.  Participation is not a promise of future business with FAA, and costs associated with any submission to FAA are solely at the interested vendor's expense.   
In an effort to improve FAA's ability to procure items in the most effective and efficient manner possible, FAA is researching the market for systems that can support the FAA procurement life-cycle.  Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
	Electronic Procurement/Contracting with electronic/digital signature	Automated Role-based workflow	Interface capability with other systems, to include procurement/accounting systems	Routing capability/business process automation	Information sharing/collaboration (for both internal and external users)	Electronic document management	Reporting and metrics	Ability to be tailored to FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS)
Attached to this announcement is a draft System Boundary Document (SBD) outlining the basic requirements of the FAA for the Unified Contracting System (UCS).
Responses to this market survey must be received by COB Thursday July 9, 2009.  All submittals must be sent via e-mail to Jim McNulty, at Jim.McNulty@faa.gov and must include the following information:  
	Vendor Information:o	Name of Companyo	Addresso	Phone and Fax Numbero	Point of Contacto	E-mail Addresso	Business Size Status (e.g. SEDB/8(a), Small Business, SDVOSB, Other than Small)	A written summary of the Commercial, Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products you have that meet the requirements in the draft SBD, and to what degree the COTS products actually meet the stated requirements as defined in the draft SBD (Limit to 10 pages).	Available commercial pricing and licensing structure information for the COTS software product(s) that meet the UCS requirements as defined in the draft SBD.  	A list of five government customers for whom you have deployed the commercial product(s) including the name of the agency, name of a specific point of contact (POC) for each customer, phone number (for each customer POC), and e-mail address (for each customer POC).  	A written summary of any specially developed system (or solution) relative to automation of a government agency's contracting processes and systems and how that relates to the FAA's requirement (as described in the draft System Boundary Document).  	Detailed description of system architecture and hardware platform requirements to deploy the cited COTS software products (or specially developed solution) to meet the UCS requirements defined in the draft SBD.  	Any written comments and recommendations on the draft SBD itself (Limit 5 pages).
FAA will formally respond to questions for this market research announcement.  Please submit all questions via e-mail to Giles Strickler at Giles.D.Strickler@faa.gov (with a cc copy to Jim McNulty at Jim.McNulty@faa.gov).  Questions must be submitted on or before COB Tuesday June 23, 2009.  The FAA will publish questions along with the FAA's responses.   The FAA will endeavor to have the questions and FAA's responses posted on or before Tuesday June 30, 2009.  An "Interested Vendor List" will be published upon completion of the market research announcement period and will also be published with the actual Screening Information Request (SIR) should the FAA decide to pursue a SIR for this requirement.  
For the purpose of supporting potential teaming and subcontracting, the FAA plans to publish the list of companies (and products) that respond to this market research announcement.  For ease of reference, we shall refer to this as the "Interested Vendors List."  Respondents to this announcement must indicate in their response if they do NOT want the name of their company (and product and POC data) published in the List of Interested Vendors.  
The FAA is in the market research phase for this requirement.  As such, the FAA reserves the right to contact some, all, or none of the respondents to this announcement to obtain additional information regarding the commercial products described in the responses.  
At this stage of the process, the FAA is not fully cognizant of the different COTS products that can satisfy this requirement.  That is the primary reason for this announcement (to gain further knowledge in that regard).  At this juncture, however, we are unsure of the amount of integration and "modifications" to COTS products that may be required to meet this requirement.  For that reason, the System Boundary Document (SBD) describes some practices that may be considered more closely related to a developmental or major system contract.  The FAA will make decisions on those issues before a SIR is actually issued (if the decision is made to issue a SIR for this requirement).

<DESC>** July 2, 2009 update:  Amendment 3 and final Q&A's are posted.  Due date extended until July 16, 2009.
** June 24, 2009 update:  Amendment 2, Q & A's are posted.
** June 16, 2009 update:  Amendment 1 extending due date is posted **
The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking to establish an effort to cost share, on a 1:1 minimum basis, development of continuous lower energy, emissions and noise (CLEEN) technologies for civil subsonic jet airplanes to help achieve the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) goals to increase airspace system capacity by reducing significant community noise and air quality emissions impacts in absolute terms and limit or reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions impacts on the global climate.  The CLEEN program is focused on reducing current levels of aircraft noise, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use, and advancing alternative fuels for aviation use.  The focus of this effort is to: (1) mature previously conceived noise, emissions and fuel burn reduction technologies from Technology Readiness Levels  (TRLs) of 3-4 to TRLs of 6-7 to enable industry to expedite introduction of these technologies into current and future aircraft and engines, and (2) assess the benefits and advance the development and introduction of alternative "drop in" fuels for aviation, with particular focus on renewable options, including blends.

<DESC>The following information serves as Amendment # 1 to Sources Sought Solicitation FTA-09-0529.  The questions and answers posted below have come in as a result of the initial posting and ALL REMAINING QUESTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL TO CHANEL.WINSTON@DOT.GOV NO LATER THAN 12 NOON, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 2009.  

A second amendment will be posted with the remaining questions and answers on Tuesday, July 7, 2009.

Lastly, PLEASE NOTE THAT A VENDORS LIST WILL NOT BE COMPILED AS A RESULT OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT.  Therefore, if your firm is interested in responding to this notice, please submit your Capabilities Statement as detailed within the solicitation.

==================================================================
1) The specific requirement for this Sources Sought is that the respondent be a small business in order to be considered.  The applicant would be bringing on as a teaming partner, a subcontractor with both a MOBIS and an IT 70 contract - and though the sub is currently under $15M in size, they are above the small business limit for the 541611 NAICS.  Could you advise if this type of relationship is eligible for consideration?  
 
Subcontractors do not have to be small businesses. However, be aware that the prime contractor must do at least 51% of the billable work.
 
2) Is the master's degree a firm requirement in the job description or can experience in lieu of education be substituted?
 
Experience can be substituted for the Masters degree.  Applicant must, however, have a bachelors degree in a related field.
 
3) Is the overall scope of this effort concerning performance management of IT Applications and systems or performance management.  Performance management is also a term used in business to describe things like financial performance.
 
Yes. The overall objective here is to implement an IT system to support performance management.  Potential contractors will need to demonstrate expertise in performance management first, and the ability to understand the limitations and capabilities of IT systems second.  We are looking for a team that can do both.

FTA collects data on program outcomes and outputs to meet DOT requirements and for internal performance improvement purposes.  For example, we measure how long it takes us to issue grants (our goal is to average less than 36 days) because we once had complaints that it took too long.  We also count the number of rides people take on transit systems around the country (we have a goal to increase this by at least 1.5% per year).  We have around 20 measures of things like that, with the data being collected in different systems around the agency.  Some may involve financial performance (responding to audits) or be safety related (injuries and fatalities).  This is performance management in its broadest sense.  We collect the data manually now and would like to automate the collection and display to save time.

4) Is this sources sought a follow-on from a related contract.  If so, would you be able to provide the contractor, contract #, and contract value. 
 
This is a new activity and is unlike previous procurements, thus the sources sought notice.
 
5) Will the eventual RFP (if any) come out under a MOBIS vehicle?  I ask because at your $7M size standard requirement, our small business is only qualified to bid if it is a MOBIS based competition.   
 
We are not sure of our procurement strategy at this point.  If we choose to use the GSA list it will be a MOBIS vehicle.  If we decide we can use a disadvantaged small business, we will not need to designate it as MOBIS. 
 

6) Would it be possible to understand what current software packages are already in place to build the performance management portal?  Or is that purchase part of the eventual solicitation?
 
We currently call the database owner who queries his data system and emails us the results. We paste it into an Excel chart and then into a Word document which gets converted to Adobe format and posted on our intranet.  Data originally comes from TEAM, OTrack, and the National Transit Database (an Oracle application).
 
7) Is this requirement self-generated by FTA or did a vendor or consultant recommend FTA take this course of action?  

Self-generated

8) Would the FTA program manager or CO allow us to come in and make a presentation?

No.  If you are interested in presenting your firm, please submit a Capabilities Statement.


9) Is there a specific schedule for how the FTA will determine if it proceeds with an RFP or RFQ?

No.  How we proceed depends on the nature of the responses.

10) Would the FTA consider using GSA MOBIS as the contracting vehicle for this study and advice?

Yes, if we identify providers in this process that are on the GSA MOBIS schedule and determine that procurement by this vehicle provides the best value to the government.
 
11) Does FTA plan on distributing tasks 1 and 2 as separate solicitations? (b) If FTA does anticipate releasing two separate solicitations, will there be any conflict of interest issues regarding implementing both tasks? 

Yes. We expect to issue two separate solicitations, one to develop a plan for the data collection and display system and another to implement and pilot the system.  To insure objectivity in the planning process we will not select the same contractor for both solicitations.  FTA will prepare initial requirements and purchase necessary software licenses.  We are looking for qualified small businesses to bid on both solicitations.

<DESC>This project consists of replacing an existing 62 x 72 x 40 arch pipe with a government supplied timber bridge with timber abutments.  The existing culvert passes Gypsum Creek under the Middle Gypsum road.  The bridge is 16 feet wide with a 28 foot span and 10 foot rise.  A second requirement of the project will consist of removing and disposing of an existing 50 diameter culvert and 15 diameter steel pipe and replacing them with a government supplied treated timber bridge with timber abutments.  The existing culvert and pipe pass Tepee Creek under the Kinky Creek Road.  The new bridge is 16 wide with a 28 span and 10 rise.  Both new bridges are currently located at the Pinedale Ranger District upper yard, 10 Favazzo Subdivision Road, Pinedale, Wyoming for pickup.  This project also includes hauling and placing approximately 278 cubic yards of local pit run material for 500 feet on the west approach to the new bridge.  

The contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, tools, supervision supplies, materials and quality control necessary to divert the existing creek, remove the existing culvert, construct the bridge, shape and compact the approaches and roadway, and pave the bridge and approcahes per the drawings and specifications.      

The project is located on the Pinedale Ranger District, Bridger-Teton National Forest, Sublette County, Wyoming.  The contract will be 60 calendar days.  Offers are due at 3:00 p.m. MST, May 13, 2009.  The estimated price range is between $100,000 and $150,000.  A previous pre-bid meeting was held for this project last fall at which time we visited the project site.  Since the site will most likely be snowed in now, another pre-bid meeting will be held on April 21, 2009 to show photos of the site and answer any questions from prospective offerors that were not able to attend the meeting last fall.  PROPECTIVE OFFERORS SHALL MEET AT THE PINEDALE RANGER DISTRICT, 29 EAST FREMONT LAKE ROAD, PINEDALEM, WYOMING AT 11:00 ON TUESDAY, APRIL 21, 2009 FOR THE PRE-BID MEETING.

The solicitation will be available on approximately April 13, 2009, and can be downloaded from this site at that time.  All responsible vendors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  The proposed project listed here is a HUBZone set-aside.

<p>Preparation of the Report on Carcinogens</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type of Requirement</p>
<p>Re-competition&nbsp; (Contact No.N01-ES-35505)</p>
<p><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small business; 8(a) small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712 for the proposed acquisition for which the small business size standard is 500 employees.  Responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is requesting information to determine the availability of interested businesses to compete for a contract that will provide support for the preparation of the Report on Carcinogens (RoC) and the background documents used in its scientific review process. The RoC is a Congressionally mandated document that identifies and discusses agents, substances, mixtures, or exposure circumstances (collectively referred to as "substances") that may pose a hazard to human health by virtue of their carcinogenicity.  The responsibility for preparing the RoC has been delegated to the National Toxicology Program. (NTP). Substances that are being considered by the NTP for possible listing or de-listing in the RoC (here referred to as candidate substances) are evaluated by a rigorous review process. Each background document summarizes all relevant exposure, regulatory and carcinogenicity information specific for a candidate substance. The goal of this contract is to provide support of NTP hazard identification activities targeted toward the prevention of diseases or adverse effects caused by environmental exposure to chemical or physical agents.</p>
<p><br />The propose contract tasks include: the preparation of the background documents and the preparation of the RoC. Both shall be measured by end products.   The Contractor shall conduct literature searches, draft technical summaries or reviews of the literature in textual and/or tabular format, checks the technical accuracy of the information, performs copy and scientific editing, and formats and compiles the information into a background document.  For some background documents, the Contractor may need to establish subcontracts with expert consultants (identified by the NTP RoC office) to draft or provide advice for sections in which the Contractor does not have adequate expertise.  The preparation of the background document project has two types of end products associated with it; the preparation of the final background documents (average 5 per year) and administrative support for the expert panel meetings (approximately 4 per year). The preparation of the RoC task requires the production of one type of end product; the RoC pre-publication draft.  Section 508 compliance will be applicable.</p>
<p>Task 1: Requires the completion of two types of end products, each of which represents a different step or subtask.  These two end products include:</p>
<p>1) Preparation and delivery of the expert panel drafts and the final background document (average 5 candidate substances per year) - (End product type 1).</p>
<p>2) Administrative support for the expert panel meetings (average 4 per year) - (End product type 2).</p>
<p>Task 2: Requires the preparation and delivery of the pre-publication draft of the RoC (estimated not to exceed 3 per the entire contract) - (End product type 3)</p>
<p>The RoC is a compilation of substance profiles that describe the carcinogenicity, exposure and regulatory information for each listing, relevant tables, appendices, indexes and supporting documents.  The preparation of the RoC, which is the final end product, shall be completed in three phases or sub-tasks.</p>
<p>1) Preparation of substance profiles for new listings<br />2) Updating substance profiles for current listings<br />3) Preparation of the preliminary and pre-publication drafts.</p>
<p>Interested organizations should submit five (5) copies of their capability statement, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages in length, excluding resumes and standard brochures, for receipt by the agency by 4:00 p.m. ET on July 17, 2009.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this sources sought synopsis.</p>

____________________________6/11/09Amendment 1:  Answers to Questions
1)I have a quick question regarding notice # N40085-09-R-0206, and I was hoping that you could help me.  By any chance is this requirement a follow-on to contract # N40085-05-R-1005?  This requirement is not a follow-on contract.
2) Is there a page limit for the SF 330 submittal?  No.
3)  Can you please confirm that the due date for submittals is July 10, 2009?  Within the text of the solicitation (bottom of page 3) it states that all responses are due by May 30, 2008.  The synopsis has been revised to read the correct date, submittals are due July 10, 2009 at 2:00 p.m.
____________________________6/22/2009Amendment 2:  Answers to Questions
4)In the evaluation Factor #4, it requires an explanation on the company's ability to perform 5 taskings simultaneously. Could you please clarify the work load each tasking would entail.  In other words, what is the assigned value of each task order. For the purposes of this evaluation factor, use a task order range of $15,000 to $150,000 to estimate the workload.
5)I am writing to inquire about the IDIQ for A/E Services for Projects at Military Installations in the NAVFAC Midlant Public Works Department Little Creek and Oceana Areas?  Is cost estimating considered a part of the team?  Yes.
____________________________6/24/2009Amendment 3:  Answers to Questions
6)The Solicitation indicates the NAICS Code 541310 - Architectural Services.  Our Firm carries Code 541330 - Engineering Services.  Does this difference in the NAICS Code hinder us from submitting our SF 330?  No it does not.  You are still eligible to submit your SF 330 for this procurement.


____________________________6/30/2009Amendment 4:  Answers to Questions
7)Does the prime need to contract for 50% of the contract dollars? Pursuant to FAR Part 19, at least 50 percent of the contract cost must be performed by the prime contractor's own employees. 
8)If we need to, but can't reach 50% as prime, can other small businesses on the contract like structural and civil count toward getting there?  Refer to previous question.
9)If other small businesses can't count, can we create a joint-venture?  You may create a joint venture.
10)Can the joint-venture be finalized after award, or does it need to be existing?  The joint venture must be in place prior to submission of your proposal for evaluation purposes.
11)When doing a joint-venture, does the small business cap look at each firm's revenue independently, or does it total them?	Refer to FAR Part 19.101 for determining the size standard.
12)Can the Organizational Chart be submitted on a single 11 x 17 fold-out?  It is difficult to get the org chart to fit on 8.5 x 11 and stay readable.  Yes.
____________________________7/02/2009Amendment 5:  Answers to Questions
13)With regards to the projects highlighted in section F, do we need to show a single project or can we show an IDIQ contract with the various tasks listed?  Provide example projects which best illustrate the proposed team's qualifications for this contract.  Task Orders from an IDIQ contract are acceptable.
14)Please help me understand one requirement stated in the solicitation.  The text reads as follows:  Provide evidence that your firm is permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering, i.e., State registration number.  Are you asking for Virginia State registration number, or a State registration number in the State where we have our office?  Provide all registration numbers for any/all States where they are held.
15)May I have a planholders list for the above referenced project, if available? A planholders list is not available for this solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State, Security Integrity Division (IRM/OPS/ITI/SI) held the Demonstration Day for the Biometric Readers on July 1, 2009.

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed record of the live demonstration performed at the PKI lab in an effort to evaluate the capabilities of various biometrics and smart card Readers, and how they support the departments current needs.

Currently, the Biometric Logical Access Development & Execution (BLADE) program with in the PKI Program office is in the process of evaluating a number of biometric and smart card readers to determine which reader will best fit the departments needs in supporting the legacy biometric enabled PKI implementation, as well as the Departments HSPD-12. The selected reader will be backwards compatible and support all current PKI programs/projects.  IRMs Systems Integrity (SI) office performed these tests in the PKI lab.

The results of the Biometric Reader Live Test Demonstration is attached for your review.  The report provides the information on the testing, the equipment used and the results.

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to provide a continuum of planning, organizational, logistical, and facilitation services for the Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor &amp; Human Trafficking (OCFT)-sponsored grantee meetings and other occasional meetings, conferences, and symposia; and Record proceedings of the aforementioned OCFT-sponsored events and prepare related reports as requested. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond. Background The Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (OCFT) is an office within the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), an agency of the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL). OCFT activities include research on international child labor; supporting U.S. government policy on international child labor; administering and overseeing cooperative agreements with organizations working to eliminate child labor around the world; and raising awareness about child labor issues. Since 1995, the U.S. Congress has appropriated over $720 million to USDOL for efforts to combat exploitive child labor internationally. This funding has been used to support technical cooperation projects to combat exploitive child labor in more than 80 countries around the world. Technical cooperation projects funded by USDOL range from targeted action programs in specific sectors of work to more comprehensive programs that support national efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor as defined by ILO Convention 182. USDOL-funded child labor elimination projects generally seek to achieve five major goals: 1. Withdrawing or preventing children from involvement in exploitive child labor through the provision of direct educational services; 2. Strengthening policies on child labor and education, the capacity of national institutions to combat child labor, and formal and transitional education systems that encourage children engaged in or at risk of engaging in exploitive labor to attend school; 3. Raising awareness of the importance of education for all children and mobilizing a wide array of actors to improve and expand education infrastructures; 4. Supporting research and the collection of reliable data on child labor; and 5. Ensuring the long-term sustainability of these efforts. The approach of USDOL child labor elimination projects &ndash; decreasing the prevalence of exploitive child labor through increased access to education &ndash; is intended to nurture the development, health, safety, and enhanced future employability of children engaged in or at-risk of entering exploitive labor. Purpose and Objectives The goal of the proposed contract is to provide a continuum of planning, organizational, logistical, and facilitation services for the Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor &amp; Human Trafficking (OCFT)-sponsored grantee meetings and other occasional meetings, conferences, and symposia; and to record proceedings of the aforementioned OCFT-sponsored events and prepare related reports as requested.

<DESC><p>Synopsis The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain the services of highly-skilled researchers to conduct various research related tasks to assess child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond. Background The Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (OCFT) is part of the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB). The office was created in 1993 in response to a request from Congress to investigate and report on child labor around the world. As domestic and international concern about child labor grew, OCFT&rsquo;s activities significantly expanded. Today, these activities include research on international child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking; funding and overseeing cooperative agreements and contracts to organizations engaged in efforts to eliminate exploitive child labor around the world; and assisting in the development and implementation of U.S. government policy on international child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking issues. OCFT plays an active role in research and policy initiatives relating to international child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking. Pursuant to Congressional requests, OCFT has published annual international child labor reports since 1994. In 2000, Congress adopted the Trade and Development Act, which requires the Secretary of Labor to issue an annual report on the efforts of approximately 140 U.S. trade beneficiary countries and territories to meet their international commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. OCFT is also taking on a new research, monitoring, and reporting role as directed by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005. On January 10, 2006, the President signed into law the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 (TVPRA), H.R. 972. The TVPRA, in addition to reauthorizing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, includes provisions aimed at preventing trafficking in persons in conjunction with post-conflict and humanitarian emergency assistance. The TVPRA also includes additional activities specifically intended for the Department of Labor (DOL) to monitor and combat forced labor and child labor. Section 105(b)(2) listed these activities as: (A) Monitor the use of forced labor and child labor in violation of international standards; (B) Provide information regarding trafficking in persons for the purpose of forced labor to the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking of the Department of State for inclusion in [the] trafficking in persons report required by Section 110(b) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7107(b)); (C) Develop and make available to the public a list of goods from countries that the Bureau of International Labor Affairs has reason to believe are produced by forced labor or child labor in violation of international standards; (D) Work with persons who are involved in the production of goods on the list described in subparagraph (C) to create a standard set of practices that will reduce the likelihood that such persons will produce goods using the labor described in such subparagraph; and (E) Consult with other departments and agencies of the United States Government to reduce forced and child labor internationally and ensure that products made by forced labor and child labor in violation of international standards are not imported into the United States. Through these research activities as well as technical cooperation programming, ILAB-OCFT promotes international labor standards and aims to comply with the U.S. Government commitments under International Labor Organization Convention No. 182 to work with other countries to assist in efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor. Purpose and Objectives The purpose of this contract is to secure the services of highly-skilled researchers to conduct various research related tasks to assess child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking.

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a package of related services including research, analysis of business practices, a publication, and meetings/trainings. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond. Background The Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (OCFT) of the Department of Labor&rsquo;s Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) is interested in awarding a contract for a package of related services including developing a framework/set of criteria; conducting background research and producing a bibliography; producing a compendium; carrying out stakeholder consultations/meetings; and providnig training to USDOL staff.

Pursuant to Congressional requests, OCFT has published annual international child labor reports since 1994. In 2000, Congress adopted the Trade and Development Act, which requires the Secretary of Labor to issue an annual report on the efforts of approximately 140 U.S. trade beneficiary countries and territories to meet their international commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Through these research activities as well as technical cooperation programming, ILAB OCFT promotes international labor standards and aims to comply with the U.S. Government commitments under International Labor Organization Convention No. 182 to work with other countries to assist in efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor. Purpose and Objectives The goal of the proposed program is to reduce the likelihood that producers of goods worldwide will use forced labor and child labor in their production. The TVPRA proposed to achieve this goal by working with persons involved in production to explore good practices in this area. To accomplish this goal, USDOL has established several key objectives, including the development of a framework/set of criteria to evaluate good practice; wide dissemination of examples of good practices for replication; stakeholder engagement through meetings and consultations; and increased capacity of USDOL staff to provide technical assistance to companies on these and related issues. Project Requirements Task 1: Framework/Set of Criteria. Develop a framework/set of criteria for analyzing and identifying &ldquo;good practices&rdquo; that can be used by private sector entities to reduce the likelihood that goods are produced using child labor and forced labor. Development of this framework/set of criteria should include not only the framework itself, but guidelines for its application. These guidelines should clearly describe how the framework is to be used, by whom, for what purpose(s), etc. Task 2: Background Research/Bibliography. Conduct comprehensive background research and produce a bibliography of current practices in use (such as tools, toolkits, systems, activities, programs, relationships, collaborative arrangements, etc.) to reduce child labor and forced labor in the production of goods. Research should include such methods as desk review, attending meetings of knowledgeable groups, interviews with companies, and other methods. Task 3: Compendium. Using the framework/set of criteria developed under Task 1 and the practices collected under Task 2, identify a selection of the best practices currently in use and compile them into a Compendium targeting a business audience. The Compendium should include examples of practices in a wide variety of categories, and could be written as case studies or in other formats. It must be a complete, print-ready publication, in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, including all relevant content: all text, sidebars/highlight boxes, suggested graphics/photos, etc. The publication will be posted on USDOL&rsquo;s Web site and must be Section 508 compliant. Task 4: Meetings/Consultations. At least two stakeholder meetings/consultations with businesses, employers&rsquo; organizations, NGOs, and trade unions, at a minimum. At least one consultation should occur within the United States. Each meeting/consultation should be followed by a summary of meeting proceedings that can be published and disseminated to keep all stakeholders informed. Task 5: Training for USDOL Staff. A training or series of trainings to build the capacity of USDOL/OCFT staff. Staff should be trained in the content of research conducted, in the analysis of good business practices, and in skills to provide technical assistance to businesses seeking guidance from USDOL in the area of forced labor and child labor eradication. Capability Statement OCFT is interested in soliciting capability statements from all qualified Offerors demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort. At a minimum prospective Offerors must document capabilities in the following areas. &bull; Familiarity with current business practices in the area of child and forced labor in global supply chains, in a variety of industries. Familiarity may be demonstrated through a discussion of how the organization used it in prior work, or through convincing discussion of the work of others. &bull; Capacity to innovate systematic analytical tools (i.e., Task 1, the framework/set of criteria). &bull; Capacity to research and analyze &ldquo;good practices&rdquo; for businesses/private sector in combating forced labor and child labor in a comprehensive manner. &bull; Familiarity with other current efforts to formulate, compile, analyze, and disseminate guidance and good practice in this area (in order to avoid duplication). &bull; Experience producing publication-quality written materials. &bull; Track record of working with business/private sector entities to formulate policies and guide implementation of practices in this area. &bull; Track record of successful multi-stakeholder engagement on related topics. &bull; Capacity and skills to guide high-profile meetings and consultations with various stakeholders, including business. &bull; Capacity and skills to conduct training. &bull; Personnel possess knowledge of current business practices in the area of child and forced labor in global supply chains, in a variety of industries. &bull; Personnel possess experience in creating analytical tools. &bull; Personnel possess experience working on publications in related fields. &bull; Personnel possess experience working with a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the field of corporate social responsibility. &bull; Personnel possess experience in guiding high-profile meetings and consultations with various stakeholders, including business.

<DESC><p>Synopsis The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement for Attestation Engagement Services. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to conduct attestation engagements in accordance with the U.S. Government Accountability Office&rsquo;s (GAO) Government Auditing Standards and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Audit and Attest Standards. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond. Background The Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (OCFT) is an office within the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), an agency of the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL). OCFT activities include research on international child labor; supporting U.S. government policy on international child labor; administering and overseeing cooperative agreements with organizations working to eliminate child labor around the world; and raising awareness about child labor issues. Since 1995, the U.S. Congress has appropriated over $720 million to USDOL for efforts to combat exploitive child labor internationally. This funding has been used to support technical cooperation projects to combat exploitive child labor in more than 80 countries around the world. Technical cooperation projects funded by USDOL range from targeted action programs in specific sectors of work to more comprehensive programs that support national efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor as defined by ILO Convention 182. USDOL-funded child labor elimination projects generally seek to achieve five major goals: 1. Withdrawing or preventing children from involvement in exploitive child labor through the provision of direct educational services; 2. Strengthening policies on child labor and education, the capacity of national institutions to combat child labor, and formal and transitional education systems that encourage children engaged in or at risk of engaging in exploitive labor to attend school; 3. Raising awareness of the importance of education for all children and mobilizing a wide array of actors to improve and expand education infrastructures; 4. Supporting research and the collection of reliable data on child labor; and 5. Ensuring the long-term sustainability of these efforts. The approach of USDOL child labor elimination projects &ndash; decreasing the prevalence of exploitive child labor through increased access to education &ndash; is intended to nurture the development, health, safety, and enhanced future employability of children engaged in or at-risk of entering exploitive labor. USDOL reports annually to Congress on a number of indicators. As these programs have developed, an increasing emphasis has been placed on ensuring that the data collected by grantees is accurate and reported according to USDOL definitions. Since 2001, the US Congress has provided over $230 million to USDOL to support the Child Labor Education Initiative (EI), which focuses on the elimination of the worst forms of child labor through the provision of education opportunities. These projects are being implemented by a wide range of international and non-governmental organizations as well as for-profit firms. USDOL typically awards EI cooperative agreements through a competitive bid process. These cooperative agreements may be awarded to a single grantee, or to a lead grantee with associate grantees. EI projects are designed to ensure that children in areas with a high incidence of child labor are withdrawn and integrated into educational settings, and that they persist in their education once enrolled. In parallel, the program seeks to avert at-risk children from leaving school and entering child labor. The EI is based on the notion that the elimination of exploitative child labor depends, to a large extent, on improving access to, quality of, and relevance of education. Without improving educational quality and relevance, children withdrawn/prevented from child labor may not have viable alternatives and could resort to other forms of hazardous work. EI projects may focus on providing educational services to children removed from specific sectors of work and/or a specific region(s) or support a national Timebound Program that aims to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in multiple sectors of work specific to a given country. The Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking of the Department of Labor&rsquo;s Bureau of International Labor Affairs is interested in awarding a contract for the conduct of project-specific attestation engagements of USDOL-funded Education Initiative technical assistance projects implemented internationally through the award of cooperative agreements. These attestation engagements must be in accordance with the most recent U.S. Government Auditing Standards and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Audit and Attest Standards. The objectives of each attestation engagement are to: determine whether grantees are in compliance with the terms of their respective USDOL-funded cooperative agreements and applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars; assess whether financial reporting is accurate and complete; and assess the accuracy and reliability of the grantee&rsquo;s performance data as stated in semi-annual progress reporting to USDOL. Purpose and Objectives The goal of the proposed program is to determine whether grantees are complying with the terms of their OCFT cooperative agreements and with the Department of Labor&rsquo;s regulations for grants as promulgated under 29 CFR, part 95 (June 2007 or subsequently updated versions) as well as applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars; ensure that financial reports are accurate and complete; and assess the accuracy and reliability of the grantees&rsquo; performance data from their progress reports in support of the OCFT performance goals and measures as stated in the USDOL&rsquo;s performance budget and Annual Report on Performance and Accountability. Project Requirements 1. General Planning a. Update the most recent version of OCFT&rsquo;s Examination Guide for conducting the attestation engagements required under the award. 2. Planning for Attestation Engagements a. Obtain and review relevant single audits and internal/external evaluation and monitoring reports of organizations implementing OCFT projects to understand potential project issues and avoid duplication of oversight coverage. The attestation engagements shall build upon these and identify previous findings that have not been corrected. 3. Conducting and Reporting on Attestation Engagements a. Build upon and expand on the compliance testing conducted by the single audits or other relevant audits, as applicable, focusing on the activities of each Grantee specific to the USDOL-funded project. These compliance requirements include, but are not limited to: activities allowed or unallowed; allowable costs/cost principles; cost determination/indirect costs; cash management; eligibility; equipment and inventory management; matching costs; procurement; program income; construction; compensation and fringe benefits; financial and performance reporting; sub-contractor selection and monitoring; OCFT policy requirements; and special tests and provisions. b. Assess the financial management of the project, including the effectiveness of financial procedures, the accounting system, budget management, and internal financial controls, and the accuracy and reliability of the project&rsquo;s financial reports. c. Identify questioned costs resulting from non-compliance with USDOL regulations or cooperative agreement provisions. d. Assess the project&rsquo;s effectiveness in reporting accurately the performance data required by OCFT to measure its Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 goals related to withdrawing and preventing children from exploitative child labor through provision of education services. e. Rely extensively on alternative procedures, including site visits to a sample of schools and other project locations, interviews with children, parents, teachers and other project stakeholders as necessary and appropriate, in order to: (1) validate reported performance data; (2) verify compliance with regulations and the provisions of the cooperative agreement; and, (3) confirm project expenditures, particularly in situations where documentation is inadequate. f. Based on physical observations, report information on whether or not schools and their related facilities (including restroom facilities and drinking water) that serve project beneficiaries are safe and free from obvious threats to the physical well-being of beneficiaries. g. Develop findings in the examination report which include a condition, criteria, cause, effect, and recommendations for each problem noted during the engagement. h. Provide an examination report including an opinion on the financial reports, compliance, and performance data with findings. 4. Analyze and Disseminate Findings a. Prepare a report that analyzes and describes trends across all attestation engagements b. Present findings to ILAB staff as requested Capability Statement OCFT is interested in soliciting capability statements from all qualified Offerors demonstrating their ability to perform attestation engagements. At a minimum prospective Offerors must document capabilities in the following areas. &bull; Capacity to perform the attestation engagements as described above, including any affiliation with an international audit firm and a list of clients &bull; Internal quality control system &bull; External quality control review &bull; Ability to provide auditors or translators fluent in the local language of the countries visited (may include Arabic, French, Portuguese, Spanish among others) &bull; Explanation of internal management and quality control systems to be used to identify, contract, and assist in the planning and deployment of qualified individuals to assist in the tasks required by this contract, including Continuing Professional Education program (CPE) &bull; Experience with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 and the U.S. Government&rsquo;s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars &bull; Experience in applying American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Standards and the July 2007 Revision of the Government Auditing Standards published by the Comptroller General of the United States in conducting examination level attestation engagements in international settings/ implementing environments &bull; Experience of personnel in designing and implementing international project/program attestation engagements RESPONSES: All interested parties who believe they meet the above mentioned criteria are invited to respond to this RFI, with an indication if their ability to fulfill the above requirements.

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought

Requirement 

The United States Government currently occupies office space and related space in a building under lease in Brownsville, TX.   The Government is seeking to lease two buildings that are in very close proximity to each other.  The first building should be approximately 13,600 rentable square feet of office space.  The second building should be 2,130 rentable square feet of office related space. The rentable spaces must yield a minimum of 12,719 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet (OASF) and 2,006 contiguous ANSI/BOMA OASF, respectively.

The lease term requirement is for 10 years, 5 years firm. The space must be available for occupancy by April 16, 2010. The delineated area is the city of Brownsville, TX. Only existing buildings will be considered.

Other applicable requirements include:

	A minimum ceiling height of 8 ft 6 Inches is required for the larger block of space, and a minimum of 13 ft 0 inches is required for the smaller block 
	The smaller block of space must be provided in a stand-alone, single tenant building
	52 Secured Parking Spaces (Fencing accepted on a case-by-case basis)

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as replication of tenant improvements, security and telecommunication infrastructure.

Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing no later than 4:00 pm Central, July 16, 2009, and should include the following information:

<CONTACT>Erica A Blake, Contracting Officer, Phone 6182292481, Email erica.blake@ustranscom.mil - Charles M Burton, Contracting Officer, Phone 618-229-2468, Email charles.burton@ustranscom.mil
<DESC><p>DELIVERY OF BREAK-BULK AND ROLLING STOCK CARGO TO/FROM  WORLD-WIDE LOCATIONS (PRIMARILY CONUS) TO/FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ USING A COMBINATION OF SURFACE (PRIMARILY OCEAN) AND AIR TRANSPORTATION
The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is conducting a market survey on industry capabilities and potential sources for intra-theater surface (primarily ocean) and air (multimodal) transportation of military break-bulk cargo to/from various destinations in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The Government is looking for commercial solutions to maximize the cost savings associated with surface (primarily ocean) transportation for the longest and safest portions of these movements, while capitalizing on the speed and safety of airlift to move designated break-bulk cargo to the final destinations in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Maps with detailed routing, stops, and mode changes should be included for every option presented, to include information on any proposed or considered teaming arrangements.  The Cargo Preference Act, Fly America Act, DoD airlift and DoD sealift policies shall apply to any requirement for ocean and air transportation of military cargo.  There is no solicitation package at this time.
 
This market research is designed to solicit ideas and opinions from experts in the ocean and air transportation industries to determine the level of interested sources and industry capabilities.  The Government is also interested in rough order of magnitude (ROM) pricing for a theoretical unit move.  The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and shall not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation expenses or make an award on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information synopsis.  Copies of information submitted by interested parties shall be reproduced and submitted to a USTRANSCOM team for review and shall be used to evaluate industry capabilities. If determined feasible after review and evaluation of the responses, the Government may develop a requirement in the future.  
USTRANSCOM is seeking information on industry capabilities and potential sources who can provide reliable and secure Time Definite Delivery, in-transit visibility (ITV) and end to end management of break-bulk military cargo from/to world-wide locations (primarily CONUS), to/from various locations in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The majority of cargo deliveries in Afghanistan will be to Bagram (OAIX) and Kandahar (OAKN) airfields with additional service to airfields in Iraq.  The military cargo may consist of a 1.1 to 1.4 hazardous classification.  Shipments from/to the origin to/from the various destinations in the region could eventually amount to approximately 10,000 tons, 304,000 square feet of break-bulk cargo and rolling stock.
USTRANSCOM encourages all interested companies to submit detailed responses that specifically outline your company&rsquo;s ability to meet the following requirements:
1.  Accept cargo (on behalf of the Government) at the origin and to ensure delivery at the final destination.  The Government requires transit times between 15 to 20 days from origin acceptance (CONUS) to various locations within Afghanistan and Iraq.
2.  Provide real-time in-transit visibility compatible with command and control applications on cargo location and provide full access to the shipper and other Government employees designated by the Contracting Officer.
3.  Ensure cargo security during transport and at transloading points.
4.  Ensure cargo delivery for 95 percent of shipments by the required delivery date (RDD).
5.  If required, provide direct delivery to Forward Operating Bases.
6.  Initiate process improvements and other value added services.
7.  Provide end to end management with customized information management reports related to delivery time, delivery reliability, shipment volume and other criteria that characterize and to provide performance based views.
8.  Handle substantial increases in shipments (surge requirements) as needed for wartime and other contingencies.
9.  Provide security for cargo from origin to destination not including the air portion of travel.
Market Survey:
USTRANSCOM is asking for industry input and comment for this requirement, to include commercial best practices and logistics/transportation management capabilities.  All interested parties (including potential prime contractors, subcontractors, and/or teams) are strongly encouraged to submit a response to this RFI.  Responses should be concise and include the following responses:
1.  What type of comprehensive innovative alternatives does your company have?  
2.  What capability does your company have to perform the described services?
3.  If interested, would your company be interested in submitting a proposal for the described services?  If not, why?  If so, briefly describe your capabilities.
4.  What are the recommended commercial practices for these types of services? 
5.  What are the recommended methods used to secure cargo at transloading points?
6.  What are the methods/metrics the commercial industry uses for monitoring this type of performance?
7.  In a Performance Work Statement, what flexibility must the respondent have in order to propose the most effective and economical transportation operation?
8.  What data from the U.S. Government would be required to develop a proposal to manage and operate inbound and outbound transportation requirements?
9.  Describe the risks associated with this effort and how, if any, can they be mitigated?
10.  Provide a description of your company&rsquo;s teaming and relationship management practices with sub-contractors along with your company&rsquo;s understanding of the challenges and risks of operating successfully in the region.
11.  Are there any specific limits to your company&rsquo;s capabilities?
12.  Does your company have experience in providing the described services with an operation similar in size and scope?

<DESC><p>This contract action was 95.19 percent time and material (T&amp;M)&nbsp;and 4.81 percent firm fixed price. A T&amp;M type pricing arrangment was used because each repair cannot be estimated with any reasonable degree of confience.</p>
<p>The award was sole source because Lockheed Martin, Cage 98897 is the only known source that can provide the&nbsp; required unique contractor owned special support equipment, specialized test sets, skilled personnel, data&nbsp;and facilities to fully enclose up to four&nbsp;C-5 aircraft at a time. In addition,&nbsp;Lockheed is the only source for major repairs to primary structural damage identified on the C-5 aircraft that requires the use of Lockkheed Martin Proprietary Stress Memo Manual, Durability and Damage Tolerance Analysis (DADTA), and related engineering design and test data system which Lockheed Martin has proprietary rights to&nbsp;its engineering design and test data systems.&nbsp;</p>
