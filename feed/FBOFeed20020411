<DESC>The FHWA Office of Pavement Technology has a requirement to research and study the relationship between long-term performance and concrete pavement curl and wrap. The contractor will use high-speed inertial profiling technology to collect and analyze pavement profile and performance data on in-service pavements to 1) determine if the magnitude of joined plain concrete pavement (JPCP) slab curvature can be related to pavement performance 2) determine the extent of JPCP slab curvature allowable under specific environmental and support conditions to provide long-term performance 3) identify construction methods or design characteristics to achieve the above. Background: Recent advances in inertial profiling technology and advances in computer technology make it possible to measure reliably the shape of very large numbers of PCC pavement slabs over a short period of time and perform analysis of this data. These measurements can be repeated to develop a time-history of pavement slab shape. This technology was recently demonstrated by a high-speed inertial profiler that performed a detailed profile survey of four lanes of a 24 km Interstate pavement four times within a 24-hour period (Sixbey, et al. 2001). Sixbey found that the magnitude of curvature of the slabs surveyed varied from positive 15mm to negative 15mm using best-fit curve and simulated straightedge. The daily change in slab curvature was frequently measured at 5-7mm over a 22C pavement temperature range.  It is hypothesized that slab shape changes in response construction conditions and diurnal temperature gradients may have a significant role in pavement performance. The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the Electronic Posting System (EPS) at http://www.eps.gov. NO WRITTEN, TELEPHONIC, FACSIMILE OR EMAIL REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE HONORED. Interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements by email. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to MONITOR the EPS website for any solicitation amendments. This requirement is 100% SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. It is currently estimated that the RFP will be posted on the EPS on or about April 22, 2002. NAICS Code: 54171. See Note 1.

Mirror unit: Type-parabolic; coating-tungsten/silicon; divergence of beam is 0.04 degrees (horizontally). 3.	Four bounce monochromator unit: A high precision four bounce monochromator Germanium (220/440) unit including rotation and translation stages, and cross slits designed and fabricated such that it works equally well for both Copper K (alpha 1) and molybdenum K (alpha 1) in a reliable and convenient manner. The monochromators can be introduced and removed from the incident beam, e.g., by motorized translations. Gemanium (220/440). Bragg-angle range: 5 to 60 degrees. Rotation resolution: 0.001 degree or better. Translation resolution: 2 Microns. Translation repeatability: 1 Micron. Divergence of beam: 10 to 12 arc seconds for four-bounce Germanium (220), Copper K (alpha 1). Divergence of beam: five arc seconds for four bounce Germanium (440), Copper K (alpha 1). A double-bounce mode can be conveniently realized by moving one one-channel-cut crystal out of the beam. 4.	Four-circle Goniometer, sample stage: A large full-circle Eulerian cradle, either Huber 512.1 or its equivalent (form, fit and function) is required. The diffractometer provides four circle motions, e.g., Phi, Chi, Omega, and 2 Theta, and can afford a sample or a growth cell weight up to 8 kgs. Both manual and motor controlled motion modes are required for Chi and Phi. Sample adjustment stages shall include: a Goniometer head (Huber 1003) together with a pin and spacers; a Z-translation stage and an XY-translation unit enabling protein and semiconductor single crystals to be aligned in a practical and convenient manner as well as measured in-situ and statically.

Washington, DC 20002.
 Purpose:
Substance use leading to serious behavioral and/or health problems continues to be commonplace in all communities, and the prevalence of illicit drug use today is higher in the United States than in any other industrialized society.  Data from the 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse indicate that 14.8 million Americans use illicit drugs. A study conducted titled "The Economic Costs of Drug Abuse in the United  States, 1992?1998, released by  National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) on January 23, 2002,  showed that  illegal drug use strains the nation's health care resources and drives up health care costs for all Americans. The goals of this project will sustain the strong network of congregations operating drug and treatment programs and further strengthen their  treatment skill competencies, Diabetes, grant writing and program evaluation skills.  Participants will again engage in workshops and skill building activities
during the Technical Assistance event.

<DESC>The objectives of this study are to determine the characteristics of motorcycle operators in the general rider population, and to the extent possible, the characteristics, behaviors, and experiences associated with motorcyclists who are crash involved, especially those who are 40 years of age and older.  Data to be collected include biographic and demographic characteristics, riding habits, rider training, and licensing status.   Although riders of all ages will be surveyed, the study shall focus on riders over the age of 40. Ultimately, the collection and analysis of these data, when combined with other information, will enable NHTSA to improve the types of countermeasures developed for reducing the occurrence of injury producing crashes.

The contractor shall prepare and implement a data collection and analysis plan for obtaining survey data from up to 2,000 motorcyclists in the general rider population. Unless a suitable alternative approach can be developed for collecting the data, Office of Management and Budget approval shall be sought and obtained prior to initiating the survey.  At a minimum, data will be collected at events and locations where motorcyclists congregate and can be observed riding.  A technical report suitable for publication shall be prepared that provides insight into the characteristics, behaviors, and experiences of riders who are, and are not, crash involved.  The report shall focus on motorcyclists age 40 years and older and comparisons will be made for those over and under 40 years of age.  A major challenge is to collect clusters of related data that may be useful for countermeasures development.  

The contractor will be required to demonstrate substantial knowledge of motorcycling and motorcycle-safety issues as well as successful field data-collection expertise specifically related to motorcyclist behaviors.  Additionally, the contractor will need to demonstrate expertise in field data analysis.  Those contractors not meeting these requirements will not be considered.

A cost reimbursable type contract is anticipated with a period of performance of 18 months.  Electronic copies of this solicitation will be available on the GSA's Electronic Posting Systems (EPS), located on the Internet at http://www.esp.gov  or www.fedbisopps.gov . It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet sites for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading and printing their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies will not be accepted.  The anticipated issuance date is May 31, 2002.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The US Army Communications Electronics Command Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate Humanitarian Demining Team proposes a non-competitive acquisition with Applied Research Associates, Inc. (ARA), Albuquerque, NM, for development of a Propellant Torch System (PTS) for Hardened Mine Neutralization to neutralize all surface buried landmines by burning in demining operations. The proposed mine neutralization technology is based on ARA's proven, proprietary pyrotechnics mixtures.  The contractor shall  perform the proposed work in six tasks.  The proposed tasks are directed to meet the primary requirement to penetrate all soft and hard case materials quickly and effectively, with a PTS device that is simple, reliable, safe, non-toxic and cheap. The cont ractor shall conduct a parametric type evaluation using PTS composition particle sizes.  The contractor shall conduct tests with various particle sizes of aluminum (Al), potassium perchlorate (KP) and Tetra Fluoro Carbon (TFC). The contractor shall conduct  analytical computations to assess the influence of variance in stiochiometry of the PTS composition with and without zinc (Zn).  The contractor shall conduct tests  with variations of stoichiometry systematically the amount of Al, KP, Zn, TFC and/or binde r.  The contractor shall conduct tests to assess the influence of Zn on chemical initiation aspects of TNT.  The contractor shall develop and evaluate energetic and fuel-type binders for the PTS composition. The contractor shall select a suitable binder th at will provide a safe, reliable, effective extrudable grain for use in the PTS. The contractor shall conduct tests on PTS for Department of Transportation  hazards classification.  The contractor shall further evaluate and improve the design, including in vestigation of a non-ferrous housing.  The contractor shall quantify the performance of the PTS composition as a function of device design ,e.g. diameter, length, nozzle size, and related linear and mass burn rate. The contractor shall develop and demonstr ate a universal PTS device design that will quickly and effectively penetrate the most difficult land mine casings including cast iron and cement. The contractor shall deliver 90 field-ready PTS devices to the Government for evaluation.  The performance of  the all tasks will be completed within 12 months after acceptance of this contract. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1).  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the above Propellant Torch Systems for hardened land mine neutralization may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency. Offerors must possess technical expertise and/or experience building propellant torch systems.   Responses should be no longer than five (5) pages and must be received via email within 45 calendar days of the date of this notice.

<DESC>The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) recently moved into a brand-new 11-story office building in Washington, DC. As part of the interior design for the new building, we are interested in displaying photographs on each of the floors. The photographs will be of images that remind our employees of education--college campuses, students on campus, college graduations, etc.--and collectively communicate FSA's mission of "Putting America through School."  The purpose of this procurement is to purchase 60 high-quality photographic images that FSA will have printed, mounted, and displayed in our new building.  Once FSA has selected the 60 photographic images they wish to have printed from the selection the contractor has provided, it is anticipated that the printed and mounted documents will vary in size, with the average size being 26 x 38 inches.  The photographs will be printed as mainly chromogenic [color] prints and mounted so they can be displayed for years.  The contractor for this project is responsible for producing the images, not for the printing and mounting of the documents for display.  The contractor for this project shall:  1)  Provide FSA with a selection of photos sufficient to choose 60 high-quality photographs.  The photographer shall include a wide variety of pictures that incorporate images of college campuses, students, and graduation ceremonies which reflects FSA's mission; 2)  Assist FSA in selecting the 60 images to be used; and 3)  Provide FSA with negatives and proof sheets for the 60 selected images no later than June 1, 2002.  FSA will return the negatives back to the contractor once they have had the photos printed in hanging quality form for display.  The photographer will retain rights to the negatives.  FSA will have first time and residual rights to use the images for the web and other media.  If the contractor so chooses, FSA staff can assist the photographer on the project in helping them gain access to school sites in the Washington, DC and New York areas.   Options:  The Government shall have the right to order up to 2 additional lots of 60 images each between June 1, 2002 and May 31, 2003 at the option prices stated in the order.  Exercise of an option is at the sole discretion of the Government and may only be exercised by the Contracting Officer.  If the Government exercises its option, the Contracting Officer shall give the Contractor written notice of the option that establishes a completion date for the option that is at least 60 days from the date the Contracting Officer exercises the option.  Perspective offerers must submit the following material to FSA:  1) the names, addresses, and phone numbers of two professional references;  2) a CD-Rom portfolio of past work;  3) a brief bio; and 4) A pricing proposal that includes:  a)  A firm-fixed price for the initial 60 images; b)  A firm-fixed price for each of the optional lots of 60 images.  (The Government is seeking a firm-fixed price for this project, i.e., a single bottom-line price rather than a variable pricing arrangement such as an hourly rate or expenses.  The Government will only pay the firm-fixed price and will not reimburse the contractor for any costs incurred.)  Proposals must be received by the following person no later than 4:00 pm on April 25, 2002:  Deb Wrabley, Contracting Officer, ED/FSA/FSA Administration, Rm. 54D2, Union Center Plaza 3, 830 First Street, NE, Washington, DC  (zip code for onsite delivery is 20002; regular mail, 20202).   Proposals will be evaluated on the following measures:  1)  demonstrated ability to communicate a message through photography; 2) demonstrated ability to shoot high-quality negatives that can be blown up into larger prints; 3) ability to plan a large project and complete it in a timely manner; and 4) Price, including any option prices.

The handcuff performance shall not degrade when stored and operated in climatic design types of hot, cold and basic, in accordance with Army Regulation (AR) 70-38, http://www.usapa.army.mil/gils/epubs3.html.  Materials used shall no t create any hazards that might negatively impact the health, safety and performance of the user.  The handcuff will require a case and have the ability to attach to standard law enforcement equipment belt or fit into the existing standard police handcuff case.  An instruction sheet on the use and care of the handcuff shall also be included.  The Government requires a two-year warranty for the handcuffs (fifteen-year warranty is desired).  The U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting D ivision, located at the U. S. Army Soldier & Biological Chemical Command, Natick, MA will award up to three (3) purchase orders (within funding constraints) for up to a maximum quantity of 60 each handcuffs (60 each if handcuffs fit into existing standard police handcuff case or 30 each without case and 30 each with case if handcuffs do not fit into existing standard police handcuff case) for user evaluation/acceptance.  Items will be technically evaluated and field-tested for the following criteria: perfor mance/durability (to include NIJ Standard requirements indicated above); human factors (to include user acceptance/preference); and compatibility with standard law enforcement equipment belt/standard police handcuff case.  Performance and Human Factors are  of equal importance to each other, both being more important than compatibility.  It will take approximately three (3) months from the time of award of a purchase order until the completion of the government user evaluation and down-selection. If items ar e evaluated acceptable in the criteria defined above, the Government may exercise an option to procure up to a maximum quantity of 15,000 each handcuffs from one company based on feedback from user evaluation (down-selection to one contractor will be based  on criteria delineated above) and the item offering the best value to the Government.

The Government desires delivery of the optional quantitie s (CLIN 0002) within 60 calendar days for quantities of 0001 to 5000, within 90 calendar days for quantities of 5001 to 10000, and within 120 calendar days for quantities of 10001 to 15000 following exercise of option. The Government reserves the right to exercise the option as many times as necessary until the maximum quantity is ordered.  Offerors may propose a different delivery schedule in their proposals that may provide earlier delivery, but may not propose a delivery date later than the Government's required delivery time. The ship-to addresses for the 60 each handcuffs (30 each handcuffs to each address) for test and evaluation (CLIN 0001 – F.O.B. Destination) are U.S. Army Soldier Biological & Chemical Command, Natick, MA 01760 and U.S. Army Aberdee n Test Center, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD  21005.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), is seeking comments from industry, the public and other stakeholders on Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) No. DE-RP96-02PO92207 for the Management and Operation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve sites located in the Gulf Coast region of Louisiana and Texas.  The Draft RFP and cover letter will be available in the DOE Interactive Industry Procurement System (IIPS) on or about April 15, 2002.  We would appreciate your comments on all aspects of the RFP with particular attention to the terms and conditions of the contract, the evaluation criteria in Section M, and the proposal preparation instructions in Section L.  In addition, your comments on the general clarity and consistency of the RFP, as well as the appropriateness of the solicitation open period, are solicited. Please note that, as stated in Section M of the solicitation, proposing any exceptions or deviations to the terms and conditions of the resulting contract may make the offer unacceptable for award without discussions.  Therefore, if you have concerns over specific terms and conditions of the Draft RFP, this comment period is the proper time to raise them. In addition to the requirements contained in the draft solicitation, the Government is considering including an aggressive cost incentive fee provision (i.e., producing the same or greater value to the Government for significantly less cost) providing the contractor with the opportunity to earn significantly more fee (i.e., 150 to 200%) over the term of the contract.  We are specifically seeking industry perspective and comments on this concept. Your attention is called to the Cost Reduction Goals and the 2002 Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan currently posted in the M&O Contract Reading Room at http://www.spr.doe.gov.  These documents reflect the baseline performance plan for the current contract. While the Draft Solicitation includes the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation clause entitled CONDITIONAL PAYMENT OF FEE, PROFIT or INCENTIVES dated December 2000, the Department has published a proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on 2/1/01 revising this clause.  One of the primary objectives of this proposed rulemaking is to make fee reductions less subjective, including the consideration of mitigating circumstances.  Comments and recommendations on the proposed rulemaking clause, with particular attention to establishing objective mitigating factors, are encouraged.  As noted in Clause I.95, when the new clause comes into effect from this rulemaking, the contractor may elect to retain the current December 2000 clause or modify the contract to incorporate the new clause. A review of the Directives applicable to this solicitation is currently being conducted to determine which Directives can be replaced by commercial or other standards, where appropriate.  Comments with respect to the list of applicable directives located in the Solicitation at Section J, Appendix F, and the use of commercial or other standards are encouraged. The DOE contemplates award of a cost-plus-award-fee performance based management and operating contract as a result of this solicitation, which includes a cost-reimbursement (no fee) phase-in transition period (approximately 2 months).  The principle functions to be performed by the Contractor are: Operations and Maintenance of SPR oil storage facilities; Engineering; Construction Management; Integrated Management and Control; Acquisition and Materiel Management; Human Resources Management; Environmental, Safety and Health Programs; Quality Assurance; Security (including Guard Services); and Information System Services.  DynMcDermott Petroleum Operations Company currently operates the SPR sites.  The current contract with DynMcDermott expires on March 31, 2003.  The magnitude of the proposed contract is estimated at $100 to $120 million per annum.  The cost-plus-award-fee performance based contract will be for a period of 5-years (5) years and will include options for up to an additional 5 years.  The DOE anticipates issuing the RFP in May 2002, with offers due in July 2002.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genetic Branch, plans to procure a Chip Writer Colony Arraying System with Virtek Vision, 785 Bridge Street Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2V 2K1.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The NCI Genetic Branch research, focuses on defining the molecular determinants of mitosis and checkpoint responses in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae.  NCI wishes to expand and develop yeast/human cross species approaches to identify evolutionary conserved genes in these pathways.  The relevance of our studies is reinforced by the fact that, to date, about one-third of all human disease-associated genes have functional homologs in yeast including, mammalian homologs of yeast genes required for chromosome segregation and DNA damage response pathways.  These studies suggest that detailed analysis of chromosome segregation and checkpoint responses in budding yeast will help us understand how these processes operate (health) or fail to operate (disease) in humans.  The completion of the genome sequences of S. cerevisiae has resulted in a huge library of resources.  One of these is the availability of the entire set of isogenic deletion strains for both essential (heterozygous diploids) and non-essential (haploid) genes.  This resource has been widely used by yeast researchers for genetic, biochemical and cell biology approaches.  It has been designed by researchers from the University of Toronto, Canada.  This screen will allow NCI to perform genome wide screens that can be very tedious if done manually.  Genetic screens can take a year to several years if done manually.  A table top model of a robot that allows one to expeditiously perform these screens has been designed by Virtek.   NCI will be using the Virtek ChipWriter for several experiments to list a few: 1)  synthetic lethal screen with a deletion strain for hug1 strain,  2) synthetic dosage lethality with checkpoint and kinetochore components and, 3) generation of a chromosome missegregation mutant collection.  Minimum Requirements: 1) compact design with totally intuitive graphical user interface software to let users easily and efficiently perform arraying and replicating of colonies, 2) replicator heads with 96/384/768 pins available for colony arraying in sterile, dust-free environment with regulated humidity and positive pressure within the environmental chamber,  3) three wash stations, sonicator, and an air-dryer nit are available for easy cleaning of pins, 4) automatic lidding and delidding of microwell plates to prevent cross-contamination of samples and, 5) high precision XYZ robot with micron accuracy (+/- 3 microns repeatability, and up to 10 microns absolute accuracy).  This will allow creating colony arrays that can not be obtained by hand-held replicator.  Virtek Vision is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned instrument.  It is believed that Virtek Vision is the only company that has custom designed the instrument for research on budding yeast.  This instrument is unique with no comparable instruments on the market.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, (local Washington DC time) on April 26, 2002.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing to Malinda Holdcraft on electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax, 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Faxed capability statements will not be accepted.  If submitting capability statements, please provide one original and two copies to Malinda Holdcraft, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. 6th floor Suite 4, Rockville, Maryland 20852-7194.   ***Please note, if submitting questions by fax, that the NCI/RCB fax machine will be out of service April 18 through April 21, 2002.  It is highly recommended that any interested party submit questions via electronic mail, as stated above.

<DESC>The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), 4600 Sangamore Road, Bethesda, MD 20816, is soliciting proposals for the Novel Intelligence from Massive Data (NIMD) program via Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) NMA401-02-BAA-0004.  The BAA will be posted in its entirety on the following website:  www.nima.mil/poc/contracts/baa.html.  
      This BAA was originally released as a draft.  It has now been released in its final version.  Notification of any subsequent revisions will only be provided on the website listed above.  The information below has not changed from the first announcement.
       It is anticipated that multiple awards will be issued as a result of the BAA.  The program length is a minimum of 40 months and possesses a significant budget across the program's anticipated period of performance.  Questions can be directed via only e-mail to ACWEB1@nima.mil.  Questions should be submitted after review of the BAA and not from only reading this FEDBIZOPPS announcement.
	The initial proposal submittal date is 11 Jun 2002 and the BAA closing date is 3 October 2002.  Please see the BAA for the detailed and definitive information regarding proposal submission date requirements.
	The following is a brief description of the program.
	The Novel Intelligence from Massive Data (NIMD) program is aimed at focusing analytic attention on the most critical information found within massive data - information that indicates the potential for strategic surprise.  In this context, Novel Intelligence is defined as actionable information not previously known to the analyst or policy makers.  It gives the analyst new insight into a previously unappreciated or misunderstood threat.
	The BAA is interested in research in 5 areas: (1) Modeling analysts and analytic processes; (2) Recognizing, representing, and using prior and tacit knowledge; (3) Generating, representing and tracking multiple scenarios, hypotheses, and/or strategies; (4) Massive data structuring/organization, normalization, ingest, and analysis; and (5) Methods for human information interaction.  
	Novel intelligence is likely to result from recognizing the assumptions, biases, and hypotheses that drive an analysis and systematically helping analysts challenge or extend them. Ultimately, the most powerful analytic environment will be one in which information about analysts is not only induced from their activities, but in which they also have an active hand in explicitly constructing and manipulating representations or models of the analytic targets that contain and make explicit their knowledge, interests, hypotheses and biases, and other traits of their analytic state.  NIMD encourages research in two directions simultaneously: developing techniques and tools that assist analysts both in dealing with massive data and in interactively making explicit, modifying and updating their current analytic state, including their hypotheses, knowledge, interests, and biases; and developing techniques and tools that infer the state of analysts and the analytic process from analysts' activities as recorded through an instrumented environment.   
	Key abilities of NIMD-enabled systems are to identify structures within massive data, to generate novel and plausible explanations for those structures, and then to communicate these findings to analysts in ways that support further investigation.
	Having developed the structures and explanations, a NIMD-enabled system will help analysts evaluate them and track their plausibility as events unfold - gathering and tracking evidence related to multiple chains of reasoning, making it easy to recognize and simultaneously evaluate multiple alternatives objectively.  In particular, the system will alert analysts when a less-attended candidate becomes more deserving of attention.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to clarify the initial announcement dated March 28, 2002.  There is no RFP available for release. FSA is simply asking for interested parties to submit capability statements.  

The purpose of this effort is to disseminate and promote financial aid opportunities to low-income and minority students. FSA's objective is to hit a large targeted audience without a significant expenditure of resources. 

As stated in the previous announcement, FSA intends to enter into a sole source contract with ABC Radio Networks/The Tom Joyner Morning Show because of its national coverage/outreach and communication with the targeted audience. FSA is not looking for firms to develop a PR campaign. FSA will develop the creative for the PR campaign and provide it to ABC Radio Networks/The Tom Joyner Morning Show for promotion/dissemination.  Under the proposed contract, ABC Radio Networks/The Tom Joyner Morning Show will broadcast financial aid information on the Tom Joyner Morning Show web cast. Additionally, there will be a link from the Tom Joyner Morning Show website to the U.S. Department of Education website featuring financial aid information.  ABC Radio Networks/The Tom Joyner Morning Show will promote the web cast as a medium for obtaining financial aid information during the live broadcast of the Tom Joyner Morning Show for 26 weeks. There will be options in the contract for additional outreach/dissemination activities.  The goals of this promotional campaign are to: (1) raise awareness of the availability of federal student aid; (2) educate and engage parents in their child's high school career; (3) motivate students and parents to seek further information; and (4) encourage students and parents to visit the FSA website and ultimately complete the Federal Application for Student Aid (FAFSA).  FSA anticipates that the major tasks to be performed include the following: (1) a radio broadcast specifically reaching the target audience encouraging the target audience to visit the web cast for financial aid information; (2) hosting a website featuring information about federal student aid; and (3) tracking and reporting on the number of visitors to the website.

FSA is looking for qualified firms that can effectively reach a large segment of the targeted audience and accomplish the goals of FSA. FSA may consider other minority audience and media outlets other than radio broadcast and web hosting offered by interested firms. However, interested parties must show that they can reach a similarly large FSA targeted audience and accomplish the goals of FSA without expending large resources. 

The due date of 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on May 6, 2002 for capability statements remains the same.

Sources are sought to develop and integrate a millimeter wave RF (radio frequency) signal simulation capability into the Radio Frequency Generation and Injection (RFG&I) system developed by Amherst Systems, Raytheon, and Boeing. The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential offerors with the capability of performing the proposed effort. The current RFG&I system provides for the simulation of numerous radar and other RF signals in the 100 MHz to 18 GHz frequency range, with signal activity based on a computer simulation. Simulated signals are radiated into a free space environment using transmit amplifiers and elevated antennas.  The current simulator models threat platform motion, threat emitter mode changes, signal pulse characteristics, and transmit antenna scan modulations. A variety of signal modulation types are possible (e.g., amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, phase modulation).  The RFG&I system is used in conjunction with an RF monitoring system that allows characterization and identification of radiated signals. The scope of this activity is to extend the frequency range of the simulator to include the 30 to 40 GHz and 90 to 100 GHz millimeter wave bands.  The resulting simulation capability will provide for radiating the same types of signals as are currently supported, in the above frequency bands. At least one radiation channel is required in each of these bands. The radiated signals in each band must be time correlated, on a pulse-by-pulse basis, with emitters in the other frequency bands.  This upgrade activity will address upgrades to all facets of the system?s capabilities, including the ability to simulate emitters, generate correct RF signals, amplify and radiate signals into free space, and monitor the radiated signals. The expected technical effort includes: developing signal generation and amplification components in the applicable frequency ranges; assembling radiation components (e.g., moveable carts, masts and antennas); implementing upgraded calibration hardware and software; implementing all software, hardware, and firmware changes required to generate simulate signals and control system components; upgrading the existing monitoring capability to support the new frequency bands; installing and testing the system at Edwards AFB; and updating system documentation and drawings. Maximum integration with the existing simulator is required.  Current system design information is limited, and access to documentation of certain components is not available due to the proprietary nature of documents and drawings. Government furnished equipment will be provided as available; however, impacts to facility operations using existing equipment will be minimized. The purpose of this sources sought announcement is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining how this procurement will be acquired. In order to determine if your company can perform the effort, given the constraints of  limited access to critical non-government owned specifications and drawings, we are requesting that each company provide a capability statement, past performance history of similar work, and other information deemed appropriate to assist the Government in making this determination. All documents may be faxed to Alan Wall at 661.275.7885 or mailed to the aforementioned address by 13 May 2002. You may contact Alan Wall at 661.277.8592 if you have questions about this announcement. If we receive no definite information that other offerors can perform this work, this procurement will be advertised on a other than full and open competition basis. Please be advised of the following: This program will involve technology acquisitions that have military applications and are subject to Air Force Materiel Command Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Section 5393, Foreign Disclosure Reviews.

<DESC>SF 254s and SF 255s are being requested from interested firms for Professional surveying services.  The intention is to negotiate indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery contracts.  The contracts will be awarded for a three year contract period.  The services will be provided on a firm-fixed price task order basis with work subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.  As projects become known on each Forest a task order will be issued.  Each contract will have a minimum of $4,000.00 in project fees over the three-year contract period.   The government may award up to four contracts under this solicitation.  Selection of A/E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather on the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of required services.  Location:  Various locations located on the Coconino National Forest, Prescott National Forest and the Williams District of the Kaibab National Forest.  Projects may include any of the following types of work: dependent retracement surveys of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) including mineral surveys and homestead entry surveys, road right-of-way surveys, Small Tracts and Townsite Act surveys, topographic surveys, photogrammetric control or wilderness boundary surveys.  While performing related work the contractor shall include such items as corner search, monumentation, marking/posting the National Forest boundary, control surveys, records and reports, corner maintenance, CAD projects, and land information database entry.  Estimated start date of the contract is approximately July 2002.  The following criteria as set forth in FAR 36.602-1 will be used in conjunction with the specialized selection criteria to assess your firm's qualifications for this project.  Selection of firms for negotiation shall be through an order of preference based on the following criteria: 1) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence:  The Registered Land Surveyor (RLS) demonstrates a complete and thorough understanding of the legal and technical approach needed to perform projects similar to those required by this contract.  The documentation shows sufficient expertise and methodology knowledge to resolve problems relevant and peculiar to the type of projects in question.  2) Geographic Location:  The Arizona Registered Land Surveyor (RLS) designated as being in responsible charge under this contract demonstrates through the SF 254/SF 255 extensive experiences within the contract area.  3) Professional Qualifications:  The RLS demonstrates knowledge of acceptable professional procedures as called for in the Arizona Minimum Survey Standards, the BLM Manual and the GPS Standards and Guidelines jointly adopted by the Forest Service and BLM.  4) Capacity to Accomplish proposed work:  The firm demonstrates they possess a configuration of equipment and personnel sufficient to perform any projects proposed under the contract with respect to: (a) the ability to respond on a short notice for projects of an estimated short duration, (b) the firm's ability to provide CAD assistance, and (c) the firm's ability to provide measurement data linked to the local control datum.  5) Past Performance:  The firm demonstrates successful performance on past contracts within appropriate cost control, schedules and professional guidelines.  6) Cooperation:  The ability of the firm to cooperatively perform work with Forest personnel in order to maximize a collaborative effort and available funding.  This may take the form of selected field search/surveys, measurement computations, CAD drafting or database entry.  7) Contracted Work Clause:  The volume of A&E contracts previously awarded by the Forest Service will be evaluated with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of contracts among the highest qualified firms.  Sole Source and Co-op Contracts will not be considered in this evaluation as A&E contracts.  As part of the evaluation the firms should address under the appropriate criteria the following:  1) Equipment, personnel, standards and methodology proposed for similar projects addressed under this solicitation and  2) Demonstrate the cadastral survey experience of the RLS who will be in responsible charge under this contract.  In addition submit three examples of survey plats that will demonstrate the firm's typical PLSS work addressed in this notice.  Only plats sealed by the listed RLS will be evaluated.  This is a total small business set aside.  The North American Industrial Classification Code is 541370 and the small business size standard is $4.0 million.  Firms interested in this solicitation should submit a SF254, a SF255 and plats to Margaret M. Cook, Contracting Officer, Western Zone Contracting, 2324 E.

<DESC>VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for consultation, investigative services, development of future construction procurement options and strategies, preparation of working drawings and specifications as required, cost estimating, submittal review and other construction period services as necessary for Project Number 528A7-02-755, Replace HVAC Controls at the VA Medical Center, Syracuse, NY.  The purpose of the project is to systematically phase in replacement of all existing, obsolete Johnson Controls (JC) equipment with new, state of the art HVAC controls.  The Medical Center has 44 air handlers, approximately 1200 rooms heated or cooled via radiant ceiling panels and fed with hot or chilled water controlled by sets of 3-way valves and a chiller plant.  The system interfaces with the fire alarm system through individual control panels.  There are five (5) 2-wire control communication trunk cables.  Each trunk feeds one of the five mechanical shafts serving the building.  During the project, all areas of the Medical Center must be completely HVAC controlled at all times.  Our plan is to design the entire HVAC control replacement and phase in construction (material purchase, installation and programming) over several years as funding allows.  The Engineer shall be knowledgeable in state of the art HVAC controllers and make recommendations with cost estimates for options to be considered as well as for a final design.  Consideration will be given to the possible use and upgrade of the existing JC Metasys system.  The Engineer will balance this against the possibility of complete replacement with similar devices from other manufacturers.  One option under consideration is to purchase items off GSA contract and to then contract separately for installation and programming.  In both scenarios, the Engineer will design the entire project in fine detail.  This will include describing the overall plan, creating a detailed listing of each item (including quantity and price) from the GSA contract, totaled by trunk (phase.)  The design will include a detailed description of parts to be provided by the VA and by a contractor to set up the network and convert all the devices on each trunk.  Other options can be proposed by the Engineer during the consultation and investigative phase of the contract.  Existing Johnson Controls DSC and FPU controllers are over 16 years old.  They are failing at increased frequency.  Replacement parts are difficult to locate and are very expensive.  It is also difficult to locate repair contractors who have technicians trained in this obsolete technology.  This technology relied on a host computer (JC DSC 6500) supervising several site or utility specific slave microprocessors.  The slave microprocessors would in turn monitor individual rooms, hallways, and support utilities within the facility.  This technology has been surpassed by microcomputers.  As areas of the Medical Center are renovated, DSCs have been replaced with JC Metasys controllers.  It is anticipated the first construction phase will be to set up (install and program) a new network management system in the Engineering Control Center (ECC) to replace the existing JC85/40 workstation.  It would be our preference to replace the JC85/40 in its entirety with the new system.  Operation of dual systems (old and new) until completion of the final construction phase will be required.  The construction phase will also include the installation of all field devices on the appropriate trunk.  Also included will be 40 hours of technical training on operation and maintenance of the new system.  Subsequent phases will include the installation and programming of all field devices on the remaining trunks.  Installation will include labeling each device and providing detailed “as–built drawings of the entire final system.  Drawings will be CADD generated or readable with Auto Cad 14.  Specifications shall be compiled from VA master specifications that are available on the internet.  Accomplishment of this scope of work must be performed or approved by a registered or licensed architect or engineer as applicable to the nature of the work.  Selection of the Engineering Firm will be based on specialized experience, capability of the firm to perform, professional qualifications of the staff to be assigned to the project, past performance for VA work and/or similar hospital or other projects, and the record of past performance including a comparison between their estimates and actual project awards.  The area of consideration is restricted to firms within a 165 mile radius of the Medical Center.  Appropriate data for this project must be submitted on Standard Forms 254 and 255 no later than May 10, 2002.  Submission should emphasize experience on similar projects with specific emphasis on familiarity with Johnson Controls systems as currently installed at the Syracuse VAMC and the compatibility of this existing system with a new system in a phased replacement approach.  Please provide FIVE copies of any specially bound or color printed material accompanying the Standard Forms.  This is not a request for proposals.  NAICS 541330 applies.  The corresponding size standard is average annual receipts of $4.0M or less.  In accordance with FAR 19.10 and the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, the procurement of the Architect/Engineer contract is a Total Small-Emerging Business Set Aside, making the size standard for this procurement average annual receipts of $2.0M or less.  Total construction cost estimate is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought Notice for a System Integration Contractor for a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Project for Space Exploration Missions.
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking commercial sources with the capability and experience to serve as a System Integration Contractor to design, develop, qualify, and produce Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTGs) for use on future National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space exploration missions. The MMRTG would be suitable for use in various potential NASA space exploration missions, including missions to the surface of Mars (and potentially other planetary bodies) as well as in the vacuum of deep space. The MMRTG would use thermoelectric materials that have demonstrated extended-lifetime and performance, and would be sized for a heat source composed of eight (8) General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) modules to provide 28 volts DC and approximately 110 Watts electric (We) at beginning of mission. Each GPHS module, fueled with plutonium-238 (Pu-238), will provide approximately 250 watts thermal (Wth) at the beginning of mission. The contemplated contractual effort consists of six separate phases. The Phase I effort will be focused on the analysis, design, development, fabrication, and testing of an unfueled Engineering Electrically-heated Thermoelectric Generator (ETG). This phase includes the development of design requirements and specifications for the MMRTG. The Contractor would test the Engineering ETG to support the design basis for the Flight MMRTG. As part of Phase I, the Contractor would demonstrate a qualified thermoelectric component fabrication and production capability to produce thermoelectric components to meet MMRTG design requirements and specifications and proceed to verify their performance, including accelerated testing to determine lifetime performance. The Contractor would develop analytical tools for performing safety analyses and prepare safety analyses to support ongoing NASA National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) activities. The Phase II Option will be focused on the analysis, design, fabrication, and testing of a Qualification ETG that will be used to flight qualify the MMRTG for space missions. Based on the results of Phase I, the design requirements and specifications would be updated. The Contractor would complete the final design, fabricate, and test the Qualification ETG. Also as part of Phase II, the Contractor would demonstrate that the thermoelectric component fabrication process is qualified to produce high quality, uniform thermoelectric components that meet design requirements and specifications for various space exploration environments; fuel and test the Qualification ETG at the DOE fueling and test facility; and continue to perform safety analyses to support NASA?s NEPA activities and prepare a Preliminary Safety Analysis Report (PSAR) to support the interagency launch approval process for use of the MMRTG.  The Phase III-V Options are for the production of Flight ETGs to achieve specific mission objectives. The Contractor would deliver government accepted Flight ETGs to the DOE fueling and test facility. These phases would include the spacecraft integration, preparation of a Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR), and support of the launch approval and ground operations activities. The Phase VI Option will be for a spare Flight MMRTG and may be exercised in concert with the execution of the Phase III, IV, and/or V Options. DOE expects potential sources to have technical engineering expertise and project management capability and experience to: 1. Develop Requirements, Specifications and Test Plans for the Engineering, Qualification, and Flight ETGs and MMRTGs. 2. Develop qualification and acceptance test levels for the ETGs and MMRTGs. 3. Perform structural, thermal, and thermoelectric design analyses of the MMRTG in order to support a definitive design basis in such areas as system response to launch dynamic loads, heat source support preload, thermal interface definition, radiation properties, and handling requirements during and prior to launch. 4. Develop power predictions for various mission profiles, including various launch dates and mission durations. 5. Develop the design and establish engineering documentation for the MMRTGs and ground support equipment. 6. Demonstrate a thermoelectric component manufacturing capability for fabricating thermoelectric materials and thermoelectric components.
