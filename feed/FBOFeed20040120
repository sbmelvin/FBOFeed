<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Tamika Gray, Contract Specialist, (202) 273-6471
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to solicit for VistA Imaging and Maintenance Support services.  This solicitation/procurement is a 100 percent (%) small business set-aside.  All qualified small businesses are encouraged to participate in this competition.  The estimated time frame for issuance of the solicitation is the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 (on or before 10/20/03).  At that time interested small businesses can access the solicitation on line at http://www.bos.oamm.va.gov and the Federal Business Opportunity System at http://www.fedbizopps.com.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541519, Other Computer Related Services; size standard $21 million.   Small businesses exploring teaming and subcontracting arrangements with other potential vendors (i.e. large businesses) should be aware that the proposed small business (serving as the prime contractor) shall complete at a minimum 51 percent (%) of the level of effort required to perform and complete the contract.  This presolicitation notice does not commit the VA to issuing a solicitation in the future.  No response to this announcement is elicited.  Background:  VA’s Chief Information Office introduced VistA in 1996.  VistA is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff.  VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  The Decision Support System (DSS) and other national databases that might be derived from locally generated data lie outside the scope of VistA.  When development began on the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DCHP) in the early 1980s, information systems were in their infancy in VA medical facilities and emphasized primarily hospital-based activities.  DHCP grew rapidly and is used by many private and public health care facilities throughout the United States and the world.  Although, DHCP represented the total automation activity at most VA medical centers in 1985, DHCP is now only one part of the overall information resources at the local facility level.  VistA incorporates all of the benefits of DHCP as well as including the rich array of other information resources that are becoming vital to the day-to-day operations at the VA medical facilities.  It represents the culmination of DHCP’s evolution and metamorphosis into a new, open system, client-server based environment that takes full advantage of commercial solutions, including those provided by Internet technologies.  Place of Contract Performance:  Washington Metropolitan Area.  Set-aside Status:  100 Percent (%)Small Business Set-aside.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement  for NAVWAR Enhancements to the Global Positioning System (GPS) Background: The Global Positioning System (GPS) is widely used as a source of position, velocity, and time on U.S. military platforms. However, GPS signal power is low which makes it vulnerable to interference.  The GPS Joint Program Office (JPO) established the Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) program in 1996 to address the Electronic Warfare (EW) threat to the GPS system. The NAVWAR program was tasked with protecting Department of Defense (DoD) and allied use of GPS during times of conflict, preventing its use by adversaries, and maintaining normal availability to civilian users outside the area of conflict. Scope The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC-SD) is soliciting innovative basic and applied research and prototype development proposals to support the NAVWAR program. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (a) GPS antenna & antenna electronics technologies (e.g. Handheld GPS AJ appliqués, Small multi-element arrays, multiple beam steering implementations and algorithms, MEMS filters, etc.) (b) GPS receiver technologies and algorithms (e.g. Multi-path mitigation, M-Code carrier phase tracking, Ultra-tight GPS/INS Coupling, Software Communications Architecture (SCA) / Software Defined Radio (SDR) / Fully Coherent Receivers, Integrity algorithms, etc.) (c) Micro-Electromechanical System (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) integration with GPS antennas (d) GPS signal data recording, storage and playback The GPS JPO supports a wide variety of platforms for the entire U.S. Department of Defense, ranging from individual soldiers to aircraft carriers.  The categories identified above have been purposefully left broad so as not to limit proposals that would have applicability on any or all of these platforms.  In FY04, the GPS JPO is particularly (but not exclusively) interested in efforts involving the integration of MEMS IMUs into beam-forming and null-steering GPS antennas. The awards under this program will be to those organizations proposing innovative research approaches that can be expected to lead to, or enable revolutionary advances in, the state-of-the-art (this includes follow-on efforts, if the effort continues to be significantly ahead of the state-of the-art). Proposers are encouraged to team with DoD and other government laboratories and/or agencies in the research, development, and technology demonstration phases.  Proposed projects may include theory or operational concept development.  Offerors are encouraged to provide evidence that supports the physical demonstration of a product. This evidence lends technical merit to the selection process.  Where research is expected to produce one or more prototypes, the Government may elect for contractual options that provide for delivery of several such prototype systems to facilitate the transfer of technology This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will remain active for five years. White papers will be accepted throughout the life of the BAA.  To stimulate interest in submitting proposals and to provide updated guidance on the current priorities of the GPS JPO, this announcement will be updated and re-issued each year. Authority 10 USC Sec. 2358 Research and Development Projects 10 USC Sec. 2371 Research Projects: Transactions Other Than Contracts and Grants SSC-SD intends to enter into cooperative agreements, contracts, grants or ?other transactions? with qualified sources to perform research development, integration, test and evaluation of advanced technology within guidelines of FAR 35.016.  It is possible to fund none of the proposals, or funding permitting, fund all the proposals.  It is also possible to fund part of the proposals.  Each individual white paper and proposal is reviewed on its own merit.  Proposals will be evaluated individually as selectable or non-selectable for funding based on the evaluation criteria set forth in this BAA. Points of Contact Questions of a contractual nature shall be directed to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Oralee Martin, (619) 553-5347, email: oralee.martin@navy.mil or Contracting Officer Mr. James E. Smith, (619) 553-7504, email:  james.e.smith@navy.mil. White Paper Submittal Offerors are invited to submit white papers.  If a proposed area of research and the accompanying approach is considered potentially valuable and within funding limits, SSC-SD will then request a full proposal. White papers are limited to three pages, including all figures, tables and attachments. Reviewers will not load software or simulations in the conduct of white paper reviews. However, web sites containing concise simulations or other information not readily represented in the static format of a document may be hyperlinked from the white paper. Innovative approaches to information presentation are encouraged.  The white paper shall include: (1) a clear statement of the problem to be solved; (2) a rational for the proposed work; (3) an overview of the approach to be taken; (4) a general assessment of the value gained if the work is successful; (5) a specific description of the product and its anticipated utility, (6) a milestone schedule; and (7) a cost estimate. White papers exceeding $3 million will not be accepted.  SSC-SD will acknowledge receipt of white papers, and will notify offerors whether a full proposal is requested. All White Papers and Proposals shall be UNCLASSIFIED As funding for this BAA will likely fluctuate by year, the government would prefer that any multi-year efforts adopt a phased approach in which specific deliverables are identified for each year.  Offerors are encouraged to submit individual proposals for any work that could stand on its own, rather than integrating diverse tasks into a single more complicated proposal. White papers shall include the name, address, voice phone number, facsimile number, and email address of the proposing organization and the principal point of contact, and of other organizations participating as part of the research team. Full Proposal Submittal Full proposals, if requested, shall consist of two volumes:  Volume I for the technical proposal and management approach and Volume II for cost. Volume I is limited to 30 single-sided pages (not including resumes).  The contents of Volume I shall amplify the ideas outlined in its preceding white paper. Volume I shall include the following sections, each starting on a new page: (A) A cover page, including title, technical and administrative points of contact with telephone and facsimile numbers and Internet addresses. (B) A one-page summary of the innovative claims for the proposed research. (C) A one-page summary of deliverables. (D) A one-page summary of schedule and milestones. (E) A one-page summary of any proprietary claims to results, prototypes or systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of research, results and/or a prototype.  If there are no proprietary claims, this section shall consist of a statement to that effect. (F) A Statement of Work clearly detailing the scope, objectives, and approach of the effort.  Optional work shall be distinguishable from the baseline effort.  If any portion of the research is predicated upon the use of Government Owned Resources of any type, the proposal shall clearly identify the Resource required, the date the Resource is required, the duration of the requirement, the source from which the Resource may be acquired, if known, and the impact on the research if the Resource is not provided. (G) Technical arguments that substantiate claims made in section (B) and a technical approach description consistent with sections (C) and (D). (H) A description of the results and products expected from the effort. (I) A discussion of no more than three pages giving previous accomplishments and work in this or closely related areas, and the qualifications of the investigators. (J) A discussion no more than five pages long that describes the overall approach to the management of this effort, including brief discussions of total organization, use of personnel, project/function/subcontractor relationships, technology transition plans, government research interfaces, and planning, scheduling and control practice. There is no page limitation for Volume II.  Volume II shall include a cost and fee summary for the effort, inclusive of any proposed options, and a detailed cost breakdown.  The cost and fee summary should indicate manpower levels of effort, equipment and supplies, travel, and miscellaneous expenses for the tasks and subtasks for the entire effort.  Details of any cost sharing to be undertaken by the offeror must be included in Volume II.  The cost and fee summary shall be supported by a detailed breakdown by task and sub task of labor hours by labor category and level of effort, materials by vendor quotes and purchase history, travel estimates, computer costs and other direct and indirect costs. An explanation of any estimating factors, including their derivation and application shall be provided.  Volume II should include all supporting data in order to allow for a complete review by the Government. Selection and Evaluation Criteria It is the policy of SSC-SD to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive evaluations of all proposals and to select the source (or sources) whose offer(s) meets the Government technical and policy goals.  In order to provide the desired evaluation, two or more qualified Government personnel will conduct a technical review of each submission and will convene panels of Government experts in the appropriate areas when necessary.  The consolidated reports produced during these reviews will be provided to the Contracting/Grants Officer.  These reports will indicate those offerors with whom negotiations and/or discussions should be conducted.  That will also include questions arising from the reviews and, when appropriate issues that need to be resolved prior to award. White papers and proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common statement of work.  SSC-SD?s intent is to review white papers and full proposals as soon as practicable after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons. White papers will be evaluated utilizing the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (1) Overall scientific and technical merit; (2) Potential contributions and relevance to SSC-SD mission in relation to meeting the objectives of the Navigation Warfare Program being managed by the GPS JPO, which is the sponsor for this effort; (3) Cost realism and an assessment of the value being received for the proposed cost.

Proposals may be submitted at any time until the final proposal deadline of 1645 PST, January 15, 2009, however the first round of evaluations will require white papers to be submitted by 19 February 2004, 1645 PST.  All copies (except one file copy) of non-selectable proposals and all copies of working papers will be destroyed.  Individual review sheets and other products of the review process other than official documentation of the review will be retained for a period of two years from the close of the BAA at which time they will be destroyed. Technical Data If a contract is awarded, the Government?s preference is to obtain unlimited rights (as defined by DFARS 252.227-7013 ?Rights in Technical Data - Noncommercial Items? and 252.227-7014 ?Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation?) to the results and products of this research.

Other Information Contracts made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract numbers.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined at FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in description.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)  with the University of Colorado - Boulder, Dept. of Physics 572 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309-0572 to perform electromechanical measurements of the effect of axial and transverse stress on the critical current of high-Tc and low-Tc superconductors. The goal is to determine the stress sensitivity of new experimental coated conductors as well as to obtain data for the characterization of high-field Nb3Sn superconductors for high-energy-physics-accelerator magnets. Another major project will be to develop and commission a rather complex magnetoresistance probe to analyze field dependent electrical conductivity in carbon nanostructures. The measurements are to be performed using specially designed NIST cryostats. The contractor must have a combination of skills and past experience in cryogenic probe design, handling of cryogenic fluids, and operation of both high and low current sources. Knowledge of conducting properties of both superconductors and carbon nanostructures and their interpretation/explanation are essential. Specific work tasks include measuring the effect of axial strain and transverse stress on the critical-current of brittle superconducting materials, and commissioning and testing an apparatus for magnetoresistance measurements of nanostructures. In the case of superconductors, analysis of the data will be performed in terms of the Strain Scaling Law and deviatoric strain models, and in the case of carbon nanostructures, initial results with the new probe should clarify issues on (directional) superficial conductivity at the walls of nanotubes, and possibly on ballistic conductivity.  The project completion date is  June 30, 2004.***This simplified acquisition (NTE $100K) is being conducted under the authority of FAR Part 13.  No solicitation is available.  Responses to this notice must be received no later than February 4, 2004 and will be evaluated solely to determine if a competitive procurement process will be in the Government's best interest.  FAR provisions in full text are available online at http://www.arnet.gov/far/ including requirements for registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Inquiries or responses should be submitted in writing to Doris Turner, Purchasing Agent, via email at doris.p.turner@noaa.gov or by fax at 303-497-3163.  Any source that believes it can supply the required service should respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirement within 15 days of this notice.  Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/#REFERENCE.  The anticipated award date is February 7, 2004.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 54135   Request for Price Quotes:                                             Hourly Rate plus Expenses                                          	STATEMENT OF WORK 	Field Support for Western Wyoming 	Public Water System Regulatory Program Purpose 	The purpose of this contract  is to procure field services for the Wyoming public water system (PWS) regulatory program in the western and southwestern sections of Wyoming. Background 	The National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (40 CFR Part 141) require all public water systems (PWSs) to routinely monitor for  microbiological, chemical and radionuclide contaminants, and to meet certain treatment technique requirements.  The PWS regulatory program for Wyoming is implemented by the U. S. EPA Region 8 office in Denver, Colorado. 	As the implementing agency for the Wyoming PWS regulatory program, EPA  Region 8 has several responsibilities.  Some of these require personnel to make site visits to Wyoming PWSs, or conduct  meetings with Wyoming's state and local environmental or public health agency officials.   For example: (1)	EPA is required to ensure that sanitary surveys are conducted at  each PWS within specified regulatory time-frames.  A sanitary survey is a thorough on-site review of PWS facilities, operation, maintenance and management that emphasizes technical assistance rather than enforcement.  Sanitary surveys also require collection and interpretation of select information  before the on-site visit. (2)	As part of a technical assistance effort, EPA Regional staff or contractors may collect water samples for microscopic particulate analysis (MPA).  These MPA samples are used to determine whether a PWS using a ground water source might be "under the direct influence of  surface water." (3)	When a PWS is having problems with microbiological, chemical, or radionuclide contamination, the operator often asks EPA for assistance in correcting the problem.  The assistance may necessitate a visit to the PWS. (4)	There may be some small water systems in Wyoming that meet  the definition of a public water system, but have not notified or been recognized by EPA.  These systems need to be identified and their names entered into the PWS regulatory database at EPA. (5)	There have been several new Safe Drinking Water Act amendments enacted with new requirements for  public water systems.  Water system operators may need on-site technical assistance and training to comply with the new requirements. (6)	Some state, county, and local environmental and public health agencies also have regulatory authority that applies to water systems in Wyoming.  On occasion,  staff 	from these agencies have requested training on drinking water topics.  It is in the interest of EPA Region 8 to provide this training to help ensure that all agencies work together in a coordinated manner. (7)	On occasion, it is necessary to confirm that a PWS has actually completed all the  steps necessary to allow it to be "deactivated" (i.e., no longer meets the legal definition of a "public water system").  It is also occasionally necessary to confirm that a PWS has completed all of the actions mandated in an administrative order.  In both instances, the best way to make these  confirmations is to visit the facility, take photographs, and possibly collect water samples. (8)	As appropriate, EPA Region 8 also investigates problems at private residences, or at facilities too small to meet the legal definition of a public water system.  Regional staff provide technical  assistance to help these small water systems correct any water quality problems. 	Because EPA Region 8 offices are located in Denver, it is difficult to send Agency  personnel to Wyoming in every instance one of these actions are needed.  For this              reason, the Region is soliciting  proposals from contractors to perform this work. The majority of the work will be located in the western and southwestern sections of Wyoming. Responsibilities 	The contractor will receive written (FAXed or e-mailed) assignments from the contract's Work Assignment Manager or their  designee from  the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit for the some or all of the following four tasks: (1)	Site visits to public water systems to conduct sanitary surveys. 	At the beginning of the contract year, the Work Assignment Manager or their  designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit will  send the contractor a list of Wyoming PWSs that must have sanitary surveys completed.  After receiving the list, the contractor will conduct the sanitary surveys at the assigned facilities and prepare a written report for each one.  The scheduling of these survey visits is left to the discretion of  the contractor.  However, EPA reserves the right to designate certain surveys as "high priority".  "High priority" surveys must be completed as soon as possible.  All of the sanitary survey visits must be completed by the end of the purchase order.  	The contractor will prepare a written report  for each sanitary survey.  The reports must have the following features: ?	They must use the current  standardized format specified by EPA Region 8, and  must be provided in Microsoft Word or WordPerfect format. ?	They must include at least one color photo of each source, treatment and storage  facility at the public water system. ?	They must include an updated schematic of the PWS, which shows any changes made in system configurations.  EPA Region 8 will provide the contractor with a paper copy of each schematic before the contractor makes the site visit.  It is then the responsibility  of the contractor to mark-up the schematic as appropriate, and get the PWS operator's signature on the page (to confirm that he/she agrees with the changes). ?	The text at the beginning of the report (the "summary" section) must include a brief summary of any deficiencies found at the facility,  and  recommendations on how to correct them. ?	For each sanitary survey completed at public water systems that use ground water, the contractor must fill out a "ground water under the direct influence of surface water" screening form.  The screening form will be provided by EPA. ?	For each  sanitary survey, the contractor must mark-up a PWS inventory summary form that will be provided by EPA. ?	Latitude/longitude measurements will be collected only if there has never been a measurement previously determined for a system's source(s), treatment facility(ies), and/or storage tank(s).   Measurements will only be recorded on the PWS inventory summary sheet.  The contractor must demonstrate to the Work Assignment Manager that they can collect latitude/longitude measurements to within 25 meters of accuracy. ?	Each sanitary survey report must be e-mailed to the contract's Work  Assignment Manager within 30 days after the site visit.  The accompanying photos can either be e-mailed (e.g., those from a digital camera) as a separate file attachment, or mailed.  The hand-corrected PWS schematics, inventory summary sheets, and any other pertinent information collected during  the survey, e.g. treatment equipment manufacturer's spec sheets,  must be mailed back to the Work Assignment Manager. ?	If, during a sanitary survey visit, the contractor discovers conditions at a public water system that could pose an immediate risk to public health, he/she will immediately  contact the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit by telephone to provide a report of the situation.  The contractor will also give highest priority to the completion of the sanitary survey report and relaying it to the Work Assignment Manager by  e-mail. ?	There may be occasion when a representative of the EPA, state, county, or local agencies will accompany the contractor during a sanitary survey.  In these instances, the contractor will still be responsible for the completion of the sanitary survey report. (2)	Site visits to public  water systems to collect drinking water samples for microscopic particulate analysis.  After receiving a written work request from the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit, the contractor will collect the MPA samples using the protocols specified in  the "EPA Consensus Method."  Each sample takes approximately 8 - 10 hours to collect.  Once the sample is collected, the contractor will package it and either hand-deliver or mail it to a certified laboratory (one that has been approved by EPA to conduct the analysis).  For each site visit, the  contractor will prepare a brief (i.e., no more than one page) report using a form approved by EPA.  The reports will be sent to EPA within 30 days after the site visits.  (NOTE: The public water system pays the lab costs for the MPA analysis.  It is understood that the lab may send the results to  EPA later than the 30-day deadline.) (3)	Technical assistance visits to public water systems that are having problems.  After receiving a work request verbally or in writing from the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit, the contractor will visit a  facility to provide technical assistance.  Examples of possible problems include microbiological contamination in the system; failure to maintain adequate disinfectant residual; and failure to meet the Surface Water Treatment Rule turbidity criteria.  The contractor will assess the problem and  offer suggestions on how to make corrections. 	For each site visit, the contractor will prepare a brief report (i.e., no more than 2 pages) for EPA.  These reports will include findings and suggestions on how to correct problems at the facility.  The reports will be sent to EPA within 30 days  	after the site visit. 	On occasion, the contractor may receive a written request to visit a water system that does not meet the legal definition of a public water system, but requires technical assistance to address drinking water problems.  In these instances, the contractor will visit the  facility, offer advice on how to correct the problem, and prepare a brief report for the Work Assignment Manager. (4)	Identification of potential PWSs that are not currently on EPA's inventory of regulated systems.  This task can be accomplished while traveling to assigned sites.  Here, the  contractor is requested to watch for any new facility developments that might meet the definition of a public water system, and to report these systems to EPA.  (EPA will provide the contractor with a current list of existing PWSs.) (5)	Training and technical assistance on SDWA Amendments.  After  receiving a written work request from the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from 	the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit, the contractor will provide training or technical assistance to PWSs that are striving to meet new drinking water regulatory requirements.  After each training or  technical assistance visit, the 	contractor will send the Work Assignment Manager written confirmation (preferably an e-mail) that the assignment was completed and a description of the training provided. (6)	Training for state and local agency personnel.  At the written request of the Work  Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit, the contractor will conduct one or more training sessions for state and local agency personnel on selected drinking water topics.  Examples include:  collecting total coliform samples; chemical monitoring  requirements for PWSs. (7)	Site visits to confirm completion of specified actions.  After receiving a work request verbally or in writing from the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit, the contractor will visit 	PWS facilities, take photos and  collect other pertinent information to confirm that a PWS has completed the actions either: (1) mandated in a administrative order; or (2) necessary to allow that PWS to be deactivated.  The contractor will send EPA a summary report within 30 days after the visit. Request for Price Quotes (Hourly  Rate plus Expenses): 	EPA will review and evaluate proposals and make the contract award based upon the applicant's ability to meet the EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA, stated below.  This program is competitive, and eligible applicants that can demonstrate that they meet the Criteria may apply.  	EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA 	All proposals will be evaluated according to the following criteria.  1.	Demonstrated experience of the applicant in conducting sanitary surveys. 2.	Experience and knowledge of water system operations and maintenance, and small government public works  administration. 3.	Because some drinking water facility problems can be an emergency public health concern, technical assistance may be required on 24 hours notice.  Therefore, preference will be given to companies or offices located within the Wyoming state boundaries. 4.	Cost:  Please provide  the fully loaded hourly rate for each task listed above   If the contract has multiple hourly rates, list the hours per each rate. 5.	List any subcontractors that will be used for this contract, including their experience in the criteria listed above.   6.	Familiarity with the National Primary  Drinking Water Regulations   (40 CFR Part 141). End of Contract Reporting 	At the end of the contract period, the contractor will prepare a brief (i.e. 2-3 pages) report summarizing how many tasks were completed under each of the areas of responsibility listed above.  Additional reporting  requirements are specified under specific areas of responsibility. Additional Requirements (1)	For all site visits, the contractor will inform the PWS operator that they are contract employees (not EPA employees) who have been hired by EPA to provide various forms of technical assistance.  Due to  increased security considerations, contractors should carry and present EPA credentials at the time of their visit to the PWS.  At all times, the contractor will be courteous to the PWS operators and will suggest, but not insist, that the PWS operators follow advice given during the visit.  (2)	If  the contractor observes that a PWS is not complying with any of the drinking water regulations or, if conditions at the facility pose an immediate public health risk, the contractor will immediately inform the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems  Unit. (3)	Some verbal or written work requests will require an expedited response, particularly in the case of drinking water emergencies. (4)	All work performed by the contractor will be done in accordance with pertinent Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements. (5)	EPA may  require the contractor to travel to Denver near the beginning of the contract year to meet staff and review files of facilities where sanitary survey visits will be conducted. Past performance 	Provide three (3) of the most relevant and related references for similar work in terms of size and  scope over the past three years.  Provide the following information: (a) the name and address of the organization for which services were performed; (b) the current telephone number of a responsible technical representative of the organization and the current business contact; (c) the contract  number, if applicable; (d) the type of contract performed; and (e) a brief description of the services provided, including the length of performance and the total dollar amount. QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS 	Contractors shall prepare a succinct written proposal that addresses the work  described in the Statement of Work (technical approach), a schedule of deliverables and a budget.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Big Sky Laser/Quantel (Bozeman, MT) under authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 for the purchase of a Brilliant Pulsed Nd;YAG Laser System with high energy THG package and rack mounted power supply. EPA has determined that the Brilliant Laser system is the only known laser on the market that has a high enough power rating (355 nm) that can supply energy at a specific wavelength to allow for ionization functions. Moreover, its compact size and rack mounted power supply are essential because the instrument will be  used in field studies, which requires mobility.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA source research indicates Big Sky Laser is the only source able to satisfy the Government's requirements. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical  documentation to establish the potential of offering an equivalent laser.  Such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the  Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is  334516. The anticipated award date is 12/20/03. Interested parties should submit documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following methods: by fax to 513.487.2109, or by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing solicitation RFQ-OH-04-00029.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Grantee Contact: The Chief Executive - Railways, The Central East African Railways Company Limited (CEAR), Station Road, P. O. Box 5144, Limbe, Malawi, Phone:  011-265-1-640-844, Fax:  011-265-1-643-496  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a rail extension and inland terminal project in Zambia and Malawi.  

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has provided a grant to the Central East African Railways Company Limited (CEAR), a private company incorporated in Malawi, to work with a U.S. company to carry out the Chipata Rail Extension and Inland Terminal Project Feasibility Study.  The feasibility study would explore the extension of the Nacala Corridor, which connects Malawi to the Port of Nacala, Mozambique, from its existing western termination point near the town of Mchinji in Malawi to a point at or near the first eastern town across the Malawi/Zambia border, Chipata.  This would allow CEAR to market its services to potential customers in eastern Zambia and thereby increase the traffic through the corridor to and from the Nacala Port.  In order to facilitate the transfer of freight between the railway and industry at Chipata, the project may require the construction of a dry freight terminal to be feasible.  Such a terminal at or near Chipata would handle both container and bulk freight transfers, including rail-to-truck and truck-to-rail transfers, for the import and export of goods within and to the corridor.

A summary of the Study’s Terms of Reference (TOR) is as follows:

1.	A review of existing documentation
2.	A traffic, market, and revenue analysis
3.	A review of available construction materials
4.	A cost analysis for repair of existing infrastructure
5.	A review of documentation regarding land use and ownership
6.	A review of customs regulations between Malawi and Zambia
7.	An assessment of the cost and location for an inland terminal
8.	A cost analysis for the construction of a new rail line and supporting facilities
9.	A complete environmental impact assessment
10.	A determination of operational costs associated with the rail and container terminal over a 30-year period
11.	A review of the legal and regulatory framework
12.	An assessment of development impact and benefits
13.	Preparation of a detailed implementation schedule
14.	Preparation of a final report according to USTDA standards



The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $210,450 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM (local time), March 5, 2004, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment #1 is to post questions and answers related to this procurement.

Question 1.  We have described variance between consumables for pipettes and tips. There is no 300ul tips specified for 50-300ul 8-ch. pipettor. Should we consider the specs of pipettor as 50-200ul. 

Answer: We need tips of ranges up to 300ul. The specification is changed from “Tips, STERILE, 20-200 ul - 1000/pk - 6” to “Tips, STERILE, 50ul (or less)—300ul – 1000/pk – 6”

Question 2.  Please clarify the type of microplate reader that is required.  In the last bid, there was a reader with on board software (in russian language, english, etc). You may recall that in our last bid, the spec called for a reader with on board software for data analysis.  One advantage was that the language choice included Russian.

In this bid, it doesn't specify whether the reader should be computer controlled or have on board software for use without a computer.  If it is intended for use with a computer, what type of software do you want.  For example, will you do curve fitting, what type, report types desired, etc.  What language should the software be in?  What kind of computer will it need to run on?  What type of printer will you use?  What file formats are required?  The software specification for microplate readers is much more complicated than the reader itself.

Perhaps you simply want to control the reader from Microsoft excel and capture the raw data.  Please let us know the details.  When responding to a bid such as this one, if you follow the letter of the bid, you will end up with a reader that cannot be used without a computer and the software required to control it, because the reader alone is the least expensive and that is all that the bid calls for.

Answer: On-board LCD, and ports for PC interface, and printer output; Windows-capable, with user-definable protocol; Software: Courve fits, and endpoint screening assay; Self-test; Manual and automatic plate layout, control and assay validation, cutoff criteria, data analysis; Lab technical and/or service manuals (operating instructions, installation, maintenance) in Russian. 

Question 3.   No capacity requirement is listed for the centrifuge do you have a minimum number of tubes that you would need?

Answer: Centrifuge must accommodate at least 6 tubes. 

 

Question 4.  The cylinders listed do not specify glass but I am assuming glass is needed?

Answer: Cylinders should NOT be glass.  They must be polystyrene or polymethylpentene.
tion marks?
Answer:   (1) Cylinders; Polypropylene or Polymethylpentene; Graduated with 1.0 mL subdivisions; Error limit: < or = 1.0 mL.  (2) Cylinders, 1000 ml; Polypropylene or Polymethylpentene; Graduated with 10.0 mL subdivisions; Error limit: < or = 6.0 mL

Question 8: Please provide the specifications on the centrifuge tubes - conical, constructed of what material, graduated, sterile/nonsterile, etc? 
Answer:   Conical leakproof polypropylene or polystyrene tubes, 15mL, clear or translucent, with polypropylene, polystyrene or polyethylene plug seal cap, nonsterile, graduation marks not necessary
 
Question 9: Specifications for the item listed as CENTRIFUGES. At a minimum, we would need- RPM speed, fixed or variable speed, rotor type, number of places and number of tubes, size of tubes to be spun, timer and range, any other requirements.   
Answer:  Centrifuge for Serum Separation, Speed range: 0-3200 rpm or greater; Maximum Relative Centrifugal Force: 1,212 x g or greater; Timer: at least 30 min in 5 min increments; Tubes accepted: 2-15 mL (or broader; tube holder adjusters must be supplied); Rotor: angled
  
Question 10:  Can you please indicate where we may find 22CFR228.51?  Could you advise where we may find an explanation of the meaning of the following paragraph; or, could you offer an explanation, please?  Origin (country of manufacture) of each product.   The Authorized Geographic Codes for this contract are 000 (United States) and 110 (independent countries of the former Soviet Union).   If a 000 or 110-origin product is not available, the offeror must provide an explanation and request a waiver in accordance with 22CFR228.51.  The origin of the products we could offer differ from the codes 000 or 110. Could we still proceed with our products? 
Answer: 22CFR 228.51 may be found at the following link: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_01/22cfr228_01.html
It is a Federal Regulation that specifies administrative practice and procedures regarding Source, Origin and Nationality of USAID-financed commodities and services.  For this solicitation, products manufactured in and shipped from countries in Geographic Codes 000 and 110 are being sought.  However, if one of the required products is not manufactured in any of the authorized countries, then the offeror may propose a product manufactured elsewhere, with an explanation and request for a waiver of the geographic restriction.  There is no prescribed format or form for a waiver request. For example, if there is no company in the United States or the independent countries of the former Soviet Union that manufactures an incubator that meets the solicitation’s specifications, then an offeror may propose a product manufactured elsewhere.  Geographic code 000 is defined as USA. Geographic Code 110 is defined as New Independent States - Collective for New Independent States of the former Soviet Union.
 
Question 11. NAICS code is 541990. Does it mean that the company whose business status is not applicable to this code could not send their offers? 
Answer:  The code is intended to describe the product or service, not the seller.    
 
Question 12: For some of the countries in question, standard freight delivery services will not deliver palletized goods to the US embassy. Since the bid calls for a delivery cost to the US embassy in each of the countries mentioned, is one able to quote the delivery cost to the airport only, if obvious carriers such as Federal Express will not deliver palletized goods directly to the embassy? 
Answer: 16 sets of equipment must be consigned to USAID/CDC,  American Embassy, Almaty, Kazakhstan.  19 sets of equipment must be consigned to USAID/CDC,  American Embassy, Tashkent, Uzbekistan.  Freight costs should include the cost of local delivery from the port of entry to a warehouse, exact location TBD, within Almaty and Tashkent.  USAID will arrange for duty and tax-free customs clearance at ports of entry.  
 
Question 13: Is used equipment acceptable? 
Answer: No.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification #2 is to make changes and additions in the specifications, to change the shipping requirements, to extend the deadline for submission of offers, and to respond to Questions.   
1.  The Specification for the Automated Microplate Washer is changed.  The requirement for 16 channels is deleted.    
2. Offers shall provide price for shipping equipment to USAID/CDC,  American Embassy, Almaty, Kazakhstan (16 sets), and USAID/CDC, American Embassy, Tashkent, Uzbekistan (19 sets), quoted both for shipment via air freight, and via surface. Delivery is due within 90 days from the effective date of award.  The equipment shall be consigned to the USAID/CDC, US Embassies in these countries. 
3.  Offers are due at 10 AM, Almaty time on October 6, 2003. 
4.  Questions and Answers: 
Question 1: The specification for the microplate washer calls for 8, 12 and 16 channel manifolds.  Does this mean that you would like an 8, 12, and 16 channel manifolds (all 3)  included with the proposal?  Or simply that the washer should have the capability of using these 3 types of manifolds?   
Answer: The washer must be compatible with both 8 and 12 channel manifolds, and must include both. (16 channel capacity is not needed).
Question 2:  Under the pipette tip section, there is no mention of whether the tips are to be bulk (in a bag), box racked,  box rack sterile or rack packs.  What racking configuration is required? Box Racked 200ul and P2/P10 style tips come 960/unit traditionally to accommodate microtitre spacing, not 1000 per unit as is mentioned in the specification.  1000ul tips do come 1000 per unit in both bulk and box racks.  It would be very inconvenient to use the multichannel pipettors mentioned in the solicitation with bagged bulk pipette tips.
Answer: The tips should be bulk, and hence will be nonsterile (we had specified STERILE in the posting). While we realize that it may be less convenient to use the multichannel pipettors mentioned in the solicitation with bulk pipette tips, given the cost difference, the inconvenience is far outweighed by the cost savings.
 
Question 3.  In the RFP it mentions the option of a two step water system with RO or distillation on the front end and a cartridge based polishing system on the back end.  Can you please clarify this?  Is a two step system required (RO or distillation on the front end) or if another configuration will satisfy the requirements, would it be acceptable?  Since it mentions the option of a two step system, would it be possible to offer two choices in water systems? One a classic two step and perhaps a second alternative, without being judged as not having properly responded to the solicitation? 
Answer: The two-step water purification process in the subject RFP was an example of one possible configuration.  The water purification system proposed by the offeror must be capable of producing analytical grade ultrapure water, as stated in solicitation document.  Offerors may propose alternative water purification systems, bearing in mind that price is the most important selection factor.  
 
Question 4.  For the Cryovials mentioned in the RFP, is a silicone seal required?
Answer: A silicone seal is NOT required for the cryovials.
 
Question 5:  Do the displays and printouts from the instruments have to be in Russian or is the requirement that just the manuals be in Russian. 
Answer: The displays and printouts do NOT need to be in Russian, as long as the Russian-language manuals show the English words which would be in displays, and explains the meaning in Russian.  For example, if the display reads Error 6A, the manual should explain the meaning of Error 6A in Russian.  
 
Question 6: What is the speed range for the shaker/rotator in RPM?
Answer: Orbital, variable speed, 100-1500 RPM.  
 
Question 7: Please advise what material the cylinders are to be made from - glass, plastic (what type, ie PMP, PP, PE, etc) and the error limits, gradua

<SUBJECT>A--Low Cost Ferroelectric Phase Shifters for Phased Arrays Clarification to BAA DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0401
<SOLNBR>DAAB07-03-R-P650
<RESPDATE>030504
<ARCHDATE>05042004
<CONTACT>Charles Ade, (732) 427-1334
<DESC>Low Cost Ferroelectric Phase Shifters for Phased Arrays Clarification to BAA DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0401 See the US Army CECOM Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at abob.monmouth.army.mil under BAA DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0401, Amendment A00006  MS Word attachment for fine details or clarifications to the description of this Topic reflected below.  1.1 ARMY NEED:  The Army is pursuing technologies to meet transformation goals of a lighter, faster, more lethal force with integrated on-the-move communications from sensor to shooter.  Affordable Phased Arrays provide the means for this high data rate, B eyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS), on-the-move communications.  The Army Objective Force and Transformational Communications Architecture require small, low profile, affordable, mobile SATCOM terminals. The major contributor to the cost of phased array antennas i s the current high cost ($50-100) of packaged Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) phase shifters.  Ferroelectric phase shifters provide a low cost option for these costly items. The successful completion of this ManTech program will result in a cost reduction of up to 33% for SATCOM and UAV phased arrays for FCS and WIN-T operating in the K, Ka and Q frequency bands.  PM efforts affected include the WIN-T communications vehicle an d PM WIN-T Multifunction Integrated SATCOM Terminal (MIST).  Neither of these efforts will be able to utilize phased array antenna systems without the cost reductions provided by this ManTech program. 1.2 TECHNICAL CONCEPT:  This ManTech program leverages and builds upon DARPA, ARL and CECOM programs addressing the development of ferroelectric phase shifters.  Specific programs include the DARPA Frequency Agile Materials for Electronics (FAME) program, the ARL SBIR program for development of ferroelectric phase shifters, and a subcontract for ferroelectric phase shifters under the CECOM DUST (Dual Use Science & Technology) program for low cost phased arrays (STO IV.G.07, Antennas Across the Spectrum and STO IIII.C4.2001.02, Advanced Antennas).  These efforts, however, only address the initial development of ferroelectric phase shifters.  This ManTech program is expected to reduce costs by establishing cost effective manufacturing methods and techniques of  fabrication and packaging. Specific goals of this ManTech program are to:  Ã‚Â·	Improve device design and fabrication processes Ã‚Â·	Reduce device application voltage Ã‚Â·	Reduce loss of ferroelectric devices from 9 dB to  5 dB Ã‚Â·	Develop low cost packaging techniques Ã‚Â·	Package-less solder bump bonded ferroelectric phase shifter Ã‚Â·	Increase operational lifetime to  20 years Ã‚Â·	Reduce phase shifter device cost from $50 to $10. 1.3 BENEFITS:  This effort will yield significantly less expensive (from  $50 to  $10) phase shifters for phased array antennas.  Additionally, it will identify potential low-cost technologies for robust, mobile, embedded antenna systems that can replace t he current high-cost solutions.  These cost reductions will help reduce antenna costs to a level where it becomes practical to utilize these antennas extensively in tactical communications systems.  The ultimate goal of this ManTech program is to make the procurement costs of Phased Array Antenna systems feasible for the WIN-T and FCS communications architectures (including FCS UoA (Unit of Action) and UoE (Unit of Employment) vehicles with embedded SATCOM).  These antenna systems will provide a new high da ta rate, On-The-Move communications capability via Satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  (This capability is specifically addressed in the WIN-T ORD and the FCS Block II requirements.)  Affordable phased array antennas are a key component of the Transf ormation Communications (TC) terminal technology insertion/phasing plans.  As part of TCS, the Transformational SATCOM (TSAT) terminals include the technology insertion of phased array antennas in the 2005 -  2009 time frame.  Having phased array antennas in these terminals will increase communications capability and decrease the probability of enemy detection/identification because of their smaller, conformal profile. This ManTech program will develop low cost materials, novel techniques and manufacturing processes that can be applied to high volume production of ferroelectric materials/devices for phased array antennas.  The On-the-Move SATCOM and UAV communication systems enabled by this program represent a new and unique communication system for the FCS Warfighter in the field.  The use of the ferroelectric phase shifters will reduce the size, weight and power consumptio n of phased array antennas.  Reliability is also expected to increase, although system reliability will still be limited by performance of MMIC power amplifiers.  (There are concurrent efforts to address this component.) 2.1 SCHEDULE:  This effort will start in FY 04 since the technology is mature enough to enter the ManTech program.  The first set of ferroelectric phase shifter device samples are required no later than six months from the start of the program.  Four addit ional sets of samples are required at 6-month intervals (total of five (5) sets).  This allows time for analyzing each batch and modifying the design and manufacturing processes to overcome problems.  Initial samples will be for the 18.5 to 21.2 GHz freque ncy range, followed by samples at 27.5 to 31 GHz and 43.5 to 45.5 GHz.  These frequency ranges are those required by PM WIN-T and FCS for use with Global Broadcast System, Wideband Gapfiller, MILSTAR and Advanced EHF satellites.  Packaging issues are addre ssed from the outset (and throughout the duration) of the program.  Advances in design and manufacturing processes must justifiably result in reduced loss, increased reliability and yield, and lower phase shifter cost.  Reliability testing will be conducte d on all samples.  Benchmark testing procedures will be developed to demonstrate and compare the performance of the actual ferroelectric components against predefined goals for performance, yield, reliability and operational lifetime.  Please note that dur ing the sample device testing sequence, devices will be randomly selected, enclosed in suitable packages, tested and analyzed. 2.2 PERFORMANCE:  Improved performance is an integral part of this program.  Note: Failure to meet the goals established in this SOW may lead to reduced funding for the ManTech program.  The following are the performance requirements which are required to be reported to US Army R&D Command on a quarterly basis:         FY05		   FY06	           FY07		       FY08 1Q  2Q  3Q  4Q    Q  2Q  3Q  4Q    1Q  2Q  3Q  4Q    1Q  2Q  3Q  4Q Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss	 9dB	        7dB	               6dB		           5dB Ã¢Â€Â¢	 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Yield	35%	        50%	               60%	           80% Ã¢Â€Â¢	 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Cost	 $50	        $30	               $15                      $10 2.3 Electrical Requirements: Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss			 Ã¢Â€Â“	18.5 - 21.2 GHz						3.0-5.0 dB max Ã¢Â€Â“	27.5 - 31.0GHz						3.5-5.5 dB max Ã¢Â€Â“	43.5 - 45.5 GHz						4.0-6.0 dB max Ã¢Â€Â¢	Return Loss								       15 dB min Ã¢Â€Â¢	Isolation								       15 dB min Ã¢Â€Â¢	Input/Output								50 ohm microstrip Ã¢Â€Â¢	Maximum Phase Shift						400 degrees min Ã¢Â€Â¢	Phase Variation over temp, voltage			Less than  11 degrees Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss variation over temp, voltage			Less than   3 dB Ã¢Â€Â¢	RF Power Handling Capability					100 mw Watt CW Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching Speed						Less than 300 nanosecond Ã¢Â€Â¢	Total Settling Time					Less than 1 microsecond Ã¢Â€Â¢	Activation Voltage					Less than 30 Volts Ã¢Â€Â¢	Power Consumption					Less than 4 mW Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching								Hot (RF applied) Ã¢Â€Â¢	Intermodulation Distortion						-22dBc Ã¢Â€Â¢	Size									0.8 x 1.7 mm max Ã¢Â€Â¢	Operational Lifetime					Less than 20 years 2.4 Test Methods (per MIL-STD 883E and MIL-PRF-38535J): Ã¢Â€Â¢	Screen Ã¢Â€Â“	Vi sual Inspection			M2010 Ã¢Â€Â“	Physical Dimensions			M2016 Ã¢Â€Â“	Stabilization Bake			M1008	Cond B, non-operating Ã¢Â€Â“	Thermal Shock				M1011.9	Cond B  -55oC to + 125oC Ã¢Â€Â“	Constant Acceleration			M2001.2	15,000G, Y1 axis only Ã¢Â€Â“	Serialization Ã¢Â€Â¢	Interim (Pre Burn-In) Electrical Parameters Ã¢Â€Â“	Loss vs voltage						-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â“	Phase Shift vs Voltage					-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Burn-In						M1015.9	Cond B Ã¢Â€Â¢	 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Interim (Post Burn-In) Electrical Parameters Ã¢Â€Â“	Loss vs voltage						-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â“	Phase Shift vs Voltage					-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Percent Defective Allowable					5%, all lots Ã‚Â·	Group A  Electrical Tests Ã‚Â·	Static								-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Input/Output Return Loss Ã¢Â€Â¢	Input/Output Impedance Ã¢Â€Â¢	Maximum Phase Shift Ã¢Â€Â¢	Activation Voltage 	Dynamic							-55oC, +25oC, +85oC Ã¢Â€Â¢	Loss vs Voltage Ã¢Â€Â¢	Phase Shift vs Voltage Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching Speed Ã¢Â€Â¢	Settling Time Ã¢Â€Â¢	Power Consumption Ã¢Â€Â¢	Power Handling Capability Ã¢Â€Â¢	Switching Speed Ã¢Â€Â¢	Intermodulation Distortion Ã‚Â·	Seal						M1014 Ã‚Â·	External Visual					M2009 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Group B Tests Ã¢Â€Â“	Resistance to Solvents		M2015 Ã¢Â€Â“	Bond Strength			M2011 Ã¢Â€Â“	Die Shear Strength			M2019 Ã¢Â€Â“	Solderability				M2003 Ã¢Â€Â¢	Group C Tests Ã¢Â€Â“	Life					M1016	TBD* Hours @ +TBDoC 									100 mw min RF power Ã¢Â€Â“	End-point electrical parameters *  Accelerated life test conditions will be proposed/developed by the offeror and approved by the Government to justify 20-year operational lifetime.

<DESC>THE ABOVE NOTICE IS MODIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACOA), Rockville, MD .

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reports that there were approximately 6 million children under the age of 18 living with at least one parent who was dependent on alcohol or drugs in 2001. In addition, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism estimates that one in four children live in families with  with alcohol abuse. Children in these families often live in environments that are stressful, high risk, chaotic, and frightening.  Frequently, they are neglected or abused and face economic hardship and social isolation as well.  They often have difficulty mastering social and emotional tasks needed for healthy development and are more vulnerable to costly mental health and medical problems.  
With the assistance of the nation’s leading experts in program development, assessment, and strategies for helping this population, the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACoA) developed the Children’s Program Kit for SAMHSA. NACoA will implement the new program and provide the expert training for the Children’s Program Kit.  NACoA is the only national organization that knows the material that needs to be covered, understands how to implement the program, and has the ability to provide the expert training for the Children’s Program Kit.NACoA’s trainers have years of teaching treatment centers and others to:

o	Understand the enormous negative impact that alcoholism and drug addiction have on the family, especially the children;
o	Teach the children to draw on their own inner resiliency to not only survive, but also to thrive;
o	Teach the children to understand alcohol and drug addiction, how it impacts them, and how they can find help for themselves;
o	Provide help, hope, and healing for the children; and,
o	Minimize the odds that the children will themselves develop mental health problems or become addicted.

To date, NACoA has developed various educational publications, videos, and materials focusing on children of substance abusing parents for families, therapists, educators, physicians, nurses, and clergy.  

Historically, NACoA has provided the largest and most comprehensive regional and national training conferences on children of addicted parents and reached over 20,000 professionals over ten years.  NACoA experts are among the leading researchers, clinicians, and program directors working with or on behalf of children of alcohol or drug dependent parents. Its speakers and trainers have the experience and expertise to train treatment program personnel and community based prevention practitioners to implement a children’s program and facilitate these educational programs.

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) operates 275 military supermarkets (commissaries) worldwide.  The Agency is contemplating the replacement of the current Point of Sale (POS) systems at all commissaries.  One potential alternative for this replacement program is to procure the POS capability as a service in a manner similar to current "seat management" intiatives.  In this case, we may consider outsourcing our POS systems to a private contractor who would own all the hardware/software.  DeCA would then lease these as part of the service.  This concept requires a contractor to replace the existing POS systems in all 275 stores (approximately 3,000 lanes).  The serice would include maintenance of the systems for a five to ten year period, training, system conversion, interfaces (middleware) to DeCA business systems, and a 24X7 help desk.  The service concept also includes the upgrade of all hardware and software at appropriate intervals with the latest technology as well as user training in order to maintain parity with the commercial grocery industry.  Additional information can be obtained from the "business page" link at http://www.commissaries.com/ to include current store locations, operating hours, and other relevant data.  Firms interested in participating in such an effort should submit the following:  (1) Description of the approach to providing this service; (2) Risks associated with this service concept; (3) Examples, if any, where this or a similar concept applied to a similar size service requirement has been implemented; (4) capability of the firm to install the hardware/software, provide hardware/software maintenance, training and a help desk on a world wide basis; (5) Rough Order of Magnitude cost and schedule for providing this service over a five and ten year period; (6) Key terms and conditions for any contract to procure this service; and (7) The capability of your firm to provide such a service world wide.  Submit electronic copies (one copy) to Diane Brendel, Contracting Officer, at brendeld@scott.disa.mil and one copy to Ted Matthews, DeCA, teddy.matthews@deca.mil not later than 1600 hours CST, 06 Feb 04. This submittal shall not exceed thirty (30) pages exclusive of the cover page and tables of contents and figures.  Submittals must be compatible with Microsoft Office 2000 or in portable document format (.pdf).

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now included within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Emergency Preparedness & Response (EPR) Directorate, hereinafter referred to as FEMA, requires technical services under the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 to identify the causes and solutions for unacceptable property, economic and social losses that are the effects of property damages from natural, man-made and technological hazards. These technical services must be performed under the supervision of a licensed architect or engineer. However, an interdisciplinary team is frequently required to address the engineering, architectural, economic, land management, planning, environmental and other issues associated with reducing the losses from all hazards. These services are to be delivered across the United States and its territories.  These services will be delivered under the direction of FEMA’s Mitigation Division. Both FEMA HQ and FEMA’s Regional Offices will monitor specific tasks. 

All firms interested in applying for work are required to submit documentation specified in this synopsis under paragraph 5, SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.  SFs 254 and 255,  submitted in response to this synopsis will be used for screening firms preliminary to inviting submission of additional information.  The North American Industrial Classification System Code is 541330.  The small business size standard is $4 million (not-to-exceed).  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  If a large business is selected for contract award, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  The Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not required with initial submittal, but will be required prior to contract award if a large business is selected for contract negotiations.  The government intends to negotiate a Performance-Based contract, based upon the tasks identified under the Project Information section of this synopsis.  Award of one contract is anticipated by June 2004 for a period of one (1) base year, plus four (4) 1-year options.  

PROJECT INFORMATION:  Services incidental to the A-E effort are considered critical.  The government requires a strong, dedicated, management team with knowledge and experience to meet or exceed performance-based expectations.  Although engineering and architectural services are essential enablers to the success of the project, success under this contract requires other expertise in such areas as community and mitigation planning, technical writing and editing, effective communication skills, and building effective partnerships at all levels of government and with the private sector.  Program management approaches must consider the current, disaster-driven, wide variation in needed resources as well as the regulatory framework and statutory authorities FEMA operates within.  Three major OBJECTIVES of this Technical Assistance and Research Contract are: (1) Provide State-of-the-Art Technical Assistance and Research Support:  Implement a Program Management Plan and Quality Assurance and Surveillance Plan that ensure that the highest quality technical services are provided.  (2) Achieve Effective Program Management:  Develop and provide a continually improving program management structure that that ensures that technical assistance and applied research activities called for under this contract are carried out in an effective, efficient and timely manner.  (3) Build and Maintain Mutually Beneficial Partnerships:  Foster mutually beneficial partnerships and improve the systems that support them to achieve a shared outcome by creating a sense of shared ownership between FEMA and its partners.  

Offerors shall be expected to provide expert engineering knowledge of the expected performance to the built environment from (1) Natural hazards that include floods, hurricanes and typhoons, earthquakes, and tsunamis; (2) Man-made hazards that include blast as well as chemical, biological and radiological weapons; and (3) Technological hazards, such as accidental chemical releases.

This expert knowledge is needed for field investigations, research, and engineering analysis for two separate types of tasks. Both tasks, as described below, will normally involve a formal written report, booklet or manual to FEMA. These written documents are widely distributed and must undergo a stringent quality control process for both the engineering and the technical editing.

The selected firm shall be required to execute two separate types of tasks of equal importance.  During the 5-year period of this contract, FEMA expects to procure between $12 million to $20 million in services. The annual funding for services is expected to vary based on funding availability, disaster activity, and the need for post-disaster investigations.   The two general types of tasks accomplished under this contract are:

Task 1: Problem-focused studies

Task 2: Post-disaster forensic engineering investigations. This contract will be awarded as a one-year contract with additional four option years that may be exercised on an annual basis 

Task 1: Problem-Focused Studies. This task will normally result in a report or publication as part of a continuing effort to reduce disaster losses. This type of task will normally involve a literature search, considerable research and the task is completed over a six-month or longer period. Publications are also produced that give specific advice to national audiences on natural hazard risks and how to design and plan to address these risks. The audience includes design professionals, building owners, public officials, the general public and others.  In the future, FEMA expects to continue to reach different audiences with technical information through both printed material and information available on its website.

Task 2: Post-Disaster Forensic Engineering Investigations. This task involves fielding a forensic engineering team of nationally recognized experts, local experts, FEMA personnel and State representatives to quickly identify the causes of disaster damages and recommend how these damages can be avoided in the future. These deployments are called Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) deployments and replace the previous Building Performance Assessment Teams (BPATs).  This task requires a high state of readiness that includes the capability to place a team in the field with 48 hours following the declaration of a disaster by the President. In the post-disaster investigation, the engineering, field visits and the reports must usually be completed within 6-8 months. Findings from these forensic engineering investigations normally include recommendations that are addressed to public officials, design professionals and others.  These publications frequently affect reconstruction after a major disaster and can influence public policy on a national level. These reports are widely distributed and are subject to intense scrutiny. This task also includes annual funding for maintaining a database of national experts (MAT database), updating the FEMA MAT website, and otherwise maintaining readiness for MAT deployments.

SELECTION CRITERIA:  All submissions and information received from firms during the procurement process will be evaluated against the numbered evaluation factors below.  The procurement process will consist of two phases: (1) a screening phase during which SFs 254 and 255, will be used to select at least three (3) of the most highly qualified firms for continued participation in the procurement process; and (2) a selection phase during which slated firms (selected during the screening phase) will be invited to submit additional information and make oral presentations regarding their concept for furnishing the required services.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  
 
Solicitation Number: CDC115-03-019.  
 
This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 15 (08/25/03).  The proposed procurement will be conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Subpart 13.5. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 and the small business size standard in number of employees 1,000. This solicitation is being conducted under full and open competition, however all things being equal, preference will be given to U.S. small businesses. Please indicate your business status on your response. The following FAR and AIDAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 (Jul 2003); FAR 52.212-2 (Jan 1999) (see evaluation factors below); FAR 52.212-3 (Jun 2003); FAR 52.212-4 (Feb 2002); FAR 52.212-5 (Jun 2003), and AIDAR 752.7000. An offer should include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.  
 
PURPOSE:  CDC/CAR intends to procure a complete set of serology laboratory equipment, and associated start-up supplies.  Each laboratory will consist of the following: Automated Microplate Reader, Automated Microplate Washer, Incubator, Centrifuge for Serum Separation, Pipettors and appropriate consumables.  35 sets of equipment will be provided to national and district-level laboratories in Central Asia. The provision of this laboratory equipment is part of a larger program aimed at strengthening the disease surveillance capacity of the Central Asian countries. Other components of the overall initiative include laboratory training and quality control system development.  The equipment will be used to test serum samples for viral agents such as, at a minimum, HIV, and Hepatitis B and C. Individual laboratories will likely eventually use the equipment for other applications, but they are not within the scope of the current program and hence should not be a factor in equipment selection.  The equipment is to be located in laboratory spaces which will be specified and provided by the Ministries of Health in each of the Central Asian Republics, at the national or district level. The list of equipment for each of the 35 labs, with minimum required technical specifications will be provided upon request.  
 
Offers shall provide:
1. Unit price based on quantity for 35 laboratories;
2. Brand and model names and technical descriptions; Manufacturer part or catalog number;
3. Full text of warranty, including explicit statement of applicability in Central Asia Republics; name, address, telephone and e-mail contact of warranty-service provider in Central Asia Republics.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. FERC04C40196 is issued as a request for proposal and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC 01-19. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number 541.
Statement of Work: I. OBJECTIVE. Since 1952, LNG has been transported by ship without a major release of cargo or a major accident involving an LNG ship.  Recently, there has been an emergence of studies attempting to analyze the possibility of an LNG spill from a ship and to define the “worst case” scenario that would result from a deliberate, terrorist attack on an LNG vessel.  The FERC is seeking a highly qualified contractor to perform the services described in Section II and submit to the FERC staff a detailed study identifying specific model(s)/method(s) that can be used to calculate flammable vapor and thermal radiation hazards resulting from potential LNG vessel cargo releases during transit and while at berth.  The selected model(s)/method(s) must allow the analysis of these hazards at various sites.  The contractor shall prepare and submit to the FERC a detailed report recommending a model(s) and documenting the results of the analysis, as well as an assessment of computational theory and modeling methodology.  The detailed study shall include the rationale used in recommending the selected model(s).II. SCOPE OF WORK. The contractor shall evaluate the flammable vapor and thermal radiation hazards created by unconfined LNG spills on water resulting from an LNG cargo release. The study shall review international LNG experience (including Europe and Pacific Rim countries) with respect to experimental data on LNG spills, modeling methodology and hazard management.  The study is to be composed of a literature search, model evaluation, parameter analysis, and development of a model(s).   The tasks to be performed include:An evaluation of published models to calculate the rate of cargo release and the spread of unconfined LNG spills on water;•A determination of the effect of cargo tank hole diameter on cargo release and pool spread (including establishment of an upper limit);•An evaluation of these models to calculate the rate of vapor generation for unconfined LNG spills on water;An evaluation of the models to calculate thermal radiation distances from unconfined LNG spills on water;	An evaluation of the models to calculate the distance traveled by flammable vapors from unconfined LNG spills on water;	An evaluation of the theoretical basis for current models used to calculate each of the above, and a review of the applicability of existing computer modeling to field test data;A review of the effects of thermal radiation levels on population and structures;	A recommendation, including the selection rationale, of specific methods and a model which FERC staff may use to calculate the flammable vapor and thermal radiation hazards associated with marine transportation of LNG; and A comprehensive review of design, operational, safety, and security features and possible mitigating measures that an LNG facility and/or vessel operator employs or could provide to minimize impacts from: accidents; attacks; leaks; spills; fire; rapid phase transitions; or the spread of negatively buoyant, flammable vapor clouds.III. DELIVERABLES. Based upon the analyses, the contractor shall submit a comprehensive report to the FERC staff detailing the items in Section II and setting forth technical evaluations, recommendations, and conclusions regarding the modeling of impacts from flammable vapors and thermal radiation.  All requested topics shall be discussed in the report, which shall be considered confidential until released by the FERC.  The contractor shall also complete and provide to the FERC staff an electronic copy of the report in Microsoft Word 2002 format.  Deliverables shall include a contract kick-off meeting, a draft report, a briefing of FERC staff on the draft report, and a final report.  Throughout the study period, the contractor shall provide immediate notification to FERC staff of significant findings and important revelations.  The contractor will also be responsible for conducting weekly briefings with the FERC staff regarding the progress of the analysis.  Finally, the contractor will be available as an expert witness on behalf of the staff of the FERC in any hearings or meetings on applications.IV. SCHEDULE. The contractor shall submit a schedule of deliverables including intermediate milestone dates.  The draft report shall be submitted to the FERC staff no later than March 15, 2004.  The report will be finalized with responses to FERC staff comments by March 31, 2004.  All offerors and subcontractors will complete and submit with their proposals, either the Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) representation or the OCI disclosure (not both). Complete and submit the OCI Questionnaire. Request OCI information from A. Sakallaris. See DOE clauses 952.209-8 OCI-Disclosure and 952.209-72 OCI. Same/similar language will be incorporated into the resultant contract. Period of Performance:  From approximately February 9, 2004 to March 31, 2004.

As used in this clause   (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern.

(2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS +4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.

Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c) The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete.

This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for Ship / Contractor pre-performance conferences and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Offerors’ geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.
