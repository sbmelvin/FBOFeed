<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area Office intends to issue a sole source contract with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.  The purpose of this contract is to provide funding to Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG), as the lead implementing agency, to develop standardized methods for estimating angler exploitation and reward-response curves for a variety of species and fisheries across a broad geographical and sociological range in Idaho. Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG), Oregon Department Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), Idaho Power Company (IPC) proposes to pay for 73% of the proposed work involved.  IDFG is the state agency which has the responsibility to enforce regulations and manage fish and wildlife populations in the state of Idaho.  There is no other state agency or private company that possesses the same legal authority for fish and wildlife management in the state of Idaho. Within the general public there is no commercial use of the method or information gain utilized in this study. This information will be used solely to manage fish populations.  In addition, all capture and handing of fishes in the State of Idaho requires compliance with State of Idaho law.  The Department employs staff members who are trained and federally permitted for the capture and handling of ESA protected species and are trained and permitted for capture and handling of recreational fish species in the State of Idaho.  Parties who believe they have knowledge sufficient  to respond may e-mail their firm's qualifications to the following address:  mday@pn.usbr.gov   No phone or fax inquiries will be allowed.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration’s Office of Research and Development conducts a variety of research programs for improving rail transportation efficiency and safety.  Frequently, these programs are derived from short-term reactive conditions requiring the research to be performed as expeditiously as possible.  FRA’s intent is to award a Multiple Schedule IDIQ contract to 2 or more vendors in fulfilling these stated requirements.   This proposed acquisition is intended as a mechanism for providing timely responses in such instances, as well as to provide a mechanism for the support of programmed research.  As discrete research requirements are defined, individual task orders will be established under this contract to address specific research needs.  General topic areas which may be included in a task are: Railroad Vehicles; Non-electric Motive Power and Components: Hazardous Materials Transportation by Railroad; Railroad Operating Practices; Human Factors; Railroad Track, Structures and Components; Track-Train Interaction; Passenger and Freight Operations; Advanced Rail Systems Technology, including Positive Train Control; Railroad Signal, Communication, Control and Electric Traction Power.  Individual task orders may involve one or more of the above areas.  In the past, Human Factors Engineering has represented at least 20% of the overall effort of the contract.  It is estimated that roughly 36,000 labor hours of effort at an estimated cost of $5,000,000 will be required over the 3-year period of the contract term.  The RFP will also contain 2 optional years requiring roughly 10,000 labor hours per year.  The solicitation will be issued electronically using Fed Biz Ops on February 21, 2006.  No written copies will be available.

<DESC>Accelerated Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals (AMP) BAA06-31, Proposals Due 1600 ET, June 21, 2006, POC: Michael Callahan, M.D., DTM&H, DARPA/DSO; Phone: (571) 218-4596.
DESCRIPTION
The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking proposals for new technologies that radically accelerate the manufacturing of protein vaccines and protein-based therapeutics. This program is a key component of an overall DARPA focus to accelerate the insertion of critical therapeutics essential for the military.
The vision of the Accelerated Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals (AMP) program is to create an extremely rapid, flexible and cost-effective manufacturing system capable of producing three million doses of GMP-quality vaccines or monoclonal antibodies (mAB) within 12 weeks. This revolutionary manufacturing platform will have extraordinary flexibility, allowing for the manufacture of vaccines to protect against a wide range of viral, protozoan, fungal, bacterial and toxin antigens. The monoclonal antibodies produced by the platform will have the same efficacy and solubility profile as current FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies. Strong preference will be given to platforms that are capable of producing both small monomeric proteins (vaccine-like) and monoclonal antibodies.    
All proposers to this BAA must provide evidence of a highly integrated, multi-disciplinary team capable of fulfilling the entire vision, meeting all program objectives and milestones for each phase of the program. 
An accompanying Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) has been developed to aid in the preparation of proposals (www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/AMPPIP.pdf). Successful proposals will address the program goals and specifications outlined in this BAA and the associated PIP.
At the conclusion of this program, the proposer will deliver a high capacity, rapid vaccine and monoclonal antibody manufacturing system ready for transition to a commercialization partner and capable of producing protein therapeutics that are eligible for FDA approval.  
AMP is a three phase, 42-month program with a goal of revolutionizing protein therapeutics and vaccine manufacture. Unlike previous DARPA programs, the focus of AMP is not to develop new therapeutics or vaccines, but rather to develop new technologies to speed the manufacture of protein based drugs and vaccines to meet the needs of the Warfighter. Each phase requires logarithmic increases in the number of doses of vaccine and/or monoclonal antibody produced in the candidate system. 
The AMP program will consider a wide range of novel and non-traditional protein manufacturing platforms provided that they are capable of producing high quality monoclonal antibody and vaccines within the radically-shortened timelines. A key consideration is that protein production must be extremely flexible as the system will need to produce a wide range of proteins after being given the proper DNA construct. All platform systems will need to demonstrate production of a minimum of three proteins, one picked by the proposer and two test cases, where the target protein is selected by DARPA. These tests, known as 'Live Fire Tests,' provide an objective measure of performance. Manufactured proteins may be either a small vaccine antigen or a monoclonal antibody; however, DARPA WILL GIVE PERFERENCE TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE WIDEST RANGE OF SIMPLE, COMPLEX AND DIMERIZED PROTEINS. 

PROGRAM PHASES
The Accelerated Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals (AMP) program goal of 3 million doses of vaccine or protein therapeutic in 12 weeks is an extremely aggressive effort. This will be conducted in three phases of 12, 15 and 15 months, respectively. A successful proposal will thoroughly cover all details for meeting the milestones set forth for Phase I and Phase II as well as a discussion of the path to accomplish the milestones in Phase III. At the end of each phase, the team’s performance will be evaluated based on its achievement of the Phase’s milestones. 

Based on the results of each Phase and the availability of funding, a down-select is possible. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ANY PHASE DOES NOT GUARANTEE SELECTION IN THE NEXT PHASE. Performers that are selected to continue to Phase III will deliver 3 million doses of a protein therapeutic within 12 weeks in a second DARPA Live Fire Test with additional metrics of increased speed and reduced cost.

Specific program milestones for each of the three Phases are detailed in the accompanying Proposer Information Pamphlet:

In Phase I (12 months), the proposer must demonstrate that the synthesized protein has proper structure and functionality as demonstrated by routine biophysical and biochemical assays such as chromatography and mass spectrometry. Phase I requires that the performer outline a plan to demonstrate protein purity and proper protein folding. As part of the Phase I milestones, the proposer must also demonstrate a clear plan as to how they will achieve the milestones in Phase III, including cost estimates for protein production during manufacture at larger scale.  

In Phase II (15months), the required rate of protein production increases 10-fold and should be demonstrated in standard 30L fermenters or equivalent using alternate protein manufacturing platforms (see Special Case below), over a period of 12 weeks. Requirements for proper structure of the manufactured protein also become more stringent. Phase II includes the first of two DARPA Challenges known as Live Fire Tests in which the proposer has 3-months to manufacture a vaccine or monoclonal antibody against a DARPA-selected target. The Live Fire Test provides an objective measure of the proposer’s technical capability.

Phase III (15 months) will achieve the overall goal of producing 3 million doses of a protein therapeutic within 12 weeks in a second DARPA Live Fire Test. Phase 3 will also require an additional 10-fold increase in the speed of manufacturing compared to Phase II. In Phase III, the estimated costs of manufacture should be less than $1/dose for a vaccine and less than $10/dose for a mAB.   

Special Case: Non-fermentative and Alternative Protein Manufacture

Proposers that present alternative protein manufacture such as plant-based, algal, arthropod, transgenic and other non-fermentative based protein manufacturing systems must indicate a metric for assessing equivalent measures to the yield of doses/(liters*week). For example, a proposal based on plant-based monoclonal antibody production, which might be measured in doses per acre, must provide and defend their rate metric for each of the three Phases. 

TEAM ORGANIZATION
The aggressive goals of the Accelerated Manufacturing Program require that each proposal include a multi-disciplinary team with demonstrated (or established) capability. The composition of the team might include large pharmaceutical companies, small biotechnology companies, agricultural genetic engineering groups,  academic research laboratories, pharmaceutical consultant groups, enzyme and alcohol manufacturers and privately funded research programs. Proposals that center solely on one research sub-component, while neglecting the overall vision and required end capability, will not be considered for funding. At a minimum, teams are expected to possess expertise or demonstrate collaboration with members in the following areas:

a)	Molecular Biology- with expertise in protein cloning, purification processes and optimization of growth conditions.
b)	Protein Chemistry- with expertise in structure of proteins and post-translational modification (e.g. amidation and glycosylation)
c)	Manufacturing- expertise in large scale production of proteins. 
d)	Expertise in FDA certified Good Manufacturing Processes (c GMP) regulations

Strong, competent team leadership is essential for successful implementation of the elements of this program.  For this reason, it is critical that the research team be organized around an integration partner or Systems Integrator (SI) who has the responsibility of overall program management and who will maintain a focus on the AMP objectives.   

DARPA will evaluate proposals based on the composite expertise and experience of the teams, their understanding of the challenges, current data, access to facilities to conduct the proposed work, and most importantly, a clear plan to achieve the specific milestones of the program. It is left to the discretion of the proposer to construct their team from the private, academic and commercial parties that will be necessary to carry out the effort.  
 
Since team composition will ultimately determine the success of this program, a teaming website will be set up to facilitate these interactions (http://www.sainc.com/ampteaming/) 

EVALUATION AND FUNDING INFORMATION
Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive.  For evaluation purposes, a proposal is the document described in Proposal Format.  Other supporting or background materials submitted with the proposal will be considered for the reviewer's convenience only and not considered as part of the proposal.  DARPA reserves the right to request an oral presentation of proposals.  If such a request is made, it is expected that, to the extent possible, all key personnel on the team will be present.  The request for an oral presentation, or lack thereof, should not be construed as either a positive or negative assessment of the proposal.
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with proposers; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options. 
The following evaluation criteria are listed in order of decreasing importance. Proposals that are deemed unsatisfactory in Scientific and Technical merit will not be evaluated further. 
Scientific and Technical Merit
Proposals will be evaluated as follows: Proposers must demonstrate that their proposal is innovative and unique, that the technical approach is sound, that they have an understanding of critical technical issues and risk and that they have a plan for mitigation of those risks. A significant improvement in capability or understanding above the state of the art in the manufacture of biological pharmaceuticals must be demonstrated. A key consideration is that protein production be extremely flexible as the system will need to produce a wide range of proteins after being given the proper DNA construct. A critical part of the evaluation is to provide details describing a clear pathway to a Phase III transition including plans for transition to a commercialization partner capable of producing protein therapeutics that are eligible for FDA approval. All milestones must be clearly and quantitatively described. Proposers are encouraged to avoid obscure language and indeterminate measures of success as these will not help the application. 
Value to Defense
Proposals will be evaluated as follows: Proposers must demonstrate the AMP vision to create technologies that will enable the Department of Defense to have a rapid (within weeks) and highly effective medical therapeutic response to any intentional or naturally emergent pathogen. 
Capability of the Personnel and Facilities to Perform the Proposed Effort
Proposals will be evaluated as follows: Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project. Interdisciplinary teams should include expertise or demonstrated collaboration in molecular biology, protein chemistry, and manufacturing expertise in FDA certified cGMP regulation. The Systems Integrator (SI) is responsible for ensuring that the team meets all milestones and metrics and integration of all proposed research. Facilities should be detailed with discussion of any unique capabilities pertinent to the research. Expertise can be acquired from many sources including consultant groups with an active stake in the program.  
Cost Realism
The objective of this criterion is to assure that proposed cost is consistent with proposed effort. The proposed cost will be evaluated as follows: 
Costs are justified in relation to the scope of the proposed program. Other funding sources and activities are taken into account. A budget for an optional second and third phase is provided and includes justification of all costs.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
The accompanying Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) contains necessary details regarding program planning and objectives as well as guidelines for white paper and proposal preparation, submission and evaluation that are not contained in this BAA (http://www.sainc.com/dso0631/). Other supporting or background materials submitted with the white paper or full proposal will be considered for the reviewer’s convenience only and not considered as part of the white paper or proposal. White papers and proposals received by fax will not be accepted.
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA. Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for SDB, HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.
WHITE PAPERS
DARPA encourages the submission of White Papers to allow for comments to the proposer. White papers should be concise and limited to 8 pages in length. The white paper shall consist of: executive summary, scientific and technical challenges, methods to meet milestones, and cost estimations. Details regarding the white paper are included in the PIP.
The white paper should demonstrate that the proposer has a clear understanding of current protein manufacturing systems, including shortcomings in current capability. Milestones must be associated with demonstrable metrics of performance for Phase I and Phase II as well as a clear pathway to advance to Phase III. 
White papers may be submitted and received at any time until the white paper deadline. 
WHITE PAPERS ARE DUE TO THE ADDRESS SHOWN BELOW NO LATER THAN 1600 ET, May 17, 2006.
Within two weeks of receipt of the white paper, the proposer will receive a confirmation providing a log number. The formal recommendation about whether a full proposal is recommended will be made as soon as possible. However, the exact time for response will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the number of white papers received. Please note: Feedback provided is for the benefit of the proposer and following these recommendations is not a guarantee that the full proposal will be funded. 
FULL PROPOSALS
The PIP outlines necessary details for proposal submission. Proposals shall consist of two volumes: Technical and Cost. Specific attention should be paid to technical expertise of the System Integrator and other key research members, and a management plan for multi-organizational teams. 
Proposals may be submitted and received at any time until the full proposal deadline. 
PROPOSALS ARE DUE TO THE ADDRESS SHOWN BELOW NO LATER THAN 1600 ET, June 21, 2006.
PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

All proprietary information should be clearly marked on the white paper and full proposal. It is the policy of DARPA to treat all white papers and full proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a nondisclosure agreement with DARPA, unless the specific phrase TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY appears on the cover sheet. In any case, personnel under exclusive contract with DARPA who have completed the appropriate nondisclosure agreements will handle the proposals for administrative purposes. 

GUIDANCE FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND DATA

The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under a BAA will be unclassified. 

In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal, the following information is applicable.

Proposals may contain classified information or data (up to the level of Top Secret/SCI). HOWEVER, DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED FULL PROPOSALS BY EMAIL OR VIA ONLINE SUBMISSION SYSTEMS. 

Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their proposals should contact DARPA security at (571) 218-4842 (or alternatively, the point-of-contact for this BAA) for security guidance and direction in advance of proposal preparation. Proposers must have existing approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose. 

Security Classification guidance on DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award. 

Proposers choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in applying to this BAA. An applicable classification guide should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately. 

For instructions on submitting Classified Full Proposals, contact Security & Intelligence Directorate (SID) Classification Management at (571) 218-4842.

RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN USE
Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the DoD Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects. This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.  
For proposals involving ‘greater than minimal risk’ to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve ‘greater than minimal risk’ after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable Federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/). 
PATENT INFORMATION
Please include documentation proving your ownership of or possession of appropriate licensing rights to all patented inventions (or inventions for which a patent application has been filed) that will be utilized under your proposal for the DARPA program.  If a patent application has been filed for an invention that your proposal utilizes, but the application has not yet been made publicly available and contains proprietary information, you may provide only the patent number, inventor name(s), assignee names (if any), filing date, filing date of any related provisional application, and a summary of the patent title, together with either: 1) a representation that you own the invention, or 2) proof of possession of appropriate licensing rights in the invention. Please also provide a good faith representation that you either own or possess appropriate licensing rights to all other intellectual property that will be utilized under your proposal for the DARPA program.

<DESC>Sole-source Award of Environmental Monitoring, Analysis, Service, and Consultation (EMASC) Project for the Library of Congress

Contracting Office Address:
Library of Congress
Office of Contracts and Grants Management
101 Independence Ave SE LA-325, Washington, DC 20540-9411

Description:
The Preservation Directorate of the Library of Congress intends to award a sole source Contract to the Image Permanence Institute that will permit the Library to enhance its ability to preserve collection materials, in accordance with the attached Statement of Work for Environmental Monitoring and Analysis. Service, and Consultation dated 06 March 2006.
Environmental conditions, particulates, and air pollutants are major factors affecting the deterioration rate of collections. It is critical for the Library’s Preservation Directorate to monitor and interpret the storage conditions for important collections, and to use that information in strategic planning for facilities and preservation resources. Specifically, the Library needs an efficient way to gather temperature and relative humidity data, to produce analyses of the quality of storage conditions based on the nature and vulnerabilities of collection materials, and to communicate this information to the office of the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), Library Facilities Office (ISS/FACS), and to the curatorial division staff that have responsibility for those collections. 

The Directorate must also establish an overview of each storage area’s mechanical systems in order to know whether the actual conditions could be improved with existing equipment, whether particulate filtration or gas-phase pollutant filtration are present, as well as an overview of what other areas and collections would be affected if changes were made to specific location setpoints for temperature and relative humidity. The development of profiles for each collection storage location will provide a valuable planning resource for many years.

As a result of the foregoing needs, the Library of Congress requires consulting services, equipment and software to monitor, document, and plan for environmental improvements in approximately 30 platinum, gold and silver level collections storage areas. The project will expand upon the comprehensive infrastructure of equipment, procedures, and trained personnel built over the past five years, to gather, analyze, and communicate environmental data. The project will develop profiles of not-yet-analyzed collection storage areas, which will be useful in strategic planning for future environmental upgrades. These profiles will include information on collections, quality of environment for preservation, capabilities of mechanical systems currently in buildings, capacity of current systems to control particulates or gas-phase pollutants, and priorities for improvement of environments in collection storage areas.

It is the Library’s belief that the only contractor presently qualified to make suggestions for new or upgraded mechanical systems to serve SSFs (Secure Storage Facilities), the Rare Books and Special Collection stacks, and off-site storage facilities such as Fort Meade, Landover, MD, and the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center (NAVCC) in Culpeper, VA based on the existing approval of the Architect of the Capitol and its historical knowledge of the existing systems and facilities is the Image Permanence Institute. However, any other company that (1) is either legally incorporated as a U.S. business entity, or is capable of demonstrating through its business plan its intention to be fully incorporated as a U.S. business; and (2) believes it can meet the performance requirements of the attached Statement of Work can apply to the Library for consideration. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a modification to contract N61331-04-C-0006 with Advanced Acoustic Concepts, Inc. (AAC).   Under contract N61331-04-C-0006, AAC is developing an Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) contact recognition training system using the same technology developed for the Surface Navy Integrated Undersea Tactical Technology (SNIUTT) project.  This effort builds directly on technologies, algorithms, and software developed by AAC in developing highly sophisticated embedded anti-submarine warfare sonar training systems under the SNIUTT project. AAC was the originator of and developed the initial concept of SNIUTT. This modification provides for continued development of an AMCM Scenario Generator (ASG) and continued updates to current AMCM contact recognition training, as well as implementing development of a Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) contact recognition trainer for the AN/SQQ-32 sonar and related train!  ing materials for the AN/SQQ-32 again based on the SNIUTT technologies. Funding for this project was a Congressional add for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Appropriations Act and the language in the legislation specifically designates the funding for the SNIUTT project. As the originator of the SNIUTT concept and the developer of the initial trainers under the project, AAC is the only source with the prerequisite experience, knowledge, and expertise required to successfully perform this requirement.  Point of contact for this action is Robert  Kuczenski, phone (850) 234-4864; fax, (850) 234-4251; e-mail, robert.kuczenski@navy.mil

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for 1 each Newton USB camera head, 1 each Luca EMCCD camera, 1 each Software Developer Kit, and shipping charges. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Andor Technology.  The electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD) technology from Andor Technology permits the use of on-chip electron-gain without an image intensifier, permitting enhanced quantum efficiency (QE) (&gt;90%), high image resolution, high dynamic range, low-noise, and immunity from damage due to inadvertent exposure to bright light sources.  The use of EMCCD technology is critical to the implementation of a state-of-the-art single-shot spontaneous Raman scattering system for performing combustion code validation experiments at GRC.  For pulsed single-shot Raman scattering, the signals are extremely faint, necessitating the use of the EMCCD feature.  Both cameras will be used simultaneously: line item 1 for point Raman, and line item 2 for 1-d line-imaging Raman in real-time. The Andor EMCCD cameras in this order provide the following combination of benefits not found anywhere else: 1. EMCCD sensor technology with back-illuminated sensors for high QE, and 25 mm wide with 1600 pixels in the x-axis for the best combination of spectral resolution and dynamic range.	Also, the detector needs to have the same or better spectral response curve from 200 nm to 1000 nm; 2. Software selectable EM gain of 1-1000x; 3. readout noise &lt; 1 electron/pixel with EM gain on; 4. 1600x400 pixel sensor with 16 micron pixels for line item 1, 640x480  pixel resolution with 10 micron pixels for line item 2; 5. max spectral rate of 299 scans/sec with line item 1, 30 fps full image with line item 2; 6. 16 bit digitization of signal; 7. USB 2.0 connectivity with no external controller box required; 8. Deep cooling (Newton) using simple thermo-electric coolers down to -100 C to minimize dark counts. The sole source is under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in FAR Part 13. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 4/7/2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

In addition, the AO shall administer the consensus process for the development and interpretation of the Federal standards, and the procedural and enforcement regulations.  The AO, upon request of the consensus committee, shall provide reasonable staff resources to the consensus committee; and furnish technical support in a timely manner to any of the interest categories described in the legislation.  The period of performance will not exceed 66 months, including the Base Period and all Option Periods, if exercised.  Only those proposal received from companies explicitly meeting the definition of an AO shall be considered.  The RFP release date will be on or about April 13, 2006.  It is anticipated that a Cost Plus Fixed Fee award will be made on or about June 15, 2006, based on the best value to the Government.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award an IDIQ, commercial type contract on a non-competitive, sole-source basis to Trek Diagnostic Systems for the delivery of Sensititre equipment and lab supplies for the period of one Base Year and four Option Years. This is a follow-on to Contract No. 223-03-7501 with Trek Diagnostics. The FDA intends to purchase the following MIC plates, lab supplies, and equipment during the Base Year:  Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Plates for E. coli and Salmonella, 10 per box, 1,600 boxes; MIC Plates for Enterococcus, 10 per box, 500 boxes; MIC Plates for Campylobacter, 10 per box, 425 boxes; Custom MIC plates for research, 10 per box, 100 boxes;  MIC single antibiotic test strips for research, 8 per box,  400 boxes; Mueller Hinton broth with TES, 11 ml tubes, 100 per box, 210 boxes; demineralized water, 6 mL tubes, 100 per box, 210 boxes; Doseheads for use with Autoinoculator, 100 per box, 253 boxes;  Mueller Hinton broth with TES, 5 ml tubes, 100 per box, 43 boxes; Mueller Hinton Broth with TES and lysed horse blood, 11 mL tubes, 10 per box, 425 boxes; 0.5 polymer McFarland standard, 14 each; autoinoculator, one each; Sensitouch Reader, one each; ARIS System, one each; and Computer System with  Sensititre Windows software, one each.

The National Antimicrobial resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is an interagency surveillance program involving FDA, CDC, and USDA.  Sensititre equipment was installed in all NARMS laboratories at the inception of the program in 1996 to assure methodological consistency.  Sensititre specializes in antimicrobial susceptibility testing of veterinary drugs but also supplies products for determination of MICs for drugs that are used to treat human infections.  The use of a single test system in all NARMS laboratories ensures consistent testing of isolates and enhances comparability of the resulting data.  Varying test systems could impart bias into the susceptibility results and thereby preclude trends analysis of MIC data, an integral part of the NARMS program.  This would severely limit the Government’s ability to detect and respond to emerging resistance problems and outbreaks of resistant zoonotic enteric disease.  For these reasons, the Sensititre system currently established in NARMS laboratories must continue to be used.  The disposable supplies will be used by the Government with its Sensititre equipment which requires ancillary supplies specific to the equipment.  Sensititre products are solely distributed in the US by Trek Diagnostic Systems of Cleveland, Ohio.  The Sensititre AST (Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test) system is found in human and animal hospital and private diagnostic laboratories across the country and internationally because it provides consistent and reliable data and is simple and easy to use.  This is not a formal request for quotes.  However, the evaluation of other offers and any award decision will be made on a best value basis.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Paulette Wilson, (757) 878-2788
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of a noncommercial program entitled, Advanced Helicopter Universal Controls (AHUCS). The Army's overarching requirement is to develop and qualify an advanced engine control that dem onstrates commonality across all Army aviation engines simplifying logistical support for such controls.  The acquisition builds upon previously completed contracted research and development as well as independent research and development conducted by Good rich Pump and Engine Control Systems, Inc.  AATD anticipates award of an  Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to Goodrich Pump and Engine Control Systems, Inc., who is deemed to be the only responsible source uniq uely capable of meeting this requirement.  The maximum value of the contract will be $9.5 million.  The contract minimum value of $700,000 will be met with award of the first task order issued as a cost-plus-fixed-fee order.  The funding for this requireme nt is Congressionally directed for research, development, qualification testing, and flight testing of engine Universal Control technology.  Accordingly, this acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l), as implemented by  FAR 6.3 02-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as market research has identified only Goodrich Pump and Engine Control Systems, Inc as the only source developing Universal Control technology which 1) Ha s application to multiple Army turboshaft  engines; 2) Exploits modern hybrid high power microprocessors; 3) Exploits partitioning;  4) Accomodates advanced software concepts such as model based controls and neural network diagnostics; and 5) Possesses  bo ard architecture which addresses commonality and obsolescence.  The Government deems that substantial duplication of cost incurred under the previously conducted research cannot be recovered through competition.  No other known source has the equivalent te chnical maturity to satisfy the Government requirement in the timeframe for which congressionally earmarked funds were provided.  Many of the concepts to be further explored under the planned efforts are either patented or proprietary to Goodrich Pump and Engine Control Systems, Inc.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Goodrich Pump and Engine Control Systems, Inc.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and  Goodrich Pump and Engine Control Systems, Inc, consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).   The overall period of performance for the IDIQ contract is sixty (60) months.  The applicable North  American Industrial Classification System (NIACS) code is 541710 and the size standard is 1,500.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be add ressed to AATD, Attn: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Paulette L. Wilson), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Ms. Wilson's phone number is 757-878-2788.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing  at the above address (Datafax 757-878-0008) or pwilson@aatd.eustis.army.mil.

<DESC>NOAA, Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) located at MacDill AFB, Florida operates two P-3 aircraft in the support of atmospheric research. Each aircraft measures and records a variety of atmospheric parameters including liquid water content (LWC), total water content (TWC) and ice water content (IWC). AOC currently uses two types of sensors for this measurement: a King model LWC-100 and a J&W model LWH. Both units measure water content using a heated wire technique. These sensors cannot withstand the heavy precipitation and icing encountered during hurricane research flights. A more accurate and robust design is needed to provide accurate liquid, ice and total water measurements. Two accepted methods for measuring LWC/TWC are available, optical (droplet size/counting) and hot-wire instruments. Optical sensors require an independent instrument comparison for absolute calibration, have an unknown response in mixed-phase situations (presence of water and ice), and tend to be larger instruments requiring special mounting considerations. Hot wire instruments provide a fundamental measurement not requiring an independent instrument comparison for calibration (although several error sources must be considered including: measurements of the probe sensor area, resistance of sensor wire at operating temperature, various empirical constants in the heat transfer equations, and collection efficiencies of the wire). Wire elements come in two types, wire wound and solid wire. Hot-wire instruments utilizing the wire wound method make use of a fine wire wrapped around a solid core as an integral part of the sensor design. Exposure of the sensor to heavy precipitation and icing during flight results in damage to the wire and sensor failure. Replacement wire elements are expensive and replacement is labor intensive. Solid wire sensors use a thicker gauge solid wire, nickel or stainless steel, to measure water content. This sensor design is less likely to be damaged by icing or heavy precipitation. The replacement instrument must be a constant-temperature, hot-wire probe designed for aircraft measurements of ice and liquid water content using stainless steel solid wire elements. It must be capable of withstanding the harsh environment encountered by aircraft during hurricane research missions and meet strict size, power and weight limitations. The instrument must be capable of measuring over a wide range of medium volume droplet (MVD) sizes to include super-cooled large droplets (SLD). Capabilities must include the detection and measurements of ice crystals over a wide range of altitudes and airspeeds.  The sensor will be mounted on the aircraft fuselage in place of LWC/TWC sensors currently in use, therefore must be similar in size, fit and form. Instrument must provide accurate liquid and total water content measurement from 0-10 gms/m3 at true airspeed up to 150 m/s over a flight level of 0 to 45,000 ft. To meet aircraft operational requirements the instrument must require little maintenance and have long term dependability.   Instrument should not require pre and/or post flight calibration or labor intensive operation. Serial output data must be in a usable form for real time display and collection and not require post processing. Data stream must include LWC, TWC and IWC measurement values.The Government may purchase up to four additional sensor systems within nine months of base award.  Delivery shall be in October 2006. The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12, Commercial Items and Part 15, Contracting By Negotiation. This acquisition is restricted to small business only.  Solicitation issue date is expected by end of April 2006 with contract award expected by end of July 2006.

<DESC>NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) located at MacDill AFB, Florida has a need to obtain off-the-shelf replacement cloud physics instruments with equivalent cloud physics probes and data acquisition software/hardware.

The shape of an ice particle influences its scattering properties, growth rate, and terminal fall velocity. The scattering properties of cloud ice particles may significantly affect the climate and radiation balance of the whole earth. Scattering properties of ice particles are also important for satellite retrievals and remote sensing. An ice particle’s shape affects its rate of growth through the processes of vapor deposition and riming. These mechanisms define the rate of precipitation growth, which is important for weather and forecasting models. The terminal fall velocity influences the lifetime of ice clouds which may, in turn, affect the radiation budget of the earth. Cloud physics probes were originally developed by Particle Measuring Systems (PMS Inc., Boulder, Co) for the measurement of cloud and precipitation drop size distributions. These sensors are used primarily for the study of cloud microphysical processes, particularly the growth of cloud drops and ice crystals through aggregation, riming and coalescence into drizzle, rain drops, or other forms of precipitation. In a typical PMS probe, a laser beam is projected onto a photo-detector array. As the particle traverses the sample area, its shadow obscures a selection on the photo-detector. The detector array produces image slices at a frequency proportional to the true air speed. This generates images with the same resolution along the flight direction and the direction of orientation of the photodiode array. In order to reliably use microphysics measurements in mixed phase clouds, the respective contributions of ice and water must be sorted out so that a particle size distribution (PSD) can be constructed for each phase. To sort out ice and water PSDs in mixed phase clouds, careful processing of the data combining contributions from other probes  require a dedicated effort on a case-by-case basis. Each type of probe responds to a different size range and their individual contributions need to be integrated in the analysis. Unfortunately, there is no prescribed formula for combining PSDs from various probes, and the problem is compounded in mixed phase clouds.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has conducted cloud physics experiments through the years. At AOC, where two P3 Orion aircraft are operated for weather research, cloud physics instrumentation is part of the standard aircraft scientific equipment. The cloud physics probes installed on the aircraft have suffered a lot of wear and tear through many years of use. Some minor upgrades, calibrations and repairs keep them operational. However, these probes are overdue for replacement. Better technology with today’s electronics will benefit scientific research if AOC acquires more capable cloud physics systems. 

The more capable cloud physics systems proposed by AOC should be composed of the following cloud physics instruments:
o Cloud Combination Probe (CCP). This probe combines a Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP) with a Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP).
o Precipitation Imaging Probe (PIP).
o Cloud and Aerosol Spectrometer (CAS).
o Cloud Aerosol and Precipitation Spectrometer (CAPS). This probe combines a Cloud and Aerosol Spectrometer (CAS) with a Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP).

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration’s Office of Research and Development conducts a variety of research programs for improving rail transportation efficiency and safety.  Frequently, these programs are derived from short-term reactive conditions requiring the research to be performed as expeditiously as possible.  FRA’s intent is to award a Multiple Schedule IDIQ contract to 2 or more vendors in fulfilling these stated requirements.   This proposed acquisition is intended as a mechanism for providing timely responses in such instances, as well as to provide a mechanism for the support of programmed research.  As discrete research requirements are defined, individual task orders will be established under this contract to address specific research needs.  General topic areas which may be included in a task are: Railroad Vehicles; Non-electric Motive Power and Components: Hazardous Materials Transportation by Railroad; Railroad Operating Practices; Human Factors; Railroad Track, Structures and Components; Track-Train Interaction; Passenger and Freight Operations; Advanced Rail Systems Technology, including Positive Train Control; Railroad Signal, Communication, Control and Electric Traction Power.  Individual task orders may involve one or more of the above areas.  In the past, Human Factors Engineering has represented at least 20% of the overall effort of the contract.  It is estimated that roughly 36,000 labor hours of effort at an estimated cost of $5,000,000 will be required over the 3-year period of the contract term.  The RFP will also contain 2 optional years requiring roughly 10,000 labor hours per year.  The solicitation will be issued electronically using Fed Biz Ops on February 21, 2006.  No written copies will be available.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is seeking proposals for modernization of the USDA Corporate Financial Management Systems through replacement of the current core financial management system.  This replacement acquisition is known as the USDA Financial Management Modernization Initiative (FMMI).

This acquisition will include: Program Management; Transition and Migration Support; Software Solution and Integrator Services; and Hosting Services of FMMI.  This acquisition is Unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541512 with a Small Business Size Standard of $23.0 million.  The award is anticipated to be performance-based, fixed-priced award and may contain time-and-material and/or labor-hour portions.  Award will be made to the offeror(s) that provides the overall Best Value to the Government through evaluation of their technical solution, corporate/government experience/past performance, sub-contracting/Small Business utilization and cost/price.  The Government reserves the right to make more than one award.  All evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Request for Proposals and any attachments will be available on or about 29 December 2005 at the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/).  The receipt date for proposals will be included in the RFP.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure access to the most current information available on this procurement.

<DESC>This modification is to answer more questions


Q1:  Would you mind being more specific about what is sought on the SOO doc, section 2.1, 3rd para, where you say: “If a tool or tools are used, the offeror shall provide information regarding the credentials of the tool(s).”

A1: What I would like the contractor to do is provide some information which lends credibility to the effectiveness of the tool(s) for our use case.  This is fairly open-ended, and could be a combination of technical specifications, projects that the tool has been used for, successes with the tool, or any other information which gives us a good idea of whether the tool is worth investing in.   For example, if the contractor plans to use a proprietary tool, and a search of open literature doesn’t provide any useful information on whether the tool is effective for our use case (or at all), then when we’re evaluating the proposal we have no idea if the tool is going to bring anything beneficial to the effort.  In contrast, if the contract submits a statement that external testing has verified their tool correctly identifies 95% of potential software vulnerabilities, then that is something useful when we’re evaluating the proposal.


Q2: Would the Air Force consider an alternative proposal for off-site reviews?

A2: That is not an option for this contract.  The code reviews must be held here.  It’s not a classification issue, more of a conops issue… we don’t let our source code go anywhere.

The advisor has authority to address problems and constraints in program areas.  The contract administrator shall be the INL contracting officer.

The COR is delegated the authority to act for the Contracting Officer in matters concerning technical clarification, inspection, and after concurrence by the Contracting Officer, acceptance of contractor performance under the contract, including acceptance of progress reports, when appropriate.  The COR will coordinate all work with the aviation advisor and review performance at regular intervals.

In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms or the conditions or waive the government's requirements, price delivery, or other terms and conditions.  The Contracting officer must authorize all contract changes in writing.

The advisor directly oversees the programs in his portfolio and advises host nation personnel.

Guidelines: guidance is provided from State Department and administration policy and directives and operating procedures regarding US international narcotics control matters.  Since these guidelines provide only broad guidance, originality, resourcefulness and ingenuity are required to interpret, adapt and apply them to complex program needs and situations.  With approval by supervisors incumbent may initiate new or modify procedures in accordance with the mission counter-narcotics program strategy and plan.

COMPLEXITY

Assignments involve organizations, operations and functions of significant complexity with interrelated programs of both the USG and the GOP in a complex international environment.

Scope and effectiveness: assignments or objectives sought will involve extensive analysis and investigation to detect and resolve problems and will affect several interrelated programs and impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of future international narcotics control operations and programs.

WORK ENVIRONMENT

The work is primarily conducted in an office.  The incumbent will travel to locations in the tropics or to mountainous, high altitude terrain, which involves significant physical exertion.  Some field sites have been declared hazardous duty locations due to hostile activities of the narco-traffickers and subversive elements and therefore pose significant risk to the incumbent while at these sites.

PERSONAL CONTACTS

The advisor is expected to maintain close working relationships with all levels of host nation contacts and with USG personnel of various agencies.

Purpose of contacts: the advisor serves as the NAS representative in his areas of subject matter expertise.  He/she provides advice and guidance on plans and proposals, investigates incidents and changes in program operations, and reports on meetings and program developments.  Contacts often require persuasion, diplomacy and cooperative relationships.

<DESC>This notice is hereby modified to add the following information:
The NIST Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) is currently working on autonomous on-road driving research. An infra-red camera is needed due to its capability to detect the heat signatures of people. This is important for pedestrian detection but can also be used to locate injured people in the urban search and rescue scenarios studied by other projects in ISD. These applications are mostly carried out outdoors, which puts constraints on the sensor to be selected.  NIST also requires the capability to be able to detect people indoors to provide warnings for the work performed in industrial autonomous vehicles. Thus, a FLIR camera is required for both indoor and outdoor applications.  The minimum specifications for the FLIR sensor are as follows:
Firewire output (IEEE 1394) with Linux driver and program (open source): this is very important for integrating with our real-time Linux system.
Sensor Size greater than or equal to 320 by 240 pixels.
Resolution greater than or equal to 16 bits per pixel.
Interchangeable lenses: Some applications require different lenses to accommodate different fields of view.
Frame Rate: 30-60 Hz.
Weight:  less than or equal to 3.5lb: Low weight is important because we will be mounting the sensor on small as well as large robots.
Spectral Range: at least 7.5-13 um: Important for indoor and outdoor applications.
The infrared camera shall be a microbolometer and shall not require cryogenic cooling.

All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
FA4890-05-RFI-0001
DEFINING THE COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT, AND IDENTIFYING COMMUNICATION NEEDS OF ACC AIRMEN AND SHADOW AUDIENCES

CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS
Department of the Air Force, Air Combat Command (ACC) - HQ ACC CONS, 130 Douglas Street, Suite 401, Langley AFB, A 23665

RESPONSE DATE:  08 April 2006, 5:00 PM EST

RESPOND TO:  Contracting office stated above Attn: Amber Weichbrodt.  See below for format and submission instructions.

ADDITIONAL GENERAL INFORMATION
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain information about pricing, delivery, and other market information or capabilities for planning purposes.  This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The NAICS code for this potential effort is 541910.

BACKGROUND
The Air Combat Command, Public Affairs (ACC/PA) is seeking to use focused research to define the communication environment and identify communication needs of its Airmen and “shadow audiences” (e.g. retirees and dependents).  Currently, unit-level Public Affairs offices within ACC spend a great deal of time and energy producing a weekly newspaper.  For 18 of the 20 units, this is their “#1 time-consuming product/event.”  Despite the great deal of manpower invested in producing the base newspaper, ACC/PA does not know what impact the paper has.  There is no statistical data to support the assertion that the newspaper is being read; the local newspaper readership surveys are neither scientific nor precise, and they do not draw from a random sample of a base population.  Along the same lines, the impact of other products the PA offices produce and maintain, like the Commander’s Access Channel and base guides, is also not known.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT
Given the advent of new technology such as podcasting, short messaging service (SMS), rich site summary (RSS) messaging, and the proliferation of older technology, such as the Internet, ACC/PA is interested in obtaining information from industry to determine, through focused research, if there is a better way of communicating key themes and messages with ACC’s Airmen and shadow audiences.  

Generally speaking, ACC/PA needs to answer two broad questions:
1) How do ACC’s Airmen and shadow audiences obtain news and information?
-	Do they get it from TV?  The Web?  The base newspaper? Their friends?  Their 1st Sgts?
-	In looking at this, it is important to not limit questions to, “How do Airmen get news about the Air Force.”  They may get their Air Force news from their 1st Sgts, but get other news at home when they go to ESPN.com or download their favorite podcast.
o	An effective study will dig down and find out how Airmen and shadow audiences learn about the world in which they live
2)	How do ACC’s Airmen WANT to get information about the Air Force?”  
-	Do Airmen and shadow audiences like base newspaper?  Would they prefer RSS, podcasts, etc.
-	And, is there a correlation between how they SAY they want to get their information and how they currently get their information.  
o	For example, if 90% of Airmen and shadow audiences say they want their news via SMS, but only 3% of them have SMS-enabled phones, we need to know that.

Responders must clearly describe their technical approach to conducting the research, including the methodology (e.g. focus groups, a scientific survey of a statistically significant representative population, etc.), provide a schedule estimate and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate of costs, as well as a brief company description and any other information deemed relevant (e.g. products and services, involvement in projects similar in scope to this RFI).  The Government may use the information provided by responders to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.  

All responders are requested to indicate their business status, i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, etc. 

FORMAT & PAGE LIMITATION
Submittals should be provided on standard letter size 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper, limited to a maximum of 18 single spaced pages.  The font for text should not be smaller than Microsoft Word Times New Roman 10 point font, normal proportional spacing.  The responder may use oversize pages (including “foldouts”) where appropriate to contain graphic presentations.  Oversize pages do not count as extra pages within the page limitations.  Existing commercial documentation and product literature can also be submitted and is not subject to page limitation.  

SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTATION
Information/documentation packages are due to the contracting office identified below by 5:00 pm Eastern Standard Time, 08 April 2006.  Responders shall provide one hard copy and one electronic copy (on CD-ROM in Microsoft Word or .pdf format) of their documentation.  All disks should be virus checked prior to submission, and clearly labeled with the responder’s name and contact information.  **If any information submitted is considered to be proprietary, then that specific information should be marked accordingly. 

Documentation shall be delivered to the Contract Manager at the following address:
HQ ACC CONS/LGCE
ATTN: Amber Weichbrodt
130 Douglas Street, Suite 403
Langley AFB, VA 23665-2791

<DESC>The purpose of this FedBizOpps announcement is to amend the original announcement by replacing the original attachment 2 (Percy Amendment Certification Form) with the attached attachment 2 (Certifications Relevant to Public Law 99-399).  In addition, attachment 4 (Q&A-1) is included.  The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO)  is seeking proposals to pre-qualify 8(a) firms for design-build projects at DOS Foreign Service posts worldwide.  Competition is restricted to eligible participants in the SBA’s 8(a) program.  The DOS anticipates award of up to four IDIQ contracts under which each firm will compete through a competitive proposal process for individual task orders.  The maximum of each task order is $7 million.  The maximum cumulative amount of the task orders issued under each contract in a single year is $20 million.  The IDIQ contracts will be issued for one base year and will include four one-year option periods that may be exercised by the Government.  Each contract will have a ceiling of $100 million for the base and all option years combined and a guaranteed minimum of $40,000 over the life of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make award of individual task orders estimated to be less than $3 million on a sole source basis to one of the contract awardees.  The award of individual task orders estimated to be greater than $3 million but less than or equal to $7 million will be competed between the firms chosen for award of the IDIQ contracts and selection will be based upon price and other factors stated in each request for task order proposal.  The competed task order awards will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror.  Although the IDIQ contracts will provide labor hour pricing for evaluation purposes, the task orders will be firm-fixed price.  The labor hour rates stated in the contract will be considered maximums.  At task order proposal time, offerors may propose a rate for a required labor category that is less than that listed in the contract, but the contract rates shall not be exceeded.  A specific period of performance will be established for each task order.  The scope of work (SOW) for task orders will include design-build construction services to provide new construction and/or renovation of existing buildings, facilities, structures, and building systems.  SOWs and specifications in task orders may also include site work and related structures to provide a complete, functional compound.  Task orders may include security improvements, new facilities, design/build construction, fire and life safety upgrades, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), to include chemical and biological filtration, energy conservation projects, electrical and mechanical system upgrades and similar work.  The types of design services may include, architecture and urban design; structural, civil, energy conservation, mechanical, electrical, seismic and geotechnical engineering, space planning and systems furniture integration, interior design, signage, technical and physical security, communication, RF shielding system design, blast protection design, fire protection engineering, potable water treatment and waste water treatment, landscaping design, cost estimating, scheduling, value engineering, and administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved.  The work must comply with either the applicable U.S. Government codes, regulations and standards, or the host country/city laws, codes and standards, whichever is more stringent.  Building design submission shall use hard metric units (Systems International).  Design submission phases will be identified in each task order and will typically include schematic design, design development (60%) submission, and construction document (100 %) submission.  Design deliverables shall include construction drawings in AutoCAD, specifications, schedule of rates/bill of quantities, reports and calculations.  Construction services may include labor and materials to execute the OBO approved design; on-site organization with management of lines of authority to ensure overall project coordination; overall control throughout the life of the project.  Services include documentation submittals and institution of controlling programs such as:  quality control program, construction scheduling, cost control, and project close-out.  Background information on the Standard Embassy Design may be viewed at:  http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/37418.pdf.  Closing:  ALL SUBMITTALS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 2:00 P.M.

<DESC>Sources Sought for High-Throughput Screening (HTS) and Toxicogenomic Services The EPA?s National Center for Computational Toxicology is conducting research into the utility of high-throughput screening (HTS) and toxicogenomic technologies for Agency use.  The long-range goal is to establish methods capable of categorizing and predicting the toxicity of the large number of chemicals the Agency addresses. At this point we are seeking information about potential small business vendors/sources for the assays and analytical tools required for a chemical categorization and prioritization research project designed to have the ability to predict toxicity. Initially, this would entail a demonstration project based upon a set of 200-400 chemicals with a rich toxicological database representative of a number of structural classes and phenotypic outcomes. The project would evaluate chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains: physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities based on existing structure-activity models, biochemical properties based on HTS assays, cell based phenotypic assays, and genomic or metabonomic analysis of cells or organisms.  The goal of the project would be to mine the resulting data for associations between and among the various domains and the known toxicological properties of the base set of chemicals, in order to provide a structured strategy to categorize chemicals, identify potential toxicities and pathways, and to prioritize chemicals based on this predicted toxicity.   It is worth noting that many of the chemicals we would like to characterize have a wide variation in potency for a variety of endpoints, and are not just highly active (pharmacological) compounds. In addition, false negatives in predicting toxicity must be minimized. These are key issues distinguishing this Agency effort from prior pharmaceutical HTS efforts, and will impact how assays are actually carried out (e.g., concentrations of chemicals being tested, reagent concentrations, etc?) Another general point worth mentioning is that many of these chemicals must be metabolized to become biologically/toxicologically active. Thus many assays may have to be run both with and without exogenous metabolic activation systems.  Beyond the base set of several hundred chemicals or samples, we would like the option to process up to several thousand additional chemicals or samples, and have the flexibility to order over a multi-year period. We would prefer services to be broken down into rational sets of similar type, that could be selected from a pre-priced schedule of items as appropriate for Agency purposes.  Through this announcement, we are trying to identify possible small business commercial sources that can provide the chemicals, data and data analysis for this project. We would like to gather information on vendors/sources for 12 different types of services and assays.  Based on the information gathered, a subset of these services/assays would be pursued further and defined in one or more Statements of Work (within a single Request for Proposals).  We expect that various vendors will be able to provide each of these services.  In some cases, vendors may only offer a single type of service or assay, while in other cases a single vendor may offer multiple types of services/assays.  It is conceivable that a single vendor might be able to provide all of these types of services. The applicable NAICS Code is 541380 with a size standard of $10M.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND  IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  Interested parties should respond with information that clearly demonstrates their capability, experience and qualifications relative to any of the 12 specified areas listed in the draft statement of work located on the EPA web site at http://www.epa.gov/ oamrtnc/0610151/index.htm.  Responses to the announcement are due by 3:00 PM EST, January 6, 2006.  The contact point for this announcement is McDonald Morrison who can be reached at (919) 541-4364 or morrison.mcdonald@epa.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command has a requirement for depot-level support of the CFM56-2A-2 engine for the E-6B program.  The CFM56-2A-2 is a General Electric/SNECMA (CFM International) commercial engine.  The E-6B has four CFM56-2A-2 engines on each of the 16 aircraft.  The proposed procurement will be a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) strategy.  The contractor will provide complete engine maintenance above O-Level to support the needs of the entire E-6B fleet, 75 engines total (64 on-wing/11 spares) and total integrated logistics support including the provision of all spare engines, Weapon Replaceable Assemblies (WRA), obsolescence management, reliability and maintainability management, configuration management, commercial technology insertion, transportation, sustaining engineering (SE) and any other innovative supply support solutions plus the labor necessary for such maintenance.  The engine must be returned to the fleet “O” level personnel with QECK components installed.  The contractor will coordinate with the platform Contractor Logistic Support provider to replenish O-Level engine WRA inventories. Use of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) approved parts and components will be required.  Based on current flight hour projections, the anticipated scheduled maintenance for additional workload will be seven (7) engines in FY09, four (4) engines in FY10, two (2) engines in FY11, eight (8) engines in FY12, three (3) engines in FY13, five (5) engines in FY14, six (6) engines in FY15 and eight (8) engines in FY16.  It is also anticipated that an additional unscheduled maintenance workload of four (4) engines per year for the life of the contract may be required.  This is subject to change since forecasting for unscheduled maintenance is strictly based on historical data.  The Government is also interested in the feasibility of establishing a public-private teaming arrangement between the successful offeror and the current organic depot (OC-ALC).

The contractor will be accountable for maintaining the entire inventory throughout the duration of the contract and that the contractor will be held to the availability metrics in the contract, for example:

 Engine Availability
-  12-hours delivery to STRATCOMMWINGONE, Tinker AFB with required SE
-  Four (4) War Reserve engines available to STRATCOMMWINGONE 24/7 
-  Material Availability (Issued From CLS Inventory) 
·	WRA 1 Hour
·	Component 1 Hour

Engine Reliability
-  3,400 Cycles Scheduled Maintenance
-  1,750 Cycles Unscheduled Maintenance
	 
Communications
-  24/7 OEM Field Service Representative (FSR) Technical Specialist as required.  Collect monthly engine hours and cycles data from the Government and perform analysis to assist in maintenance planning. 

A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) would be beneficial for budgetary planning.      Additionally any respondent should provide information that supports their qualifications for this effort.  The Navy is also interested in companies that would like to conduct a site tour of their facilities.  AT THIS TIME, NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST.  This sources sought announcement is not a contract, or a request for proposal, or a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind.  The Navy will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for travel expenses, presentations, marketing efforts or data related any data offered for examination; therefore, the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.

The Government reserves the right to review and use data at its own discretion.  Upon request, NAVAIR will protect proprietary information from unwanted disclosure. Send two copies of the responses by mail or E-mail to: Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command (Attn: Christina Hall, AIR-2.3.1.4), 47123 Buse Road, Unit #IPT, Building 2272 (Suite 155), Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547 or christina.hall@navy.mil.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) intends to procure a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the Window Sill Replacement at the Norfolk Federal Building.   It is GSA's intent to solicit this requirement through a small business set-aside, utilizing Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Source Selection procedures.  The LPTA method, FAR 15.101-2, has been determined by the GSA Project Team to be in the best interests of the Government.  The NAICS for this procurement is code 238350.The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price contract.

The work includes but is not limited to the removal of both the interior and exterior trim pieces along with the windows and frames in order to install a sill pan.  As part of the contract requirements the contractor shall take digital photos of the entire window sill after window removal and prior to re-installing the windows.  These photos will be used to document the conditions and be used by the inspection agent to insure compliance with the installation details and for quality assurance.  The attached elevations represent the building views and identify pan sills that are to be replaced.  The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining a weather barrier as windows are removed and replaced.  Any windows that will remain out overnight shall have the openings temporary secured using plywood (or suitable substitute) with a weather barrier.  Upon reinstalling of windows they shall be immediately cleaned inside and out using approved cleaning products.  

For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly 
received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, “Lowest price technically acceptable source selection process”. As defined in FAR 15.101-2 (a) the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. FAR 15.101-1 (b) (1) states that the evaluation factors and significant sub factors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the solicitation. The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factors as requirements for acceptability; 1.) Firm lists a minimum of three (3) projects completed in the past ten (10) years of a similar scope of work that have a total construction value of at least $500,000.00. Two of the three projects must have been completed in an occupied building.  2) Superintendent shall submit resume demonstrating that he/she has 10 years of experience as a superintendent.  Since the Contracting Officer has elected to utilize past performance as an evaluation factor the procedures detailed in FAR 15.305, “Proposal evaluation”, shall be followed. All proposals received shall be evaluated for acceptability but shall not be ranked using non-cost/ price factors.

The RFP is scheduled to be available on or about April 7, 2006. The subject solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified Building Information (SBU).  For reasons of security and before release of SBU information, the requestor must complete and sign a "Document Security Notice to Prospective Bidders/Offerors" included in this notice.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) Warrants; 
(ii) Options; 
(iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) Convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) Others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure.

Most insulated booths have a 3 sided mix room connected to booth with personnel door from booth opening directly into mix room. Then you have an additional mix room personnel door at front of mix room.

Answer #1:  We are looking to use the booth as the 4th wall. However, I did not want a direct access door from the mixing room to the booth as I do not have the floor space for the size the mix room that would be required. As I understand the Stafford County code, by the time we factor in the min space requirements for door swings, the mix room becomes too big for the space where it will be installed.

Question #2: Does Mezzanine restrict height of booth to 10' 5" high?

Answer #2:  The underside of the mezzanine and existing sprinklers restrict the space to a 10'-5" clearance.
 
Question #3:  Can Air Make-up Unit be Vertical setting beside booth - same height as booth?

Answer #3:  Install the air makeup unit on top of the mezzanine over the spray booth. Again, there is not much space on the floor for anything more than the booth and mix room.

Question #4:  Will the Air Make-up and Mix Room be on same side of spray booth?
 
Answer #4. The air makeup unit will be on the mezzanine over top of the spray booth.
