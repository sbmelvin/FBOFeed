<RESPDATE>110211
<ARCHDATE>11032011
<CONTACT>Pamela Franzel, Contracting Officer, Fax (703) 292-9140, Email pfranzel@nsf.gov
<DESC>The National Science Foundation intends to solicit and award a contract, on a sole-source basis, to Air New Zealand, Limited for continued planned depot level maintenance (PDM), Ski System PDM and unscheduled drop-in depot level repair/ maintenance (UDLM), for 10 ski-equipped LC-130 aircraft. The estimated value of this procurement is $30,000,000, which includes one depot level PDM for 2012, 2013 and 2014 and two depot level PDMs per year for 2015 and 2016 over 5 years. Costs for Ski System depot level PDMs and UDLM work are included in the total.
<p>The U.S. Air National Guard's 109th Air Wing out of Scotia, New York supplies all medium and long range intra-continental airlift support for the USAP using the Lockheed LC-130 transport aircraft. The 10 LC aircraft are comprised of four NSF aircraft and six 109th AW aircraft operated and maintained by the Department of Defense for logistical support to the NSF in accordance with Presidential Memorandum 6646. These aircraft are Air Force configured. As such, they must be maintained per U.S. Air Force (USAF) standards and technical orders at USAF recognized/authorized depot-level repair facilities. The UDLM work generally occurs during the USAP's operating season from October through February with the PDMs generally occurring during the austral winter. Only LC-130 ski equipped aircraft are capable of USAP mission support on a year-round basis. In order to maximize aircraft availability in the Antarctic theater, NSF requires ready access to PDM/UDLM facilities for both aircraft and skis. It is an Air Force requirement that the contractor performing PDM must inspect the skis in accordance with the C-130 PDM Specification and be proficient in any resulting repair.</p>
<p>Christchurch, New Zealand is the USAP's forward logistics and staging base from which all USAP LC-130 flights to the Antarctic continent originate. Since 2002, all maintenance, repairs, UDLM work, PDM work and Ski System maintenance and PDMs on NSF and AF LC-130s have been performed in Christchurch, NZ. PDMs are completed on each aircraft every 69.5 months, as directed by USAF standards. This equates to a requirement for one-to-two LC-130s receiving a PDM every year.</p>
<p>NSF published a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis for interested parties for support of the USAP LC-130 program in Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) on May 6, 2011 (refer to FBO, Solicitation Number NSF- DACS11P2166). Of the companies responding to the RFI, four expressed an interest in performing UDLM in addition to PDM. Two of the four proposed that all maintenance be performed in their home countries, which are located several thousand miles further than the current location of Christchurch, NZ from McMurdo in Antarctica. These distances are considered unacceptable for aviation safety. One company was willing to perform both types of maintenance within a marginally acceptable distance, however, that company had no experience with or facilities available to perform Ski System PDMs or maintenance.</p>
<p>After a reassessment of the requirement based on the results of the RFI, the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) examined possible locations for different elements of the maintenance work to be performed. Based on information received from the Air Force as well as flight distance limitations of the LC-130 aircraft, OPP concluded that there is a firm requirement that all work for all aircraft and ski PDM as well as drop-in work be done at the same physical location in Christchurch, NZ. The only firm that can meet NSF's requirement for co-located PDM, UDLM and Ski services with UDLM work being performed in Christchurch is Air New Zealand.</p>
<p>Based upon the information available, the NSF considers Air New Zealand, Limited to be the only responsible source per the statutory authority at 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Within 15 days from the date of publication of this notice, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the NSF. NSF will consider whether or not the source is qualified and able to perform the required services for the stated period without adversely affecting the NSF mission in Antarctica.</p>

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>1.  Background
The FAA is charged with maintaining the safest, most efficient airspace system in the world. The National Airspace System (NAS) consists of a complex collection of systems, procedures, facilities, aircraft, and people. The NAS and the technologies it uses are constantly evolving. With increasing demand for flights in limited airspace, the FAA is constantly working to balance demand and capacity by minimizing delays and congestion while maximizing volume. The Air Traffic Organization represents the Terminal, En Route, System Operations, and Technical Operations workforces that ensure safety and efficiency within the NAS. The Technical Operations workforce includes those charged with installation, testing, troubleshooting, repair, monitoring, and certification of systems and equipment used to maintain the NAS.  As Technical Operations hires new employees to ensure its facilities are safely staffed for the air traffic of tomorrow, the Office of Technical Operations Training Administration serves as a bridge to the future by providing technical training programs that meet requirements set by the operational service units.
2.  Introduction/Purpose
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) needs to expand its resource base of deliverers for training the Air Transportation System Specialists (ATSS). The goal is to improve the availability of this training to the specialists and in the long term reduce costs.
The FAA is looking for suitable vendors to provide delivery of training to our technical workforce in the areas of Non certifiable systems training and Foundational courses. The Non certifiable systems training cover the following areas: Fiber optics, HVAC, Boilers, Chillers, & building Environmental systems. Foundational courses cover the following systems: Radar Systems, Navigation Systems, Instrument Landing systems, Environmental system and Automation Systems.
The FAA has a need to explore the industries capabilities on furnishing training facilities and conduct training. The FAA needs to know where the provider would conduct the training, information regarding their training facility and their capacity for through put of students. The FAA wants to know the providers' delivery capability of offering more than one class per year.The FAA wants to find out what resources are available and the associated cost to conduct foundational courses and non certifiable national airspace systems training.  To conduct training for FAA Air Transportation System Specialists with FAA supplied courseware. The providers must have faculty/instructors with the required electrical/electronics expertise in support of the delivery of technical training courses.
The FAA will provide the courseware electronically, however the provider is encouraged to provide the capabilities of disseminating the training materials to the FAA students.
The FAA requires that the provider conduct the classes on a daily one shift basis, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, Monday through Friday.  Training is to be continuous during these days except for federally established holidays.  Local or state holidays must not interrupt the training period.  Normal hours must be from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. with  hour for lunch; or from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. with 1 hour for lunch.

<DESC>The Department of Interior (DoI) Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for Space Staff (EA4SS) through the use of the Interior Franchise Fund (IFF) is seeking to obtain market research from vendors to assist the Government in understanding the capabilities available in the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) industry and inform the development of a way-ahead for the EA4SS to obtain SETA services for the defense space enterprise.  Additionally, the market research will assist the Government in determining how small business could fit into EA4SS' acquisition strategy.  The full Request for Information (RFI) may be found at http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/Business/openmarket.aspx.
The EA4SS was established to assist the DoD leadership in integrating and coordinating Defense space activities.  To effectively plan, integrate, and coordinate these highly complex space and space-related systems of systems, the EA4SS must be involved in a wide range of activities, including joint service activities, leveraging commercial technologies, developing new business approaches; and defining space and space-related solutions, and their relationship to terrestrial, maritime, and air solutions, to warfighter and national intelligence needs.  EA4SS's efforts require collaboration and integration of ongoing activities across the NSS community to include DoD operational commands, acquisition centers and laboratories, IC organizations, other services and national agencies, and commercial and international organizations.
EA4SS's mission is to create and communicate critical information, such as the NSS Plan and the annual NSS Program Assessment, unavailable elsewhere, to support decisions affecting future space and space-related systems for the operation, control and exploitation of national security space.  To this end, EA4SS's strength is to lead the DoD toward a future unified and integrated national security space enterprise by creating innovative alternatives backed by sound systems engineering, integration, and architectural concepts and principles.
The primary responsibilities of the EA4SS are to:-Develop and coordinate for community consideration using appropriate NSS policies, strategies, concepts, plans, architectures for mid-to-long terms, enterprise engineering activities, and transition strategies.-Assess NSS and DS strategies, architectures, plans, programs, and processes on an on-going basis.-Advise, as requested, various defense and intelligence acquisition and requirements boards on space-related topics.-Advise senior DoD management and their staffs on matters affecting or affected by NSS and DS capabilities.-Provide independent, objective analyses and advice, on requirements, policies, strategies, plans, programs, budgets, acquisition and professional development activities.-Facilitate the coordination of requirements, the resulting end-to-end architectures, and other NSS and DS products.
The EA4SS Government teams works within a collaborative environment, teaming with SETA support contractors daily to fulfill mission requirements within a TS/SCI environment.  The EA4SS requires consolidated SETA support for EA4SS's planning, engineering, architecting, acquisition management and analytical efforts, preparation of briefings and documents, conduct of document reviews, support of meeting execution, and other related activities.  The Contractor may interface with and leverage other agencies and industries' efforts as required.  It is essential that the SETA contractor be able to supply the necessary expertise (approximately 60 FTE) as well as function as members of complex and often changing teams of government and industry representatives from a variety of agencies.
This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the Government will not reimburse for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in a future RFP, if one is issued.
This RFI is seeking responses from small businesses that can provide the required services under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990 "All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services", applies with a small business size standard of $7,000,000.
The data obtained from this RFI will assist the Government in understanding the capabilities available in the SETA services industry marketplace and to inform the development of a way-ahead for the EA4SS to obtain SETA support services in support of the defense space enterprise and NSS.  Additionally, the market research will assist the Government in determining how small business could fit into the EA4SS' acquisition strategy.  In order to make a determination for a small business set-aside, two or more small businesses must submit responses that demonstrate their qualifications and their capability to fully satisfy the assessment criteria cited in this RFI.  Responses must demonstrate the company's ability to perform in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting Clause (FAR 52.219-14) which requires the small business to perform at least 50 percent of the work on the contract.
Marketing brochures and/or generic company literature will not be considered.  Not addressing all the requested information may result in the Government determining the responder is not capable of performing the scope of work required.
Interested small businesses meeting the small business standard of $7M for NAICS code 541990 are requested to submit a response by 9:00AM EDT on 25 Oct 2011 to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Kimberly Luke, Kimberly.Luke@aqd.nbc.gov.  Submissions shall be submitted electronically and not exceed twenty-five (25) pages.  Paper copies will not be accepted.  Late responses will only be accepted if they contain extraordinary value to the Government.  The responses must include the business size of the vender under NAICS code 541990 (Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Women-Owned Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Small Business, Historically Black College and University/Minority Institution, Small Business Joint Venture, Consortium, Team Partnering, or Large Business).

<CONTACT>Vicki W Dean, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-1263, Fax (301) 757-2296, Email vicki.dean@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract on a sole-source basis to Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC), Rolling Meadows, IL for the procurement of LITENING Pods (LPOD), related Weapons Repairable Assemblies (WRAs), spares, parts and services, support, repair, and upgrades to existing pods and for integration of the LPOD in the AV-8B Harrier (domestic and Allied), F/A-18 Hornet (domestic and FMS), EA-6B Prowler, and U.S. Air Force platforms. In addition, the contract will provide engineering, technical support, training, and technical data associated with the LPOD system. The expected ordering period for this contract will be from June 2013 to December 2015. The contract will provide for firm-fixed priced orders for the acquisition of:<br />a) Change kits, engineering prototyping, and testing of the change kits to upgrade existing LPOD units and associated WRA units to the latest configuration;<br />b) LPOD units: A maximum quantity of 400 LPODs/WRAs will be procured, or other such quantities as may be authorized and appropriated by Congress, as well as may be requested by Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Joint Program Office (JPO) Allied Countries; <br />c) Change kits to retrofit changes to existing spares required as a direct result of changes to LPOD;<br />d) Change kits to retrofit changes to Naval Air Maintenance Trainers, Operational Flight Trainers, Weapon System Trainers, and other Training Equipment and devices as required as a direct result of changes to LPOD;<br />e) Contractor installation of change kits;<br />f) Technical manuals/directives, new or revised, to include changes resulting from approved Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs);<br />g) Change kits, engineering prototyping, and testing of change kits to retrofit changes to support equipment (SE) required as a result of changes to LPOD;<br />h) Logistics support analysis of new or modified parts installed as a result of change kits;<br />i) Materials/services to repair, modify, and/or return to ready-for-issue condition LPODs and associated WRAs, which are returned to NG for repair;<br />j) Technical data for the above items;<br />k) On-site engineering and technical assistance to provide Pod Repair Support (PRS) for the LPOD;<br />l) On-site training support;<br />m) Spare and repair parts.
<p><br />Rafael Corporation's Missiles Division in Haifa, Israel is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the LPOD system and is the only manufacturer with the knowledge, experience, and technical data necessary to provide the required supplies and services. NGC is the sole United States distributor of the Rafael LPOD. As such, NGC is the only source able to provide the total system integration and sustainment support necessary to complete the required efforts, and perform the complex array of tasks for which they will have performance responsibility. The original AV-8 contract for LPOD was awarded on 21 April 2000 as a sole source to NGC through the USAF 647th Aeronautical Systems Squadron Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The award was based upon the unusual and compelling urgency (FAR 6.302-2(c)) to provide 9 LITENING II precision attack targeting pods to the USMC in support of Operation Southern Watch and the Yugoslavian conflict. The Government does not possess adequate data and/or the rights necessary to competitively award this requirement. Proprietary manufacturing data and drawings were not purchased during the LPOD development. LPODS are in use today in Afghanistan. Any delay will result in needed assets, repairs, and upgrades not being available in a timely manner to address Overseas Contingency Operations requirements. NGC is deemed to be the only source available because an award to a source other than the original would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the Government's requirements. Going to another source would create a delay of approximately 5-6 years. PMA-257 estimates that it would take approximately 12 months to secure a contract vehicle to procure the necessary technical data rights, a minimum of 18 months to take the data rights and conduct a competition to fulfill targeting pod requirements and qualification and operational release by the various aircraft platform program offices would delay Fleet delivery of the required capability for actual operational use a minimum of an additional 24 months. FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source grants the Government the authority to award this requirement on a Sole Source basis.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSISLaser Based N2O Measurement System

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Assessment and Standards Division, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, intends to purchase a Laser Based N20 Measurement System.  The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject to full and open competition and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is  334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is mandated to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from motor vehicles.  Work to date on measurement of N2O has indicated that N2O concentrations in dilute exhaust gas will range from 310 ppb to 1000 ppb, requiring a highly accurate analyzer.  
Investigation of Infrared Red source type analyzers including Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), and the Photoacoustic Spectrometer (PAS) has indicated that these technologies suffer from interference in the N2O absorption band from CO, CO2, and H2O.  Although these technologies make attempts to correct for the interference, the concentrations of these gases in motor vehicle exhaust are too great in some cases to provide adequate correction at sub-1000 ppb N2O levels. 
Gas chromatography has some analytical advantages compared to Infrared Instruments, but existing instruments are not well suited to the integrated real time process measurement functions associated with automotive gaseous emissions testing.
Recently, in response to new N2O emission regulations, instrument manufacturers have developed laser based infrared spectrometers in which the source emits infrared radiation in a narrow band width.  This, in turn, eliminates the opportunity for interference as the infrared wavelength emitted by the source is focus on the region where N2O absorbs.
For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation and training of EPA staff, if required. The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance.
The N2O analyzer will be used for the batch analysis of dilute exhaust gas sampled from a Kynar bag.  The system will be installed in chassis test site D329 at the NVFEL.  This test site is equipped with a Horiba MEXA-7000 system for both continuous and bag analysis of criteria pollutants, and a Horiba CDTCS test cell host computer.
The analyzer will be installed directly on the concrete floor in the test cell.  The analyzer operation shall be integrated into the MEXA-7000 analyzer software and shall also be integrated into the CDTCS test cell host computer.  This integration shall include the ability to fully control the analyzer functions, and data collection, processing and reporting, in keeping with the current operation of the MEXA-7000 and CDTCS at NVFEL.		Only commercially available systems offering this demonstrated level of integration into a MEXA-7000 system and CDTCS test cell host system will be considered for this solicitation.
The N2O analyzer shall meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 1065 in terms of features, performance, usage requirements and calibration/verification requirements.
The combined interference from the maximum concentrations of the interference gases (for example CO, CO2, and H2O) that are at least a high as that expected during testing shall not exceed ?5 % of the flow-weighted mean concentration of N2O expected at the light-duty passenger car standard of 10 mg/mi.
Zero and span drift shall each be less than ? 1% FSD over 4 hours.
The N2O analyzer shall have performance that provides robust chemical measurement at low and sub-PPM levels.  Analyzers shall utilize wide dynamic range technology and automatic range selection as required.
The linearization function shall be handled through the existing MEXA-7000 software and shall be designed to function according to the following parameters:a) Selection of up to a fourth order curve with the ability to select curve order.b) Option to allow the curve intercept to float or be forced to zero.c) Allowance to modify fit tolerance; default values shall be set at the minimum of 2.0% of point or 1.0% of full scale. Full scale in this sense shall be considered to be the highest concentration utilized in the linearization function.d) Secondary confirmation of curve fit and accuracy by utilizing an independent gas standard that is at an intermediate concentration; acceptable tolerance shall be modifiable in the same manner as curve fit tolerance above.  Default limit shall be ? 2.0% of point.e) Candidate curves shall not be made active automatically.
The contractor shall provide and install all necessary system plumbing, including heated sample lines, filters, heated and unheated sample probes and overflow calibration devices, and all required transfer tubing, fittings and valves. As installed there must be no contamination in sample plumbing that would be detectable on any range of the analyzer.  The analyzer shall have a purge function that includes back flush of sample lines.  This will be performed with zero-grade nitrogen.
The contractor shall provide plumbing for connection of analytical gases, and required utility gases, from an EPA-provided valve rack within approximately 20 feet, or less, of the instrument.  Gases will be supplied at nominal pressures specified by the contractor, regulated at the gas source.  Valve rack fittings will be for ? inch outside diameter tubing.  The contractor shall provide and install permanently-mounted stainless steel lines to connect to the valve rack and any additional gas shutoff valves, or regulators required by the contractor?s system. The ends of each line end shall be labeled with line number, gas type and nominal concentration
Plumbing for the transfer of zero and span gases, as well as the dilute exhaust samples, shall be of 316 stainless steel tubing passivated and electro-polished (Ra<10).  Short lengths of Teflon? tubing may be used to facilitate final connection to analyzers.  All solenoid valves shall have stainless steel bases and plungers constructed of a durable material which does not out-gas or otherwise change the composition of the gas flowing past them.
Each analyzer shall have one span gas and one mid-span gas inlet per active range.  Span gases may be shared between analyzers and ranges, where concentrations permit.  Span concentrations shall be between 85% and 95% of the nominal upper range concentration.  Mid-span gases shall be between 10% and 60% of the nominal upper range concentration.
Prior to final acceptance, the contractor shall comprehensively demonstrate that the provided test system fulfills all requirements of this statement of work.  
Evidence shall include, but not be limited to:a)  Compliance with all referenced portions of the CFR.b)  Successful performance of CFR system verifications.c)  Verification of analyzer accuracy.d)  Verification of complete integration with the MEXA/CDTCS test system including functionality and data collection, processing, and reportinge)  Successful completion of EPA regulatory vehicle tests demonstrating full compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations.f)  Successful performance of other automated functions outlined in this Statement of Work including proper function of quality control monitoring and safety monitoring as applicable.g)  Evidence that all other requirements of this Statement of Work have been fulfilled.h)  System documentation as detailed above.
Training shall be provided by the device manufacturer and shall include full descriptions of all functions of the system, including hardware, software, operation and maintenance.  The training shall accommodate up to eight (8) persons.  
The analyzer electrical components shall be sufficiently shielded to minimize interference and inaccuracies due to electromagnetic fields created by laboratory equipment.
The contractor shall provide on-site supervision of all installation, commissioning and acceptance activities.  All contractor personnel shall receive 1-hour briefing by EPA personnel on specific safety and security issues.  All contractor personnel and subcontractor personnel must comply with EPA/NVFEL safety and security measures while working at NVFEL.  Typically, work may be undertaken at NVFEL between the hours of 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM Monday through Friday, with the exception of Federal holidays.
Award will be made on a Best Value, Technically Acceptable Basis.  All non-price evaluation criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Anticipated non-price evaluation criteria include demonstrated ability of the proposed system to meet or exceed the SOW requirements; past performance record under comparable contracts; and relevant corporate experience.  
It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted on or about November 3, 2011 at  the EPA home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov).  The direct link URL for the solicitation when issued is http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. It is the responsibility of the offerors to monitor the EPA website for changes or updates. No hard copies will be available. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p><br />Contracting Office Address<br />General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service (PBS), 1099 14th Street, NW, 200 W, Washington, DC 20005.</p>
<p>Requirement<br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Rockville, MD, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 50,918 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 44,883 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet (ABOA). The lease term required is for five (5) years with annual termination rights after the third (3rd) year. The space must be available for occupancy by May of 2011. The delineated area is:</p>
<p>North: Wootton Parkway to First Street;<br />East: Route 28 to Veirs Mill Road;<br />South: Randolph Road to Montrose Road;<br />West: North bound side of I-270</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current applicable federal, state, and local government building codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in this transaction. In no event shall a potential Offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized offices and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, CB Richard Ellis, Inc.</p>
<p>Owners, brokers or agents may offer space for consideration. Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Building name, address, and age;<br />2. Available square footage (ANSI/BOMA Office Area, rentable and usable);<br />3. Schedule for completion and occupancy date;<br />4. Rental rate informational quotation per rentable square foot, inclusive of <br />a Tenant Improvement Allowance of $42.08 per ABOA square foot;<br />5. Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space;<br />6. Site Plan showing parking spaces, loading areas, and vehicular circulation;<br />7. Information on project and building ownership.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement. In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide a specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the potential building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements. With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume a maximum rental rate taking into consideration lease prospectus limitations and thresholds in the event the respondent fails to include such information.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest must be in writing and should be forwarded by 3:00 pm (EST) on Wednesday, January 26, 2011 to: <br /><br />CB Richard Ellis, Inc. <br />750 9th Street, NW<br />Washington, DC 20001<br />ATTN: Chad S.

<DESC><strong>General Information:<br /></strong>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified organizations to perform a potential requirement.
<p><strong>Background:<br /></strong>The widespread use of organophosphate (OP) pesticides results in human exposure through a variety of sources including residues in food. Upon intake, most OP pesticides are metabolized to one or more of six (6) dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites. Thus, levels of DAP metabolites in urine reflect exposure to one or more OP pesticides. Experimental studies have suggested developmental neurotoxicity from low level exposure to OP pesticides, resulting in neurobehavioral symptoms. Human data in populations with background-level exposure to OP pesticides are suggestive of an adverse effect, but additional data of higher quality than the existing data are needed to assess risk in greater detail.</p>
<p>Several aspects of study design and population affect the quality of results. To achieve an improvement in quality over existing studies the following attributes are needed: a) improved estimate of exposure, b) level of exposure higher than in previous studies, c) larger sample size, and d) assessment of outcome at least as good as has been done in existing studies (meaning an in-person examination).</p>
<p>NIEHS recently published the results of an analysis of urine samples from pregnant women in the Generation R cohort study (the cohort is described later in this document). Metabolites were measured in urine from 100 women collected from February of 2004 through April 2006. The data indicate that Generation R mothers had higher levels of OP exposure than did US women. Furthermore, Generation R mothers had 3-fold higher levels of total dimethyl alkyl metabolites than did pregnant women in CHAMACOS study in California where an association between prenatal OP exposure and screening positive for autism and ADHD in children was observed. The dimethyl alkyl metabolite levels in Generation R was also 4-fold higher than in the Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Cohort Study (New York), where prenatal levels of DAP metabolites were associated with anomalies in primitive reflexes, a critical marker of neurologic integrity. OPs are metabolized and excreted in the urine usually within 24-48 hours of exposure. This short half life means that measuring OP metabolites in one (1) or two (2) urine specimens provides a poor measure of exposure over pregnancy. Use of three (3) urine specimens from different times in pregnancy greatly improves the ability to estimate exposure.</p>
<p>The Generation R Study enrolled pregnant women and their partners and is following them and their children over time (Jaddoe et al., 2006; Jaddoe et al., 2008). Nearly all pregnant women in Rotterdam were eligible. Enrollment began in 2002 and ended in 2006. Nearly 10,000 pregnant women and their offspring were enrolled. Women in the study provided biologic specimens and completed questionnaires about themselves and their children, and in-person follow-up examinations take place on a regular basis. The Generation R Study has many specific goals, although the general purpose of this study is to find causes of serious diseases among mothers and children.</p>
<p>In February of 2004, NIEHS began supporting an increase in the number of urine specimens collected from each pregnant woman from 1 to 3 (at &lt;18, 18-25, and &gt; 25 weeks of gestation). As each pregnant woman presented for an ultrasound examination of her fetus, she provided a spot urine specimen that was divided into three 20 ml aliquots and frozen at -20 oC in polypropylene containers. Two of these aliquots are reserved for collaborative studies with NIEHS. Before NIEHS initiated collection of additional urine specimens, urine was collected only at the &lt;18 weeks of pregnancy (initial) study ultrasound visit. When the collection of additional urine specimens was implemented, all women presenting for their study ultrasound (at &lt;18, 18-25, and &gt;25 weeks of gestation) provided a urine specimen that was stored, regardless of whether urine specimens had been collected at earlier ultrasound visits. Thus, for Generation R Study subjects enrolled from February 2004 through January 2006, there exists a complete set of three (3) urines for 2,025 women, two (2) urines for 970 women, and one (1) urine for 356 women. The urine specimens collected with NIEHS support can be used to assess the level of exposure to selected environmental contaminants and other compounds. The Generation R Study Management Team at Erasmus University governs the use of the samples and associated data.<br /><br />As part of the Generation R Study in-person follow-up examination of children at age five (5)years, the examination will include: 1) the Berkeley Puppet Interview for children's self perceptions in six (6) domains (academic competence, achievement motivation, social competence, peer acceptance, depression-anxiety, and aggression-hostility); 2) the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-IV) for ADHD Diagnoses and other Clinical DSM Disorders; 3) an Autism Trait List (SCQ), administered by a child psychiatrist (in selected children after pre-screening on e.g. parent/teacher reported symptoms; and 4) an assessment of cognitive performance using both verbal intelligence and non-verbal intelligence testing (Dutch SON-R test). Thus, examining levels of environmental contaminants, as measured in urine specimens, in relation to risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cognitive abilities, and other neuropsychiatric and behavioral abnormalities will be possible. The age five (5) follow-up is scheduled to end in 2011. The expected number of subjects who will have both three (3) urine specimens and in-person follow up is approximately 1,200, making the sample size much larger than existing studies.</p>
<p>The ongoing work of the Generation R Study involves primarily three types of activities: a) follow-up of subjects and collection of specimens, b) specimen processing, storage, and management in support of research, and c) data processing, storage, and management in support of research. This requirement is not only to support continuation of the work in items b) and c), but also supports personnel and develops tools to enhance use of the samples and data by NIEHS, and collaboration with NIEHS. These personnel and tools include relationships and administrative procedures and support to facilitate: the development and evaluation of projects initiated at NIEHS; obtaining human subjects approval in the Netherlands for projects initiated at NIEHS; identification, pulling and shipping of specimens for specific studies; and responses to requests for various types of data.</p>
<p>The environmental studies based on the Generation R Study are coordinated by Dr. Frank Pierik, who is at TNO (Nederlandse Organisatie voor Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek, or Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research), which is a separate organization from Erasmus University, where the Generation R Study is based.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source<br><br>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement for a follow-on contract for the Threat Information Operations Systems (TIOS) formerly known as the RAVEN Contract, to develop and build operationally relevant threat information operation systems to support Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support (ES), and Computer Network Operations (CNO) for the Test and Evaluation of U.S. Systems.<br>This synopsis is to announce PEO STRI's intent to pursue a sole source Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) award with General Dynamics C4 Systems, Inc. (GDC4S).  The scope of the ID/IQ contract will include the work required to design, develop, operate and maintain threat signal simulators including the operation and maintenance of actual threat EA/ES systems in support of developmental and operational test events conducted by the Department of Defense.  The TIOS vehicle will develop and build operationally relevant threat information operation systems to support live, virtual, and constructive Electronic Attack and Electronic Support operations for Test and Evaluation (T&E) events.  <br>Support for EA will be accomplished via the utilization of the Synthetic Battlefield Emitter System (SBES), which provides an emitter system to target and test against, and the continued development of the incorporation of Intelligence Modeling and Simulation for Evaluation (IMASE), which will provide a suite of capabilities for the enhanced planning and execution of scenarios for operational testing of Intelligence Electronic Warfare (IEW) System Under Test (SUT).  Support for CNO will be realized through the continued development of the Network Exploitation Test Tool (NETT), which provides capabilities to perform CNO, Computer Network Attack (CNA), and Computer Network Exploitation (CNE).  Also included under the TIOS will be the continued development of the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the Integrated Threat Force (ITF).  The ITF provides the U.S. Army with an adaptable and scalable means for command and control.  Threat Collaboration, Communications, and Visualization of these threat assets, along with the appropriate hardware and software integration, will assist the T&E Community in realization of truly dynamic force-on-force testing of U.S. Systems.    <br>The ceiling for the TIOS effort is $84.5M.  This CPFF contract will have a total potential period of performance of five years; a basic year and 4 one year options.

Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the Homeless Veteran Supported Employment Program (HVSEP) Employment Development Training Plan

1. Background:
In FY 2011, VA medical centers were funded to hire over 400 new Vocational Rehabilitation Specialists (VRS) to provide vocational assistance, job development and placement and ongoing employment supports to homeless Veterans. These VRSs were required to be Veterans who themselves were homeless, formerly homeless, or at-risk of homelessness. Although these new staff have a shared identity with the target population, they may not have the personal or professional skills necessary to fulfill the mission of HVSEP. Specifically, the VRSs will need ongoing support and training in job development strategies, negotiations with employers, and skill enhancement related to working with complex Veterans in a sophisticated matrix model, i.e. administratively assigned to Compensated Work Therapy with day-to-day functions supervised by Homeless program staff. The uniqueness of this program will require training and support that is beyond what is available locally at most medical centers given the outcomes that are expected regarding the number of Homeless Veterans to be served and employed over the next few years. 
2.  Scope of Work:
Contractor will provide, hire, and supervise an estimated forty (40) consultants knowledgeable in the evidence based model of supported employment, to serve as advanced level job developers/employment training specialists in each of the VHA 21 VISNs. Their function is to provide individualized training, consultation, and mentoring services to the homeless, formerly homeless, or at-risk of homelessness Veterans who have been hired as VRSs to provide supported employment services to other homeless Veterans.

In addition, it is desired that GPD also provide an immediate/operational decontamination capability for aircraft exterior against chemical contamination.

The JSEW is considered to be a stand-alone capability.<br><br>Proposed products will be compared against the following criteria:<br>- Provides chemical efficacy test data (live agent or stimulant) for candidate against Nerve-G, Nerve-V and Blister-H. <br>- Provides complete Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and System Safety Assessment (SSA), which clearly identifies hazards (controllable and uncontrollable), active and inactive ingredients, product restrictions, and known safety hazards.<br>- Provides an analysis that clearly defines technology's compatibility with sensitive equipment, as defined in the JSEW Performance Specifications.  <br><br><br>General Purpose Decontaminant(s) (GPD):<br>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a GPD that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/personal weapons, in hostile and non-hostile environments, that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination thereby reducing health risk to friendly forces and non-combatants from CBRN contaminated assets.  In addition, it is desired that GPD also provide an immediate/operational decontamination capability for aircraft exterior against chemical contamination. An iterative Government evaluation process, combined with vendor-conducted product modification, will provide Government design control after Milestone (MS) B, and is key to ensuring integration of the GPD into Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS).  The GPD is considered to be a stand-alone capability.   <br><br>Proposed decontaminants will be compared against the following criteria:<br>- Provides chemical efficacy test data (live agent or simulant) for candidate against Nerve-G, Nerve-V and/or Blister-H; and/or biological efficacy test data (live agent or simulant) against bacterial endospores, vegetative bacteria, and viruses.<br>- Provides complete Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and System Safety Assessment (SSA), which clearly identifies hazards (controllable and uncontrollable), active and inactive ingredients, product restrictions, and known safety hazards.<br>- Provides an analysis that clearly defines technology's compatibility with equipment, as defined in the GPD Performance Specification.  <br><br>This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.  No solicitation exists at this time.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 1, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Cambria">CCO currently uses a project/assignment reporting tool called Project Tracking System (PTS), which is a Lotus Notes based application. Assignments, such as requests for legal interpretations, licensing decisions and investigations, are entered into the system by assigned Lead(s) and staff. These individuals report significant events, explanations and progress on assignments and matters until completion. Reports are generated from Lotus Notes views and used for management and discussions within CCO. The First Senior Deputy Comptroller/Chief Counsel (FSDC/CC) also uses PTS reports to discuss project progress in regular meetings with her counterparts in the Large Bank Supervision and the Midsize/Community Bank Supervision departments. The system is also used to report compliance with internal timeframes for rendering external opinions.</span></p>

<DESC>Title: Medical Simulation Training Center High-Fidelity Tetherless Mannequin<br><br>Contract Vehicle: Firm Fixed-Price<br><br>Closing Date: October 26, 2011, 3:00PM Eastern Standard Time<br><br>Brief Summary: The purpose of this Synopsis is to notify industry of the Government's intent to procure High-Fidelity Tetherless Mannequins on a full and open competitive basis.  The Government's requirement is for a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product that requires no alteration and meets the requirements of the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).<br><br>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (PM <br>CATT), Assistant Project Manager (APM) for Medical Simulation (MedSim) has a requirement to procure approximately 260 High-Fidelity Tetherless Mannequins to be delivered to various Medical Simulation Training Centers (MSTC) throughout the United States, Germany and South Korea.  The requirement will consist of the High-Fidelity Tetherless Mannequins, transit case, New Equipment Training, a commercial warranty that fully meets the requirements of the SOW, and the identification of and procurement of necessary consumables. <br><br>The MSTCs are standardized Army training assets located at various military installations worldwide, delivering effective medical training with a standardized training platform to better prepare Soldiers to apply medical interventions under combat conditions.  The MSTC provides medical training and education on new battlefield procedures and equipment, while affording Soldiers the ability to receive comprehensive training in several formats such as the classroom setting, practical hands-on training simulation, trauma lanes, and distance learning.<br><br>The Government conducted market research in March 2011 under solicitation number W900KK-11-R-0012; however, since then the requirement has significantly changed.  Previously, it was the Government's intent to procure both the Virtual Patient Simulators (VPS) and the hardware/ installation services that make-up a MSTC as a single procurement.  Market research and other resources have shown significant obstacles and inefficiencies with this approach, therefore, the Government will now be procuring the virtual patient simulators and the hardware/ installation services using separate contract vehicles.  In addition, each virtual patient simulator will be procured using separate contracts.  This particular synopsis pertains to the High-Fidelity Tetherless Mannequin only. <br><br>ACQUISITION APPROACH:<br>The Government anticipates using a Firm Fixed-Price contract, which includes a period of performance of one base year and four one-year options.  There may be optional CLINs in each year of the contract, to include the base year.  The exercise of the optional CLINs and optional years will be subject to the availability of funds.  This requirement will be procured using PART 12, Commercial Items and full and open competition.<br><br><br><br>TETHERLESS MANNEQUIN MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:  As one of the seven components of the Virtual patient Systems (VPS), Tetherless Mannequin simulators are required to fully give the trainee a realistic patient care scenario for both training and skills validation.  This High Fidelity Tetherless Mannequin shall allow complete evaluation in a trauma casualty assessment and the continuation of critical patient treatment across the continuum of care within the multiple pre-surgical environments encountered by our forces.<br><br>The Government is procuring COTS High-Fidelity Tetherless Mannequins that have the following minimum capabilities:<br><br>1. General - Ruggedized Tetherless with remote control that is water resistant and realistic.<br>2. Airway Features - Nose and nasal cavities capable of secretions, chest wall rising and falling, facial injuries and laryngeal spasms.<br>3. Facial Features - Blinking and reactive eyes with secretions that remotely reacts to blown, dilated and pin-point pupils.  Life-like ears capable of oozing blood and cerebrospinal fluid.<br>4. Trauma Features - Performs bilateral chest tube training, cricothyroidotomy and hemorrhage control.<br>5. Cardiac Features - EKG monitoring with the use of 5 leads.  Defibrillation and pacing.<br>6. Pulses - Brachial, radial, pedal, femoral and carotid artery pulse sites.<br>7. Blood Pressure - Arterial bleeding in 2 different locations, computer controlled bleeding flow rate.  Realistic training in reading blood pressure from a minimum of 1 arm to include palpitation and auscultation.<br>8. Needle Features - Needle decompression sites for tension pneumothorax with a minimum of 15 punctures.  Bi-lateral tension pneumothorax.  Intramuscular injections to include bilateral deltoids and bilateral thighs.<br>9. Sounds - Vocal sounds and breath sounds to include:  absent, clear, rails, rhonchi, wheezes, and striders in anatomically correct positions.  Normal and abnormal heart sounds, bowel sounds and throat sounds.<br>10. Intravenous - IV insertion in the arm, hand, femoral vein, internal and external jugular veins and subclavian veins, all with initial flash cue.<br>11. Genitourinary - Catheterization of male and female genitalia with urine and urine/blood mix output.  Physiologically correct, full-sized human (min. 180 lbs male and min 135 lbs female).<br>12. Latex - All equipment must be latex free.<br><br>Potential Offerors must refer to the attached MSTC VPS Tetherless Mannequin Acquisition Draft SOW for a more detailed set of requirements.<br><br>QUANTITIES: Each MSTC will require 5 High-Fidelity Tetherless Mannequins.  There will be approximately 37 mission funded MSTC locations and 15 customer funded locations.   <br><br>RESPONSES REQUESTED: <br>A draft SOW is attached to this synopsis and the Government welcomes any questions or comments that would assist in further defining the requirement and procurement strategy.  Comments and questions must be submitted by the closing date of this synopsis to Mr. Chi "Tony" Pham via e-mail at chi.pham@us.army.mil and Mr. Felix R Marrero at felix.r.marrero@us.army.mil.

<p>Hypothetical example, propane was delivered on January 12, 2011. The OPIS contract average for Geneva, NE on that day was 94.467. The contract bid for tank usage and delivery was 23.345 for every gallon delivered to the Center. The price paid to the contractor for every gallon delivered that day would be $1.1782 (94.467+23.345). If the contractor delivered 3,000 gallons that day the invoice from the contractor to USMARC would reflect a total due of $3,534.60 (3,000 x 1.1782(94.467+23.345)).<br />The contractor bid for this contract will be the delivery and usage charge based on a per gallon basis as described above. If you have any questions concerning the pricing mechanism please contact Donita Furman or Bucky Herman.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide a monthly statement to USMARC. All tanks are numbered and must have functioning gauges. The statement or invoice received from the contractor must include the date each tank was filled, the tank number, % full before filling, gallons input into the tank, and % full after filling.  Statements/invoices not providing this information for all gallons billed will be rejected. Payment will be made from that statement. Payment will be made via government purchase/Visa card.</p>
<p>Bid Form<br />_________ cents per gallon of propane delivered to USMARC as described in the bid document.<br />CCR and ORCA: Vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) and Online Representation and Certifications (ORCA) prior to the award of the contract. You may register by going to www.ccr.gov. You will need to your Tax ID, Duns Number, Bradstreet number and banking information.</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

<DESC>Post of duty is: 99 New York Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20226.
<p>YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUTE DAILY TO THE PERSONNEL SECURITY BRANCH OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, DC</p>
<p>Description<br />The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has an established Contract Background Investigation Program (CBIP) to conduct personnel security background investigations on prospective ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees. The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information. Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450, 12968, and 13467, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.</p>
<p>ATF's CBIP utilizes the services of experienced investigators to conduct investigative leads. However, ATF realizes there is a need to secure the services of persons possessing certain degrees of expertise in the processing of background investigations, including planning, scoping, assigning and reviewing. To that end, ATF has determined that the most efficient and cost-effective method of conducting such activities is to employ the services of contract investigators and therefore, has a need for "In-House Special Investigators," hereinafter referred to as contractors.</p>
<p>Operational and administration aspects of the program are contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations. Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.</p>
<p>Contract investigators who are under contract with ATF shall be known as "Special Investigators" and carry credentials authorizing them to perform such background investigations as the Assistant Director may authorize. Contractors may also be assigned to assist with other official ATF investigations.</p>
<p>The Office of Professional Responsibilities and Security Operations, Personnel Security Branch (PSB), shall monitor the conduct of all background investigators. The Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) and the contractor's responsibilities thereunder are subject to changes in Federal law, regulation and policy, which may include, but are not limited to procedural changes related to the use of government equipment, security procedures, and investigative priorities. All modifications may be sent to contractors via mail or electronic mail after review and approval of ATF Contracting Officer and Program Office.</p>
<p>Program Requirements<br />The PSB is currently organized into four (4) team sections. Applicant Team: responsible for conducting background investigations on potential ATF special agents, industry operations investigators, and other ATF personnel. Contactor Team: responsible for conducting background investigations on potential ATF contractors, task force officers, student interns, and volunteers. Employee Team: responsible for conducting periodic reinvestigations on current ATF employees. Investigations Team: responsible for organizing assignments, review and approval of background investigative leads sent to ATF Field Special Investigators. In addition, the Investigations Team provides guidance to Special Investigators in the field; they also serve as the authority for investigative coverage requirements.</p>
<p>Contractors must possess sufficient investigative, administrative and managerial abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them. Such tasks might include planning assignments, scoping investigations, assigning investigations, reviewing Reports of Investigation (ROI), auditing and adjudicating investigations, completing requests for payment and working on special projects as directed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), Branch Chief or designee. Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.</p>
<p>Standard In House Contractors<br />Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner. A minimum of 36 hours and 4 days per week is required. Contractors are responsible for providing adequate office coverage with their respective team; to include holiday and high vacation/travel months. Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the BPA. The minimum hour and days per week is subject to availability of Bureau funds and program office workload and can be altered at any time without prior notification.</p>
<p>On-Call In House Contractors<br />The ATF may have a need to hire on-call contractors. If investigative work and/or an increase in priority investigations create a backlog, contractors would be required to work on an as needed basis; two or three days a week, as determined by the PSB. On-call contractors will be contacted by the PSB when their services are required. Once the necessary work has been performed, contractors will be excused from their assignment as directed by the PSB. On-call contractors must adhere to the same standards and codes of conduct as Standard In House Contractors.</p>
<p>Payment for Services and Scheduling<br />In compliance with ATF's specific invoicing procedures, contractors must submit a request for payment detailing the number of hours worked. All claims for payment or reimbursement shall be subject to audit and adjustment.</p>
<p>Contractors will be paid at the rate of $56.00 per hour for each hour up to and including 40 hours or otherwise established rate as determined by ATF. Contractors shall not work more than ten hours per day without prior approval from the COTR, Branch Chief or designee. Hours authorized and worked in excess of 40 hours per week will be paid at the rate of $84.00; the need for additional work hours must be agreed upon and have prior approval from the COTR, Branch Chief or designee. Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner. A minimum of 36 hours and 4 days per week is required. Contractors are responsible for providing adequate office coverage with their respective team; to include holiday and high vacation/travel months. Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the BPA. The minimum hour and days per week is subject to availability of Bureau funds and program office workload and can be altered at any time without prior notification.</p>
<p>Contractors are afforded a 15-minute break for each 4-hour period worked; they shall not be compensated for breaks greater than 15 minutes. Contractors must claim a minimum of 15-minutes for lunch each day worked; they shall not be compensated for time taken for lunch. Contractors will not be compensated for parking fees and travel to and from work.</p>
<p>ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services. This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations. Consequently, contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract. Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF. The third party contractor also will provide means for each contractor to register, enroll, and review the status of account payments through an on-line system. Specific details of this arrangement will be provided to each contractor if and when the third party source is identified.</p>
<p>Performance and Access to ATF Materials and Information <br />Contractors are responsible for safeguarding information. Background investigation information is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and, unless classified, is Sensitive but Unclassified Information (SBU). SBU must not be transmitted via unsecured email or Internet, or disclosed to unauthorized parties. Contractors must never furnish or divulge SBU contained in an investigation. Each contractor must make every reasonable effort to protect data associated with a background investigation. Data, notes, copies of testimonies, copies of ROIs, etc., are the sole property of ATF and must be safeguarded against unlawful disclosure.</p>
<p>Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that reflects positively on ATF. To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired. Contractors must promote a positive workplace environment. Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance may be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the BPA being terminated. Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected. Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance.</p>
<p>Contractors will have access to ATF's computer network and are required to successfully complete a series of mandatory online training courses; some may require an annual recertification. Currently, the ATF requires all contractors to complete the following courses: Introduction to National Security Information, Information Security Awareness with Acknowledgement of the Rules of Behavior and Social Engineering, Emergency Preparedness, IS-700: FEMA - National Incident Management System and IS-100.LE - ICS 100 for Law Enforcement Personnel. Contractors must also complete the following forms: ATF P 7500.1 (Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users), and ATF F 1710.5 (Request for Media ID), Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Any identification media, ATF provided software, and all other Government property must be surrendered when requested by the PSB.</p>
<p>Contractors should never use ATF credentials for investigating any matter not assigned to them by ATF, the PSB or for any personal gain. Contractors must not allow their credentials to be photocopied or taken from their possession. Lost or stolen credentials should be reported to the PSB immediately, as well as the local police department.</p>
<p>Contractors, who wish to terminate their BPA with the ATF, prior to its expiration, must notify the PSB with a minimum 30 day written notice.</p>
<p>Security and/or Suitability Screening<br />Each contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and receive a Top Secret clearance. This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the PSB, and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish. A favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF information, information technology systems, and unescorted access to facilities.</p>
<p>Failure to timely complete the required background forms, have a background investigation favorably adjudicated or receive a Top Secret clearance constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor. The contractor is advised that this investigation may take 60 days or more to complete, depending upon the complexities of the issues. ATF will conduct a Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years. Should the contractor be disqualified, he or she will not be granted unescorted access to any ATF facility, and access to ATF proprietary information or data will not be authorized.</p>
<p>Contractors may be required to complete a Conduct and Integrity Certification and Agency Specific Qualification Certification prior to submitting a formal background investigation package. Failure to adhere to ATF's conduct and integrity guidelines and/or be in compliance with DOJ and ATF agency specific qualifications may result in immediate disqualification.</p>
<p>Central Contractor and Dun and Bradstreet Registration<br />Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. CCR requires that registrations must be recertified on an annual basis in order to remain active. The contractor is responsible for making changes to his/her own information. Any change to the contractor's name, address, telephone number, company name, tax identification number, or financial institution information must be made by the contractor in the CCR. It is vital contractors keep their registration current. In addition, contractors must notify the PSB and the ATF Financial Management Division of any changes so the proper updates can be made to all systems.</p>
<p>Contractor Certification<br />Each contractor must complete a Contractor Certification which declares that any submission of a contractor's request for payment and any supplemental material, whether submitted in hard copy or electronic format, represents actual hours worked and/or actual reported investigative work that was performed and conducted in compliance with requirements of the awarded BPA.</p>
<p>Facilities<br />ATF agrees to furnish the equipment and facilities to allow contractors to perform the duties expected of them. Post of Duty: 99 New York Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20226.</p>
<p>Deliverables<br />Contractor tasks will be assessed on a continuing basis. Tasks will be performed in a manner acceptable to the PSB and must be accomplished in accordance with personnel security guidelines and branch procedures.</p>
<p>Solicitation<br />ATF intends to issue vendors a BPA that will be available for placing calls/orders through November 1, 2016. The solicitation will close November 4, 2011. All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) vendors. A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably.</p>
<p>ATF reserves the right to retain all proposal materials for any vendor. As the needs of the CBIP change, the PSB has authority to reconsider proposals for those vendors who receive a favorable evaluation and review, but not initially selected for an award. However, because the needs of the program are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation and add new vendors to the selection pool.</p>
<p>Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA. A BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminate the need for more complex acquisition methods. There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor. Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative. The BPA and the contractor's responsibilities thereunder are subject changes in Federal law, regulation and policy, which may include, but are not limited to, procedural changes related to the use of government equipment, security procedures and investigative priorities. Modifications may be sent to vendors via mail or electronic mail. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.</p>
<p>The following clauses are incorporated in full force: FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror - Commercial Items (Oct. 00) and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference). Each offeror must be willing to submit a completed copy of the provisions set forth in FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.209-5, Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters and provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4. These three documents will be provided to the vendor, by the PSB, when and if a tentative offer for award is extended.</p>
<p>EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.<br />Capability of the Vendor.<br />ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor's acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate). All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration. These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply. Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability. Vendors rated as "passed" will be awarded points for past performance and experience. Vendors with an overall score of at least 68 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores. At least 56 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance and 12 must come from Vendor Capabilities.</p>
<p>A. Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance (80 Points): Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing. A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended. ATF will evaluate each vendor's experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency. ATF may assess the vendor's communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations. ATF may contact some of the vendor's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction. In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF. ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source. (56 points minimum).</p>
<p>B. Capabilities (20 Points): Capabilities are the vendor's ability to adhere to agency and program requirements. (12 points minimum).</p>
<p>Acceptability<br />ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a "pass" or "fail" basis. A vendor's offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any). If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable. Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.</p>

<p>The following clauses are incorporated into the solicitation in full text:</p>
<p>52.27-103-72 DOJ CONTRACTOR RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT BUREAU OF PRISONS (JUNE 2004)<br />For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:<br />1. Legally resided in the United States (U.S.);<br />2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or<br />3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.<br />If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S. The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm<br />By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.24-403-70 NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.</p>
<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. <br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br /><br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. <br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.</p>
<p>The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: <br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. <br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. <br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. <br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. <br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. <br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. <br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. <br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. <br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. <br />The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2. Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. <br />[End of Clause]</p>

WORK SCHEDULE: The services shall be scheduled during the weekday and provided from 8:00 am to 4:30 pm. The Podiatrist shall provide two full day clinics each month.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK: This procurement is a nonpersonal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance.

The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. Major Duties: Evaluation and treatment of patients in need of licensed Podiatry care.

The podiatrist provides services within their legal scope of practice and participates in coordination of care with other health care providers. The work may be complex, requiring consultation with other health care providers and specialists. The work requires simultaneous application of multiple knowledge, skills, and abilities in Podiatry medicine. SCOPE AND EFFECT: The purpose of the work is to provide Podiatry services, which directly affects the health and well being of individual patients, the patient's families, and impacts the health status of the entire community served.&ensp;The Podiatrist will work directly with local Northern Cheyenne Service Unit primary care providers to support continuity of care with their patients. PERSONAL CONTACTS: Personal contacts are with patients, families of patients, medical officers and other health professionals, other ancillary employees, administrators and healthcare providers from the private sector. PURPOSE OF CONTACTS: The purpose of contacts are to obtain and exchange health information, resolve problems, educate, influence, and motivate individuals and groups to understand and accept recommended medical information, diagnosis, and treatment. PHYSICAL DEMANDS: The work involves standing, bending and lifting patients throughout the work day. Handling needles and medication for injection also pose a risk for individual injury. Injuries could result from physically handling patients or with working with patients that may be emotionally disoriented.

The podiatrist may be subjected to adverse weather and hostile patients and/or their families.

This training must be completed annually by all employees including contractors, volunteers, students, and summer externs. The Contractor will be required to comply with the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, "Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors," and the associated Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementation guidance for personal identity verification for all affected contractor and subcontractor personnel.

Public Law (P.L.) 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act and P.L. 101-647, Crime Control Act of 1990, require the IHS to conduct a character and criminal history background investigation on all contractors performing services in IHS facilities. The Administrative Officer at the Service Unit will conduct the character and background investigations. Fingerprints must also be taken as part of the pre-employment process and must be completed before the podiatrist is allowed to work. The fingerprint check should be coordinated with the Administrative Officer. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. All IHS regulations and policies applicable to these Acts shall be enforced. The Contractor shall comply with IHS facility infection control and safety procedures, practices, and standards. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition. The FAR provision 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; and 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items are incorporated by reference.

This is a two-step design/build construction project for Design/Build Demolition Bldg. 200H at the Naval Station, Great Lakes, Illinois, Request for Proposals, #N40083-12-R-0001.  

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  It is the intent and objective of the Government to obtain design and construction services including labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision required to design/build project to remove the existing 16-story base hospital, including out buildings that are part of the hospital complex, and build back a site that is grassed and paved to match the surrounding street layout.
  The contractor shall design the site build back in accordance with the RFP requirements.  Bid drawing information shows the extent of the existing building and sitework.   New sitework includes earthwork to fill in the pit from the hospital removal and repair and repaving of adjacent streets, sidewalks and parking areas.  The hospital pad area shall be landscaped with grass and plants.  Existing trees shall be protected and maintained to the fullest extent possible.  Any trees removed shall be replaced in accordance with the RFP requirements.   Extensive hazardous material abatement is required.   The contractor shall prepare an abatement plan in accordance with the RFP documents.  They include a hazardous material report and drawings showing the location of known hazardous materials.
  Since the building was used as a hospital, there is also probable microbial abatement required at equipment such as fume hoods and lead contamination at some sink traps.   All surrounding buildings shall be protected from dust intrusion from the demolition.   Recycling of the non-hazardous building materials and equipment is required.

The existing hospital is a steel frame structure with concrete foundations, retaining walls and floor slabs on metal joists, a brick exterior enclosure wall with punched aluminum windows and a section of glazed curtainwall at the front entry.   The work includes demolition of out buildings consisting of a maintenance shop, a veterinary clinic building, a generator/fire-pump building, a kitchen exhaust building, an oxygen tank enclosure area, a bus shelter and a smoking shelter.
  Demolition work also includes removal of a flagpole and time capsule.  The building will be vacant during the work. Site demolition includes removal and re-routing of underground utilities around the site including removal of underground fuel tanks that serve the generators and a glycol snow melt system under the loading dock driveway.

The existing hospital has a full below grade basement that is open to loading docks on the East side.  A full kitchen and cafeteria and mechanical and storage rooms occupy most of the basement.  The basement has 3 concrete tunnels that connect to nearby structures.    Two of the tunnels lead to structures that are part of the hospital complex and are located on the same block.
 These are the kitchen exhaust building and the generator/ fire-pump building.  The third tunnel leads to a building across the street that is used as a laboratory.  This building has equipment that is sensitive to vibration and the tunnel connection needs to be severed prior to other demolition to minimize vibration transfer through the tunnel.   The opening where the tunnel attaches to the lab building will be closed in when the full tunnel is removed.  Demolition of the main structure needs to limit vibration to avoid interruption of the lab. 

The bottom 6 floors of the hospital contain general clinic spaces, pharmacy, surgery, central sterile, radiology, a chapel, offices, storage areas and the emergency rooms.
 The upper floors contain patient rooms and offices with some clinic areas mixed in.  The 3 top floors of the hospital house mechanical and electrical spaces, the building chillers and elevator equipment.   Original interior walls are plaster. Remodeled areas have gypsum board on steel studs. Radiology and surgery have lead lined walls and doors in some rooms.  Flooring is mostly VCT with some terrazzo and sheet vinyl. Some offices have carpet.  

The maintenance shop is a 2-story office structure with an attached high bay garage area with roll-up doors.  It is a brick and masonry structure with interior plaster and gypsum board walls. 

The veterinary clinic is a single story brick and masonry structure with an outside fenced kennel area.
 There is a surgery room and a lead lined xray room as well as exam rooms, offices, treatment and mechanical rooms.

The generator/fire pump building is a single story brick and masonry wall building with large louvers and hollow metal doors. The generators are to be removed and turned over to the owner.

All demolition shall be demolished by the mechanical method of demolition.  Explosives are prohibited.

The NAICS Code for this proposed procurement is The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this project is 562910 Environmental Remediation Services, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.<br /><br />GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the New Construction of a U. S. Courthouse in San Antonio, Texas.<br /><br />GSA will construct a new U. S. Courthouse to meet the needs of its various tenants: U. S. Courts, U. S. Marshals, U. S. Probation, U. S. Pretrial, and several other agencies. It will include the design and construction of a new, approximately 304,000 square foot Federal courthouse<br /><br />GSA generally allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs for new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions. The art budget for this New Courthouse project is currently estimated to be approximately $400,000.00. One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission<br /><br />Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artists Registry (Registry). The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions. Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture">www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</a> <br /><br />All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the New U. S. Courthouse in San Antonio, Texas, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 3:00 PM Eastern Time on December 9, 2011. Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry. Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline<br /><br />GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis. Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a price proposal for the contemplated project.. GSA has determined that the combined weight of all the technical selection criteria is significantly more important than price<br /><br />At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

<p>(3) The provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (May 2011) and Alternate 1 (Apr 2011) applies.</p>
<p>(4) The provision at FAR 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jun 2010) and below addendum applies.</p>
<p>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs. Certain SIPs may also mandate certain Contractors to operate under the terms of a compliance plan intended to reduce VOC emissions.</p>
<p>(b) Contractors, therefore, must submit the following to the<br />designated Port Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: <br />1) Copies of any federal, state or local permits required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places;<br />2) Copies of any compliance plans required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places.</p>
<p>(c) If no federal, state or local permits or compliance plans are required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite workplaces, then Contractor shall submit to the designated Port Engineer a letter, notarized under oath, that such documents are not required.<br />(d) Contractors will submit the following to the designated Port<br />Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: Data Sheets (MSDS) documents, certificates, specifications or any other manufacturing data verifying the VOC ratings of paints to be applied to the Cutter in accordance with MLCA Standard Spec 63000N, Section 5.3.1.</p>
<p>REQUIRED INSURANCE</p>
<p>The Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure and maintain the following kinds of insurance with respect to performance under the contract. In accordance with HSAR 3052.228-70, Insurance (DEC 2003), the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with proof of insurance for the duration of the contract, including:<br />1. Ship Repairer's Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />2. Comprehensive General Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />3. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the United States' Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />4. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the State's Workmen's Compensation Law (or its equivalent) for all places of performance under this contract.</p>
<p>The insurance certificate must provide the name of the US Coast Guard vessel and the contract and/or solicitation number as specifically insured.</p>
<p>INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>

<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC. <br />DISCOVERIES AND CHANGES TO CONTRACT:<br />Work requests can be transmitted electronically by using email. The bullets below display the process of how work requests are to be followed during an availability:</p>
<p>Work Request Process will occur in the following order:<br />1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COTR<br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COTR and provided to Contractor<br />3. Work Request- WR and IGE are generated by the COTR and forwarded to KO<br />4.

Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Work Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COTR by the KO<br />8. Modification to Contract- The KS/KO will issue a modification covering all WR's</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>

<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency has a requirement for Honeywell 4800isr handheld barcode readers. This is issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) # SP4707-12-Q-0006. Place of performance, inspection, acceptance and F.O.B. are at Destination, Battle Creek, Michigan. Delivery shall be no later than 30 calendar days after award date.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2005-53.</p>
<p>This acquisition is set-aside 100 percent for small business concerns, and the associated NAICS code is 334119 with a SBA size standard of 1000 in employment.<br /><br />Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote. Quotes with quantities of less than requested or products other than those requested specifically by brand name will be deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>CLIN Descriptions:</p>
<p>CLIN 001: Honeywell 4800Isr Handheld Barcode Scanner Kits with MH10<br />Conversion Formats Defaulted, 12 foot USB cable and 5 year Enhanced Warranty Protection. P/N(s): 4800ISR051C, 42206202-02. QTY: 310 ea.<br /><br /><br />Brand Name Justification Documentation: The Honeywell hardware is compatible with DAISY and will be used with RBI. The handhelds have been tested with DSS and are currently being used at the DDCs to support DSS, which will be used with RBI. The DSS System is configured to work with these scanners specifically. It is not possible to reconfigure DSS to use a different brand of scanner. Deviating from this brand would create support issues and possibly delay shipments. Only the Honeywell 4800 will ensure compatibility and interoperability with DSS. This compatibility will ensure interoperability between employees using DAISY and DSS, and in the future, RBI Solution. The devices can utilize the existing IT infrastructure at depots which are co-located with DRMS and will ensure the greatest hardware and software compatibility with the currently fielded baseline. This hardware and software combination will enable extensive interoperability among DLA resources.</p>
<p>Only new equipment is being solicited. Remanufactured or refurbished equipment, as defined in FAR 11.001, is technically unacceptable. Trade-in or exchange of old equipment is not available.</p>
<p>The evaluation factor(s) for award is; lowest-price, technically acceptable. Any resulting contract or order will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>Please place "SP4707-12-Q-0006" in the subject field of any e-mail correspondence. Questions regarding this RFQ are due by 10/21/2011 at 4:00 p.m. EST.

The Government will evaluate quotations for acceptability, without consideration of tradeoffs among cost and non-cost factors.  The factors and standards establishing the requirements of acceptability that meets or exceeds the Government technical specification are as follows:<br><br>Technical:  The Government will evaluate Offeror's proposal to the extent the technical solution, to include the proposed products, meets the government requirements. The Government will evaluate the offeror's certification that their product is equivalent or higher in quality and completely compatible and interchangeable with Herman Miller Action Office Systems product.<br>The Government will evaluate other relevant criteria, but NOT limited to:<br><br> 	Ability to deliver the requirements when and where required;<br> 	The proposed plan of approach and work schedule;<br> 	Quality of proposal including any innovative concepts;<br> 	Material swatches/samples and product literature/brochures;<br> 	Any other criteria set out in the RFQ or otherwise reasonably considered relevant.<br>Each Offeror quote will be evaluated on the technical capabilities/specifications/Salient Characteristics.  The degree to which the Offeror's technical quote demonstrates to the Government evaluators that the Offeror can provide the requested components, services/performance and related items in the Statement of Work (SOW).<br>These requested items are required to ensure cubicle workstation furnishings are consistent, compatible, and interchangeable with the other existing Herman Miller AO1 cubicle furnishing, without modification, in use throughout the entire three story building.

The Offeror's quotation will be evaluated to determine if prices for individual items are fair and reasonable.  The sum total of all CLINs will be used to determine the bottom-line evaluated price costs to complete this effort.  In evaluating the Price Factor, the Government will perform an evaluation to determine the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed prices in accordance with FAR 15.404-1 (b).  The Government is seeking the offerors price that meets or exceeds all requirements outlined in the SOW.<br><br>Acceptable: A quote is acceptable if it meets or exceeds minimum requirements in the solicitation.  <br><br>Unacceptable:  A quote will be deemed unacceptable if it does NOT meet or exceeds minimum requirements in the solicitation.  A lack of minimum content or failure to address all evaluated areas could render a quote unacceptable. <br><br>The award will be made on the basis of initial quotations without discussions (although the right to conduct discussions, if necessary, is reserved).

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">18 Oct 11:</span>&nbsp; IMPORTANT: Please notice that we posted a "NEW" FBO posting to issue our pre-solicitation notice.

The FORMAL RFP, anticipated to be released early Nov 2011, will be posted to that "new" pre-solicitation notice posting versus being posted here. Until that time, all "draft" documents will continue to be posted here. Only one more set of draft documents (Industry Day Q&amp;A and draft contract documents) will be posted here and that will occur later this week.<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">18 Oct 11:</span>&nbsp; The purpose of this RFI is to post the final draft version of the SOW, SRD, SEP and CDRLs.&nbsp; The SOW contains track changes so that you can review the specific changes that occurred&nbsp;since&nbsp;the document&nbsp;was last posted to FBO.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the remaining documents were not changed utilizing track changes.&nbsp; Please review these attached documents and provide any questions/comments NLT 4:00 pm (MST) on 24 Oct 11.&nbsp; The Industry Day Q&amp;A and the final draft RFP (contract related) documents are anticipated to be posted later this week.<br /><br />We appreciate your interest in our acquisition and applaud your patience in waiting for us to post documents.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3 Oct 11</span>: The purpose of this RFI is to post: (a) the resulting Q&amp;A on the initial draft RFP documents that were posted on FBO between 5 Aug and 9 Sep 2011; (b) the list of companies who participated in the 20-21 Sep Industry Day, (c) the Industry Day briefing with minor revisions such as the addition of the government technical team POC's and contact information, and (d) updated timeline the government will follow in posting revised "draft" documents to gain industry feedback before releasing the formal RFP.

<DESC><p>Background <br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS) Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) program is designed to promote the sustainability of the Medicare program by shifting Medicare beneficiaries' health care costs to private sources of payment, when available. The MSP law states that Medicare is prohibited from making payment where payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made by another insurer. In order to adhere to its statutory requirements, CMS' MSP program performs two primary functions: (1) coordinating benefits in order to ensure that Medicare pays properly, and (2) pursuing recoveries, where Medicare has paid conditionally and is entitled to reimbursement.&nbsp;<br /><br />CMS is seeking to establish a centralized Coordination of Benefits (COB) and Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery (MSPR) operation by consolidating under a single program, the performance of all activities that support the collection, management, and reporting of other insurance coverage of Medicare beneficiaries, and the collection of mistaken primary payments. These activities are currently being performed under two separate contracts. CMS intends to establish a centralized COB and MSPR operation that provides quality customer service and a single source to Medicare providers, suppliers, beneficiaries, insurers and other stakeholders by streamlining the MSP data and debt collection processes while ensuring the integrity of the Medicare Trust Funds.</p>
<p><br />Overall goals in this consolidation initiative are to:<br />&bull; Administer the MSP process more efficiently and effectively by providing a single contractor entity to operate, coordinate and maintain the MSP process and thus generate cost savings through a reduction in mistaken primary Medicare payments and identification of conditional Medicare payments.<br />&bull; Provide beneficiaries and their representatives with a more efficient, user friendly and less intrusive MSP identification and debt recovery operation by streamlining the process from the collection of MSP information through to the collection of debt. <br />&bull; Achieve other cost reductions and management efficiencies by consolidating performance of similar activities (e.g., mail-room activities, Customer Service / Help Desk activities, etc.) that are necessary to carry out daily operations.<br />&bull; Provide greater flexibility in contracting to ensure the best earned value for the government. <br />&bull; Enhance program integrity consistent with the objectives of the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP).</p>
<p><br />THE DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK IS ISSUED FOR COMMENTS ONLY. NO RESPONSES TO COMMENTS WILL BE GIVEN. NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED.</p>
<p>PLEASE SUBMIT COMMENTS AS AN ATTACHMENT TO THE E-MAIL.</p>
<p><strong>CMS anticipates releasing a&nbsp;solicitation on or about November 16, 2011.&nbsp; It is anticipated that this solicitation will result in the award of a base year and four one-year options</strong>. &nbsp;</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER N68335-12-R-0009.</strong>
<p>&nbsp;The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Lakehurst, NJ, intends to competitively procure the A/F27T-12 Hydraulic Component Test Stand (HCTS) for use at all land based Fleet Readiness Centers (FRC), "L" Class, CVN ships and at the Marine Mobile Maintenance Facilities (MMF) based Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Departments (AIMDs). The HCTS provides hydraulic, electrical and pneumatic power, instrumentation and controls necessary for diagnostic testing and functional acceptance testing of repaired aircraft hydraulic and pneumatic components. The legacy HCTS is nearing the end of its useful service life and the following describes the requirements for a replacement.</p>
<p>The replacement HCTS shall be a manually operated test stand (e.g. hand turned valves for pressure &amp; flow, numerical push buttons for temperature) with general programmable automated cyclic setting features. However, it is not the intention of the Navy for the HCTS to have pre-programmed Unit Under Test (UUT) automatic test programs to test and evaluate specific aircraft components. If any setting is automatically set the HCTS will have a manually operated redundant control.</p>
<p>The requirements of the Navy shall be met by a modular design that allows configuration of the HCTS to change by the adding of a separate console or system in order to meet the testing or operational requirements of the activity. The HCTS shall comprise of the following modules: Main Hydraulic Console (MHC) (all activities), Pump and Motor Test Console (P&amp;MTC) (selected land based activities) and Hydraulic Fluid Cooling System (HFCS) (USMC Maintenance facilities).</p>
<p>Nominal requirements for the replacement test stand are:</p>
<p>Two independent Dynamic Test Circuits capability: 30 gpm at 6,000 psig, 40 gpm at 5,000 psig, 60 gpm at 3,000 psig (all max) with full back pressure control; Low Pressure Test Circuit: 0-250 psi; Hydraulic Static Pressure Circuit: Maximum hydrostatic pressure of 10,000 psig; Pneumatic Static Pressure Circuit: Max pneumatic static pressure of 6,000 psig; Pump and Motor Capability (separate module): Able to interface/run a pump and/or motor in an additional chamber driving hydraulic pumps from 0 to 10,000 RPM, 300 horsepower, measure and display output torque of hydraulic motors in the range of 0 to 2500 in-lbs.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Common Support Equipment (CSE) program is to satisfy this operational need by procuring a commercially built component test stand, which may require modifications to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the contract will be a fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a minimum quantity of three (3) each Main Hydraulic Console (MHC) pilot production units (PPU), one (1) each Pump and Motor Test Console (PMTC) PPU, and one (1) each Hydraulic Fluid Cooling System (HFCS) PPU to be purchased with the first Delivery Order, along with associated technical and logistics data and training. After successful completion of contractor pilot production testing and government suitability and supportability evaluation, the government&nbsp;intends to issue delivery orders over four (4) production years for up to (80) Main Hydraulic Console production units, up to(16) Pump and Motor Test Console production units, and up to (22) Hydraulic Fluid Cooling System production units, as well as additional logistics and technical support elements.</p>
<p><strong>THIS SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER N68335-12-R-0009.</strong></p>

SCOPE<br>This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for procuring, documenting, and delivering Virtual Patient System (VPS) Tetherless Mannequins that are required to enhance the medical training capability that currently exists at the Medical Simulation Training Centers (MSTCs).  This procurement includes all items listed in VPS Tetherless Mannequin Equipment List found in Appendix B at the end of this SOW.<br><br>1.1.	BACKGROUND<br><br>The Medical Simulation Training Centers (MSTCs) are standardized Army training assets located at various military installations worldwide, delivering effective medical training with a standardized training platform to better prepare Soldiers to apply medical interventions under combat conditions.  The MSTC provides medical training and education on new battlefield procedures and equipment, while affording Soldiers the ability to receive comprehensive training in several formats such as the classroom setting, practical hands-on training simulation, trauma lanes, and distance learning.<br>Each MSTC configuration consists of a Virtual Patient System (VPS) that contains all of the MSTC training devices and critical technologies.  Training devices include but are not limited to, patient mannequins, dead-weighted mannequins, airway management mannequins, and various part task trainers.<br>Most of the MSTC training devices Soldier scenarios emphasize the need to diagnose and stabilize a wounded Soldier within the first ten (10) minutes after injury for bleeding, a compromised airway, or lung injury.  Based on the consistent occurrences of highly traumatic injuries in the combat environment, Soldiers must be trained to quickly stop the bleeding and become accustomed to performing in various horrific scenarios.<br>The Tetherless Mannequin requirements contained in this SOW will technically and psychologically prepare the Soldier to treat wounds in the combat environment.  <br>2.

<DESC>The New Orleans District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (MVN) is hosting a Debris Industry Forum on November 2, 2011. <br /><br />Purpose: The purpose of this Debris Forum is to discuss lessons learned, solicit feedback from industry on proposed changes to the Advanced Contracting Initiative (ACI) Debris Contracts, and demonstrate new technology to improve our response to future disasters. The forum will give interested vendors an opportunity to improve the acquisition process, and provide up-to-date information on the upcoming solicitation. This forum will be held at the New Orleans Marriott, 555 Canal Street, New Orleans, LA 70130-2300, Acadia Room. The General Session will be from 10:00 am to 11:30 am in the Acadia Room.&nbsp; Companies may arrive as early as 9:00 am for networking purposes.&nbsp;To register go to the following web site: http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/ebs/debris/index.asp. <br /><br />Background: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is authorized to respond to disasters under public law 93-288, Robert T. Stafford Act. The National Response Framework (NRF) identifies lead and supporting agencies, roles and responsibilities for responding to incidents of National Significance. The NRF identifies joint leadership roles between the Department of Defense (DoD) and FEMA for executing the Emergency Support Function (ESF) #3, Public Works and Engineering. FEMA issues mission assignments to DoD who in-turn delegates ESF #3 mission execution to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Existing Contracts: In order to execute ESF #3, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers implemented the Advance Contract Initiative (ACI). There are ACI contracts for ice, water, power, debris, and roofing. MVN is the lead District for the existing ACI Debris contracts. Presently, there are ten (10) Regions and three (3) MATOC Pools. <br /><br />Upcoming Re-Competition: The existing contracts are entering their final contract year. MVN will issue a solicitation for new ACI contracts in the near future. If you are interested in attending this forum, you must pre-register with the web site listed above. Space is limited and we will be accepting interested firms on a first come, first serve basis. You must register before October 26, 2011 to attend this forum. <br /><br />Special Note: In addition to attending the industry day, all interested companies are invited to submit a Capability Statement consisting of appropriate documentation, literature and brochures and should include: 1) Firm name, address, telephone and fax numbers. 2) Identification of the company as a Small Business with proper certification (NAICS Code 562119 business size standard is not to exceed $11,500,000). 3) Past experience with debris removal operations. 4) Letter from bonding agency indicating your performance and payment bond capacity. (5) List of existing teaming agreements in place with other businesses.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: Responses must be limited to no more than 10 pages. Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Corps in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation. Statements that do not meet all requirements or submitted within the allotted time will not be considered. Electronic submissions will be accepted. The responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis may be e-mailed to the POC listed for this special notice. Responses must be received no later than 4:30pm Central, Friday, November 4, 2011.<br /><br />NOTE: Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity. Information on registration may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov. Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet. Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please contact the individuals listed below: <br /><br />Gayle Rouse at 504-862-1547 Gayle.E.Rouse@usace.army.mil or <br />Tim Black at 504-862-2918 or <a href="mailto:Timothy.Black@usace.army.mil">Timothy.Black@usace.army.mil</a> <br /><br />

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking small business sources for a construction project entitled: Lower Granite Trash Shear Boom Repair. The work is located at the Lower Granite Lock and Dam located in Garfield County, Washington. This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract. Construction magnitude is between $500,000 and $1,000,000, and 100% performance and payment bonds will be required. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $33,500,000. <br /><br />This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify businesses with the capability to accomplish the work. This is not a solicitation. Only those firms who respond to this announcement by submitting the following information will be used in determining whether to set aside this requirement. <br /><br />1) A list of current or past projects demonstrating technical experience with work of a similar nature to that listed in the Summary Scope of Work. For each project submitted, provide a brief narrative statement of the work involved, your firm's role in the project, the dollar value and the completion date.<br /><br />2) A reference list for each of the projects submitted in #1 above.

Your response to this notice must be received on or before 3:00PM on October 24, 2011.<br /><br />Summary of Scope of Work:<br /><br />General: The Lower Granite Trash Shear Boom is a floating structure in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam that was designed to direct floating trash and debris away from the powerhouse turbine intakes. The boom consists of 5 spans held in position by four intermediate floats. Each intermediate float is held in place by two anchors-one on the upstream side and one on the downstream side, with a chain/wire rope/hardware system linking the anchors to the intermediate float.<br /><br />Current Conditions: The condition of the Trash Shear Boom Anchorage System is a concern because some existing wire ropes have broken and had to be replaced temporarily with poly ropes tied off to the existing shore anchors. One of the upstream anchor lines that had broken previously was replaced in the winter of 2006-2007. It is anticipated that anchor and anchor line should be in good condition for another 20 to 25 years. This scope of this contract will be to replace the remaining seven anchors/anchor line systems that are still original equipment or are presently tied off to shore anchors. If the trash boom were to come loose from its anchorage, it could end up lodged in either the Spillway Weir surface passage or the turbine intakes.<br /><br />Construction Contract: Using government furnished property-10,000 to 18,000 pound stockless anchors, wire rope, chain, and miscellaneous hardware-assemble the anchorage lines and set the anchors in the river bottom, and connect anchorage lines to the existing intermediate floats to hold the trash shear boom in place.<br /><br />Additional tasks for this contract include:<br />1. Using government furnished property, install three upstream and four downstream anchors, anchor lines, and hardware to keep the floating trash shear boom in position in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam. <br />2. Shorten the first span of longitudinal wire rope cable to approximately 10-20 feet.<br />3. Remove existing and install new (GFP or contractor provided?) backstrap.<br />4. Re-install chain from trash shear boom floats to the 2-inch mainline.<br />5. Inspect boat access and replace wire rope cables from the frame to the floats.<br />6. Inspect 2-inch main line on entire trash shear boom.<br /><br />The contract activities will require support of a barge mounted crane, a dive tender, and various work boats and/or barges. Shore crews shall assemble the anchorage lines onshore for installation by marine crews. Many of the tasks must be performed or supported by dive crews. Most dives will be in the range from the water surface to depths of 20 feet, but a few deep dives up to 120 foot depths will be required. Construction is restricted to the Snake River in-water work window (January 1 through March 1, 2012) and will most likely take place in inclement weather. Safety will be a concern with crane lifts of heavy items; icy conditions; work over water; and work in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam upstream of turbine intakes, conventional spillway gates, and the Spillway Weir surface passage.<br /><br />Additionally, the contractor will be required to provide a Project Superintendent, Quality Control Manager, and Site Safety and Health Officer. The Project Superintendent will not be allowed to perform the duties of either the Quality Control Manager or the Site Safety and Health Officer. However, one person could perform the duties of both the Quality Control Manager and the Site Safety and Health Officer. The person/persons assigned to those positions must meet the following requirements:<br /><br />Quality Control Manager-<br />1. A minimum of 5 years experience on similar projects requiring over-water work.<br />2. Completion of the "Construction Quality Management for Contractors" course within the last 5 years.<br /><br />Site Safety and Health Officer-<br /><br />1. A minimum of 5 years safety work experience on similar projects. <br />2. Completion of the 30-hour OSHA construction safety class or equivalent within the last 5 years.<br />3. Completion of an average of at least 24 hours of formal safety training each year for the past 5 years.<br />4. Competent person training as needed<br />
