<SUBJECT>Pediatric Anesthesia Neuro-Development Assessment (PANDA) Study
<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-201010036C
<CONTACT>Terry Frederick, Email terry.frederick@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), intends to award a modification to contract HHSF223200810036C and increase the current capacity by an estimated additional $249,000. The prospective contract action will thereby increase the overall contract value to an estimated $657,000. This contract was originally awarded to Columbia University under full-and-open competitive procedures.
<p><br />The Government intends to award the modification to this contract consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy requirement. Due to the vast institutional knowledge which Columbia University has gained throughout the development of the Pediatric Anesthesia and Neuro-Development Assessment (PANDA) Study over the past two years, its uniquely talented and dedicated personnel, as well as its comprehensive resources (i.e., information technology infrastructure; neuro-developmental assessment and neuropsychological testing abilities), Columbia University is uniquely suited to complete the subject activities.</p>
<p><br />Thus so far, Columbia University has completed, or is otherwise in the process of completing, each of the following tasks under contract:</p>
<p>* Participated in FDA's Safety of Key Inhaled and Intravenous Drugs in Pediatrics (SAFEKIDS) Initiative scientific workshops.<br />* Identified an appropriate study sample size that will allow for demonstration of a clinically and statistically significant effect with scientifically appropriate power.<br />* Published the findings of studies conducted under contract in peer-reviewed, scientific journals.<br />* Identified children who were exposed to general anesthesia within the first three years of life.<br />* Determined the study eligibility criteria.<br />* Developed methods to quantify anesthesia exposure.<br />* Obtained a complete medical history (with appropriate consent), including significant perinatal events and social history.<br />* Established an infrastructure for database management.<br />* Within the study population, documented the dose, types and use duration of all anesthetic agents, including but not limited to, agents that exhibit GABA agonists/NMDA antagonist properties, opioids and other hypnotics.</p>
<p><br />In furtherance and support of the PANDA Study, and in accordance with the proposed modification, it is expected that Columbia University shall complete the following activities:</p>
<p>* Initiate new clinical sites to recruit, enroll, and study subjects to help facilitate the timely completion of the PANDA Study; <br />* Coordinate the feasibility phase of the PANDA Study amongst US sites; and <br />* Perform study assessment for eligible subjects at sites other than the coordinating site to provide a better understanding for the feasibility and associated time line of the full trial.</p>
<p><br />Any other entity would incur substantial start-up costs and a significant amount of time in order to obtain the requisite resources and specialized knowledge required to successfully complete all work required under the subject requirement. Furthermore, with the public health at stake, there remains a pressing need to foster current progress and limit undue risk of project failure. There from, it is hereby determined that the subject services may not be competed without undue delay, duplication of previous efforts, and substantial duplication of cost.</p>
<p><br />The Government will support the proposed actions by written justification, as well as obtain all requisite approvals. The Government will post the respective justification on www.fbo.gov. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p><br />Capability Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed five (5) pages in length. Written inquiries may be directed to Terry Frederick at Terry.Frederick@fda.hhs.gov.</p>

Due to the vast institutional knowledge which the International Anesthesia Research Society has gained throughout the development of the FDA's Safety of Key Inhaled and Intravenous Drugs in Pediatrics (SAFEKIDS) Initiative over the past two years and its progress examining the effects of general anesthesia during the first year of life on chronic cognitive development, its uniquely talented and dedicated personnel, as well as its comprehensive resources and established relationships throughout the scientific community, the International Anesthesia Research Society is uniquely suited to complete the subject activities.</p>
<p><br />Thus so far, the International Anesthesia Research Society has completed, or is otherwise in the process of completing, each of the following tasks under contract:</p>
<p>* Participated in FDA's SAFEKIDS Initiative scientific workshops <br />* Identified an appropriate study sample size that will allow for demonstration of a clinically and statistically significant effect with scientifically appropriate power<br />* Presented reports required under contract<br />* Participated in at least one workshop related to the SAFEKIDS Initiative in the Maryland/Greater Washington, DC area<br />* Published the findings of studies in peer-reviewed scientific journals.</p>
<p><br />In furtherance and support of the SAFEKIDS Initiative, and in accordance with the proposed modification, it is expected that the International Anesthesia Research Society shall complete the following activities:</p>
<p>* Continue pre-existing work in furtherance of the SAFEKIDS Initiative<br />* Complete the initial phase of the administrative infrastructure for the multi-phased public-private partnership (PPP) to sustain the SAFEKIDS PPP; and</p>
<p><br />Any other entity would incur substantial start-up costs and a significant amount of time in order to obtain the requisite resources and specialized knowledge required to successfully complete all work required under the subject requirement. Furthermore, with the public health at stake, there remains a pressing need to foster current progress and limit undue risk of project failure. There from, it is hereby determined that the subject services may not be competed without undue delay, duplication of previous efforts, and substantial duplication of cost.</p>
<p><br />The Government will support the proposed actions by written justification, as well as obtain all requisite approvals. The Government will post the respective justification on www.fbo.gov. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p><br />Capability Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed five (5) pages in length. Written inquiries may be directed to Terry Frederick at Terry.Frederick@fda.hhs.gov.</p>

Please note the following:<br /><br />1) The Statement of Work (SOW) is CLASSIFIED - SECRET, and shall be provided under separate cover. <br /><br />2) This effort is in support of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) System Operational Assessment Program. Said program is an independent assessment program of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to evaluate the operational effectiveness of the worldwide NC3 System of the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NC3 System Operational Assessment Program is a unique program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no equivalent in government or private industry.<br /><br />The contractor shall be responsible to design, develop, and conduct recurring operational assessments to assist in the determining, in a quantitative manner, the operational capabilities of the Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (C3) System. This system supports the President and the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, and Combatant Commanders' decision making across the spectrum of conflict and threat environments. Included in the Nuclear C3 System are the Survivable Mobile Command and Control Centers consisting of airborne resources, selected fixed and mobile ground command centers, the strategic and non-strategic (theater) nuclear forces, and surviving command elements (including shipboard) of the nuclear and non-nuclear Combatant Commanders, the military services, and the DoD agencies as defined in the Emergency Action Procedures of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (EAP-CJCS Volumes VI and VII) and the National Military Command System/Department of Defense Emergency Communications Plan (NMCS/DoD Emergency Communication Plan). The objectives of the assessments are to identify deficiencies in equipment, both hardware and software, and procedures and to recommend corrective action to improve the operational capability. The minimum clearance required for access will be SECRET. Personnel who work with test development and/or test data results and analysis shall require TOP SECRET clearances and be eligible for Special Clearance Investigation for SCI access upon award of contract.Due to the range of services to be supported under the contract, and the rapidly changing nature of R&amp;D, the Government encourages the contractor to team or sub-contract with companies that provide new and innovative services. Due to the range of services to be supported under the contract, and the rapidly changing nature of R&amp;D, the Government encourages the contractor to team or sub-contract with companies that provide new and innovative services.<br /><br />3) The Government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type contract in support of this effort.<br /><br />4) Interested offerors shall view the attached solicitation document, HC1047-10-R-4009. Upon reviewing the document in its entirety to include any/all relevant unclassified attachments also provided under this solicitation, interested offerors shall take the following steps:<br /><br />a. Contact the Contracting Officer via email, in accordance with Section L of the solicitation, by 11:59 ET, 08 August 2010. Requests received after this date/time will not be considered.<br /><br />Please note&nbsp;a&nbsp;SECRET clearance (minimum) is required to receive, store, and generate, classified information pertaining to this acquisition. The classified&nbsp;SOW is attachment 1 to the solicitation. The National Industrial Security Program (NISP) and the&nbsp;2006 NISP Operating Manual (NISPOM) prescribes requirements, restrictions, and other safeguards that are necessary to prevent unauthorized disclosure of classified information and to control authorized disclosure of classified information released by U.S. Government Executive Branch Departments and Agencies to their contractors. The Manual also prescribes requirements, restrictions, and other safeguards that are necessary to protect special classes of classified information, including Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, intelligence sources and methods information, Sensitive Compartmented Information, and Special Access Program information. These procedures are applicable to licensees, grantees, and certificate holders to the extent legally and practically possible within the constraints of applicable law and the Code of Federal Regulations. Commercial entities that are in receipt of this government solicitation and wish to submit a competitive proposal to the government can obtain the associated classified information by providing a statement of compliance with the terms and conditions of the&nbsp;2006 NISPOM.<br /><br />A company that is foreign owned and cleared under a Special Security Arrangement (SSA) and its cleared employees may only be afforded access to prescribed information with special authorization. This special authorization must be manifested by a favorable national interest determination (NID) that must be program/project/contract-specific, thus a company operating under a current SSA doesn't automatically afford them access to GE program information. Access to proscribed information is predicated on compelling evidence that release of such information to a company cleared under the SSA arrangement advances the national security interest of the United States. All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered. Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (http://www.ccr.gov) to be considered for award of a contract. <br /><br />b. The Contracting Officer shall notify your firm's designated POC by 11:59 ET, 25 August 2010 if your firm has been approved/authorized to view the classified documents associated with this solicitation. You will also be notified by this date/time if your request has been rejected.<br /><br />c.&nbsp;The Government anticipates that appointments will be&nbsp;scheduled with all approved/authorized firms to view the classified documents in late August or early September 2010. An amendment to this solicitation will be issued establishing a formal proposal due date at that time.</p>
