AHRQ’s mission is to improve the safety, quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of healthcare for all Americans. To accomplish this goal, the Agency regularly sponsors a variety of different meetings to facilitate its work; seek input on research priorities and other key needs as seen by stakeholders, such as clinicians, policymakers, and others; and convey AHRQ research findings, products, and tools to a variety of audiences. The primary purpose of this meeting is to highlight AHRQ's achievements in improving healthcare for all Americans. In showcasing the best work AHRQ has to offer, it is  AHRQ’s goal to promote synergies between AHRQ’s work, our stakeholders, and the public to achieve greater quality healthcare. 

The National Advisory Council for Healthcare Research and Quality (NAC) was established in accordance with Section 921 (now Section 931) of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.c. 299 c). In accordance with its statutory mandate, the Council is to advise the Secretary of the Department of Health and Humans Services and the Director, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), on matters related to actions of the Agency to enhance the quality, improve the outcomes, reduce the costs of health care services, improve access to such series through scientific research and promote improvements in clinical practice and in the organization, financing, and delivery of health care services.  The Council is composed of a wide variety of individuals and organizations that provide unparalleled guidance and expertise in helping AHRQ shape its goals and priorities. In addition, a portion of the meeting is devoted to comments from the public to solicit input and comments to help shape the AHRQ research agenda. 

In support of these activities, AHRQ is soliciting for a contractor to provide technical, logistical, analytical and, administrative support services for the AHRQ annual meeting and the NAC.  It is anticipated that 1 contract will be awarded for a base period of 1 year with 4 one year options.  Award is expected on or about March 31, 2011.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments.  All responsible Service-Disabled Veteran-owned (SDVOSB) firms may submit a proposal which will be evaluated by AHRQ.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PORVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<br /><br />The project is funded in total through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.&nbsp; This is not a request for quotation/proposal/bid.</p>
<span>
<p>The proposed action will be a new firm fixed price task order issued against base Federal Supply Schedule contract GS-35F-0615S under Special Item Number (SIN) 132-62, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 Product and Service Components, as this includes the exact scope of work required for the project.&nbsp; The contractor is XTEC, Incorporated, 5775 Blue Lagoon Dr, Ste 280, Miami, FL 33126.&nbsp; The Product Service Code is 5962.&nbsp; The North American Industrial Classification Code is 334413 and the size standard is 500 employees.&nbsp; Work will be performed at the John F. Kennedy and Thomas P. O'Neill Federal Buildings in Boson , Massachusetts.&nbsp;<br /><br />The contractor will upgrade the existing security systems at the John F. Kennedy and Thomas P. O'Neill Federal Buildings in Boston, Massachusetts by designing, delivering and installing the following: upgrade of the backbone infrastructure for the existing GSA Region 1 Authentx Physical Access Control System (PACS) operating at both facilities to meet the infrastructure requirements of the GSA OCIO. The existing inbound/outbound garage, half circle steel reader mounts at both facilities will be replaced. Upgrade to the next generation of Authentx Xnodes components will be accomplished for increased programming upgrade capabilities to each end reader device located at both facilities. GSA controlled doors will be installed in the O'Neill Federal Building with FIPS-201 compliant FAS APL Authentx 10000 reader(s) to include revised programming on the Authentx PACS Global Network.<br /><br />The contractor will maintain the PACS hardware and software for a period of two years following the acceptance of the system upgrade by GSA. The contactor will have a Regional Office City service response team to respond to security system issues to meet the maintenance and emergency response requirements. This maintenance will include (1) preventive maintenance actions that, at a minimum, include those specified and/or recommended by the equipment manufacturers, (2) the installation of manufacturer recommended field hardware changes, (3) the installation of PACS application software patches, updates and new revisions, (4) the installation of GSA-mandated security software updates (if necessary), and (5) the repair/replacement of failed equipment components.<br /><br />This procurement will be awarded restricting competition of schedule contractors to fewer than required in FAR part 8.405-2 as it will be issued as a logical follow-on. The new order will be a follow-on to ITSS order R1JA47520703 that was competed on e-Buy under Schedule 70, Special Item Number (SIN) 132-62 and awarded to XTEC Incorporated on September 28, 2007 under schedule number GS-35F-0615S. In the new order the contractor will upgrade the existing security system that it put in place under R1JA47520703. Market research indicates no other schedule contractor will bid on this effort.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for engineering/technical expertise and system engineering modifications for the ASDE-X surveillance system. The ASDE-X system is technically unlike any other commercial surveillance system in production and includes proprietary hardware/software components that cannot be modified by the FAA.
This contract will provide engineering phone support, technical interchange meetings (TIMs), technical support at ASDE-X sites, engineering studies, and modification development.  The purpose is to sustain ASDE-X service and/or redundancy of the ASDE-X service in the NAS.  The ASDE-X program goal is to provide engineering services for the development of future (and presently unforeseen) ASDE-X system modifications.
Sensis Corporation, East Syracuse, NY, developed and produced the ASDE-X surveillance system and retains proprietary control of critical components in the ASDE-X subsystem.  An Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract for one year with options to renew for four additional 1-year periods is contemplated.  
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Sensis Corporation, East Syracuse, NY, in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<DESC>This procurement is restricted to Service Disable Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms located within a 500 mile radius of the VA Illiana Health Care System Medical Center, 1900 East Main Street, Danville, IL 61832-5100.  This requirement is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Applicable NAICS code is 541310 and small business size standard of $4.5 Million. 

Description of work to be performed includes: Architect-Engineering services are required for Schematics, Design Development, Construction Documents, Technical Specifications, Construction Period Services, Site Visits, Cost Estimates, and all other related information for Project #550-315, Construct Four (4) Small House Model Homes.  The project will include design work for the preparation of 100% complete working drawings and contract documents using edited VA Master Specifications to complete the following: 
Provide for the construction of four (4) "Small House Model" homes to house 10 veterans each.

These homes will provide hearth area combining the living room, dining room and open kitchen; dining room with a table that seats all long-term residence, the staff and two guests; private bedrooms, each with a bathroom and locked medicine cabinet; ceiling lifts; fenced outdoor space with two-door access for wandering; visual sight lines from the kitchen to the majority of the hearth area, bedrooms and outdoor space. These homes will be built with "green" principles.  The physical space is not meant to be "homelike", but to be a home. The concept and structure of these homes achieves better resident outcomes through a dramatically new way of organizing the care and the life of long-term residents in need of this care. The small scale of the home will maximize the functional capacity of our veterans due to the reduced environment and freedom from institutional routines.

"	All necessary mechanical spaces and telephone closets.

<DESC>The purpose of this posting is to provide a revised notice to Pre-Solicitation Notice Number W900KK-10-R-0004, dated 2 July 2010, for the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentations (PEO STRI) Synthetic Environment (SE) Core Common Virtual Environment (CVE) Management Program.  Additionally, the former pre-solicitation number W900KK-10-R-0004 has been changed to W900KK-11-R-0002. The SE Core CVE Management Solicitation W900KK-11-R-0002 was posted on Army Single Face Industry (ASFI) on 19 October 2010 and can be accessed via the following link: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/solicitation_search_form.cfm .<BR><BR> The SE Core CVE Management effort focuses on delivering software and limited hardware to enable an interoperable CVE for training of the Warfighters. The ultimate objective of SE Core is to facilitate a virtual training environment supporting mission focused unit training that approximates the changing contemporary operational environment. <BR><BR>Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), Army Training Strategies, Army Modernization Programs, Joint/Army Training Doctrine, Joint/Army Battle Command Training Support, and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) require a fully integrated LVC Training Environment (TE). The SE Core program is the Armys virtual component of the LVC TE. SE Core will develop and sustain the Armys CVE which links current and future virtual simulation devices into an interoperable full spectrum training capability. The CVE will connect to gaming training enablers and the live and constructive environments for an integrated LVC TE capability. <BR><BR>As the Army transitions to a campaign-quality Army with a Joint and expeditionary mindset, our Soldiers require relevant, on demand training available anywhere, anytime, and tailored to their operational training requirements. SE Core is comprised of complementary efforts for developing the CVE that facilitates fair fight interoperability for virtual system and non-system Training Aids Devices Simulators and Simulations (TADSS). The program develops operational training terrain databases, models, and simulation architecture connectivity to meet Warfighter operational training requirements. The terrain and model development efforts provide non-proprietary, open format, and image generator independent CVE deliverables. The simulation architecture provides an integrated training network. These efforts, linking current and future virtual training devices/simulations, enables the Army to execute combined arms and joint training, as well as mission planning and rehearsals at home station and at deployed locations. <BR><BR>Since SE Cores system development and demonstration phase, requirements for training and SE Core have grown. SE Core will continue to produce terrain databases, common moving models, the virtual simulation architecture, changes to OneSAF, and common virtual components such as but not limited to After Action Review, Interoperability Gateway, Scenario Generation Tool, and C4I Adapter. New requirements include but are not limited to: CVE capability management for system and non-system TADSS, mission planning and rehearsal visualization capability, acquisition of terrain source data, development of database centers, SE Core to TADSS plug-in expansion, sound and smell representation, semi-automated forces development and integration, exercise preparation and execution capabilities and definitions for the terms interoperability and fair fight. SE Core will also facilitate integration and updates concerning OneSAF and SE Core version releases into system and non-system virtual TADSS. <BR><BR>The SE Core CVE Management competition will be conducted on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis with best-value tradeoff evaluation procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 541512. The small business size standard is $25M (this is only applicable to small business Offerors who wish to participate in this full and open competition). The SE Core CVE Management solicitation will result in a five year, single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract. <BR><BR>The proposal should be based on the program of record anticipated funding identified herein. <BR><BR>To assist in determination of appropriate allocation across Statements of Work, the following is provided: Top priorities are Transition Phase-In and Production related CLINS. Next priorities are Program Management and Systems Engineering CLINS. Final priorities are those CLINs related to tool and CVE Development and Maintenance (maintenance only due to current fiscal constraints). <BR><BR>Offerors are advised that, based on the priority of this program to the Army, and historical precedence, this Program of Record level of funding will likely increase with the addition of Customer Funding and adjustments to the Program of Record budget .

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: 		OS18132
Intended Source:  		Congressional Quarterly Inc.
Period of Performance:  	One (1) Year, September 30, 2009-September 29, 2010

The Program Support Center (PSC), Strategic Acquisition Services (SAS), on behalf of the Office of Budget within the OS Asst. Secretary for Resources and Technology (ASRT), intends to award a 12 month sole source contract for a Congressional Quarterly Service Package,using simplified acquisition procedures to:

Congressional Quarterly Inc.
1255 22nd Street, NW
Washington, DC 20037

The congressional Quarterly Service Package provides the office with information from Capitol Hill summarizing and analyzing relevant budget and appropriations bills and reports scheduled for floor action; tracking of draft bills, amendments, schedules and other important events.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b) – which states that for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. 

Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within four (4) days after the date of publication of this notice. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation is available.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note 2: Glass break detection was chosen because of this building being a 24/7 site and alarm system armed for after hours, preventing false alarms. If it is determined that motion detection can be used in place of some glass breaks, then a dual tech type unit may be used, such as C&amp;K DT660STC or equal <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">I </em>equivalent).</p>

<p>2-2.8 Window Contacts: if windows are functional, due to the climate environment, open and close, both top and bottom then the windows need to <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">be </em>protected, such as window contacts (GE #1032 or equal/equivalent), top and bottom, this will be determined during the pre-bid inspection. A second window magnet (GE #1937 or equal/equivalent) may be requested thus this window can be opened at the same time as keeping the alarm system armed. A specialty alarm contact (GRI # VS-06 or equal/equivalent manufacture) may be requested, this would allow window venting of four to six inches before breaking contact and activating an alarm. This would be the preferred method, being that the alarm system would not have to be armed/disarmed, could open and close the window with the alarm system armed. If this specialty contact is selected the security contractor will be required to install stop blocks to prevent the window from opening beyond the six inch range preventing someone from attempting to enter through the window opening.</p>

<p>3-3.1 Access control Shunt: Security contractor to provide programmable shunting of selected alarm contact(s) at electronic access control points for either ingress and or egress during after hour use,. when the alarm system is armed. Existing alarm system was already configured to provide this feature. This will require the security contactor to interface the door alarm contact(s) to an existing electronic access control system, security contractor shall be responsible for providing and or coordinating this interface (GSA has ownership of electronic access in this building, except for USMS space). It is preferred that the alarm point remain connected to the FPS alarm panel input and that the shunt be provided by a programmable aux output relay from the access control panel. Consequently providing a short across the door contact(s), vs. wiring to the access control panel (others) first then using an output relay board from the access control board to the alarm panel input board. Wiring would be one wire directly from the alarm panel input to the door contact(s) and one wire directly from the access control panel aux relay across the door contact(s).</p>

<p>Notice Type: Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />Note! All correspondence must be submitted to the Contracting POCs.<br />1. Part: U.S. Government Procurements<br />2. Subpart: Services<br />3. Procurement Classification Code: R-Professional, Scientific and Technical Services <br />4. Agency: Department of the Air Force<br />5. Responsible Office and Address: Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), Contracting Division (PKE); Mail to: AFNWC/PKE; Attn: Mr. Richard K. Mijokovich; Bldg. 20226, Rm. 9, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117.<br />6. Notice Type: Notice Of Contract Action (NOCA) - Sole Source Contract<br />7. Subject: The United States Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) in coordination with the United States Air Force 498th Nuclear System Group (498th NSG), 709th Nuclear System Squadron (709th NSS) intends to issue a contract, FA9422-10-R-0004, to acquire Modified BBU-63/B Bomb Ejection Impulse Cartridges. This contract will provide technical and analytical expertise for the modification of BBU-63/B Bomb Ejection Impulse Cartridges to provide the BRU-44B/A ejection rack with the explosive energy required for ejection.</p>
<p>AFNWC/PKE intends to solicit and negotiate a contract on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source, to Scot Inc. This authority allows for "supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment when it is likely" and award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. This NOCA is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the requirement. <br />Based on an evaluation of the Ogden Air Logistics Center AMC/AMSC Screening Analysis Worksheet Report, there are only two approved sources of supply for the Impulse Cartridges with the National Stock Number of 1377015028981 that is Scot Inc. and Ogden Air Logistics Center.</p>
<p>Since the cartridges are designed for use on the B-2 aircraft and the structural and functional integrity can be affected by individual manufacturer's processes and techniques, the part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. To ensure continued product integrity, procurement is restricted to sources known to have the required experience and capability. New potential sources must be approved prior to contract award. However, due to the purpose of this contract effort, award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements and further details are provided in paragraph 8 below.</p>
<p>The recent purchase history from Scot Inc. includes the following contracts: FA821308C0062, FA821308C0051, and FA821308C0050. This purchase history demonstrates, Scot Inc. is the original manufacturer of the current BBU-63/B cartridges in the Air Force inventory that will be modified during this contract effort.</p>
<p>8. Description of the Efforts Needed Statement of Work (SOW): The 498th NSG and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) plan to conduct BRU 44B/A rack testing. The objective of the BRU 44B/A rack test is to characterize the shock and vibration environment of the ejection event. The BBU 63/B cartridge performance is a key part of the ejection environment. In order to define all possible ejection environments, the testing will require customized BBU 63/B cartridges that perform at the edges of the current BBU 63/B cartridge's production specifications. Under this contract, the Government will provide 180 BBU-63/B cartridges as Government Furnished Material (GFM). The offeror will deliver 120 modified BBU 63/B cartridges, which meet the specific performance requirements necessary for the Air Force and SNL BRU 44B/A rack testing. In addition, the offeror will conduct 60 Closed Bomb Tests (CBTs), using the offeror's testing facility, in order to characterize the performance of the modified cartridges. The offeror will have 5 months to complete the contract effort. To ensure validity of the data and successful BRU-44B/A testing, it is critical to control as many variables as possible during the cartridge modification and testing process. Using the only approved source of supply, whom is also the original manufacturer of the cartridges, and using this sources' CBT facility will ensure no new variables are introduced into this critical testing process. To approve a new source of supply to conduct the modification and testing would therefore result in substantial duplication of costs and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. <br />9. All responsible sources, including Scot Inc., may submit a capability statement in order to demonstrate their ability to fulfill the above requirements within the period of performance. The Statement of Capability (SOC) shall contain the information: (a) Demonstrate ability perform CBT, (b) demonstrate prior expertise in building impulse cartridges, (c) demonstrate an understanding of how to modify the cartridges and provide a notional plan to show the cartridges can be modified within 5 months of contract start, (d) provide resumes on key personnel and their expertise in building and modifying impulse cartridges. Please make sure that your information includes your company's CAGE Code and current Central Contractor Registration (CCR) information, DUNS number, financial information, business size, and other information deemed relevant to be capable of satisfying the government's need. Firms responding should indicate if they are a Small Business, a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business, an 8(a) Certified Business, a Woman-Owned Business and/or a HUBZone Certified Small Business Concern. To be considered a Small Business the following applies: NAICS Code: 541712, aircraft parts, auxiliary equipment, and aircraft engine parts exception, size standard 1000 employees. <br />a. Page limitation: The SOC is limited to a total of 10 pages, single spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman. The Government will not consider pages in excess of the limitation. Key personnel and resume information is not included in the page count.</p>
<p>b. Submission: Original plus two (2) copies are due no later 2:00 pm MST on 12 May 2010.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
<p>ACQUISITION OF MASINT ADVANCED ENGINEERING &amp; SCIENCE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS OFFERING (MAESTRO)</p>
<p><br />A. PURPOSE: The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine if there are any small or large businesses available who are capable of performing the MAESTRO effort described herein. The Air Force Institute of Technology (Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, OH) is seeking sources to provide a broad range of academic technical services and expertise at the graduate level (post baccalaureate) within the fields of Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) and systems engineering that are not available within the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) to support the research and education mission of the Center for MASINT Studies and Research (CMSR) and the Center for Systems Engineering (CSE).</p>
<p>The CMSR's mission is to "provide a cadre of MASINT oriented graduates by conducting graduate-level research and education in coordination with government, industry and academia." The CSE's mission is to "advance the practice of systems engineering across the Air Force enterprise" by collaborating with government organizations and the private sector. Hereafter within the context of this Sources Sought, unless otherwise specified, the term "Center" refers to both the CMSR and the CSE collectively.</p>
<p>Through MAESTRO, (MASINT Advanced Engineering &amp; Science Technical Requirements Offering), the Centers desire to obtain Project Services (PS), including contractor support, to help faculty, staff, managers, and supervisors execute their research and education missions. The draft MAESTRO Performance Work Statement (PWS) (Attachment 1) identifies the contractor support required to assist the Center in the implementation and development of initiatives for current tasks. Since there is a high probability of future work during the life of the MAESTRO contract, additional Task Orders may be added to support future Center tasks.</p>
<p>B. BUSINESS SUMMARY: These are performance based services with an estimated ceiling of $24M with all task orders. A core requirement consisting of a 3-year base with one 2-year option period is anticipated (June 2011 through May 2015). Orders or discrete tasking issued on an annual basis are anticipated pending funds availability. A multiple award contract may be considered. These are not inherently governmental functions, personal services, or Mission Essential services.</p>
<p>There are five (5) desired outcomes of this effort as listed below:</p>
<p>CMSR desired outcomes of this effort are: <br />(1) quality instruction and yearly updates to existing course material<br />(2) the development of entirely new course material based on the MASINT/AGI disciplines<br />(3) expansion of the Center's Distance Learning (DL) offerings <br />(4) new research and publication of research accomplishments in peer reviewed conferences and/or journals</p>
<p>CSE desired outcome of the effort is focused on:<br />(5) new case studies that will be distributed throughout the academic and acquisition communities by the Center</p>
<p>C. DISCLAIMER: Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not reimburse the respondents for any costs associated with their responses. This Synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request. The Government reserves the right to contact the submitting parties, on an as-required basis, for further clarification on information provided. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of market research being conducted by the Air Force to identify capable potential sources. The Government may use the capabilities information gathered from the MAESTRO Sources Sought Synopsis to develop an acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>D. SMALL BUSINESS (SB) SET-ASIDE: No set aside decision has been made. However, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a SB Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14*, Limitations on Subcontracting. NOTE: If a SB Set-Aside determination is made for MAESTRO services, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern (i.e. prime SB contractor).</p>
<p>* FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996)<br />(a) This clause does not apply to the unrestricted portion of a partial set-aside.<br />(b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the offeror/contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for:<br />(1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>Capability statements and the summary table submitted by large business must discuss the potential for achievement of DoD and Air Force small business goal categories such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBC&amp;U), Women Owned Small Business (WOSB), Small Disadvantages Business (SDB), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), etc.</p>
<p>E. NAICS and SIZE STANDARD: The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes to establish size standards on an industry-by-industry basis. MAESTRO will utilize NAICS code: 611310, "Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools" (size standard threshold $7M).</p>

<a href="mailto:eric.eischen@us.army.mil">Rock Island Contracting Center (RI-CC)</a>
<DESC><BR>The purpose of this Sources Sought announcement is to identify worldwide sources capable of manufacturing the M142 Firing Device, NSN:  1375-01-040-1526, DODIC:  ML03.  This announcement is in support of Market Research performed by the United States Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center, to determine interest in a potential Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 procurement for the M142 Firing Device. <BR> <BR>Item Description:  The M142 is a mechanical firing device intended for use as a remote detonator with demolition charges.  It is also used for assisting training to combat booby traps or can be attached to signal flares for use in locating enemy combatants.  The basic component of the device is a mechanical switch designed for actuation by pressure, pull, pressure release, or tension release.  The M142 can be used to ignite either a blasting cap or a time blasting fuse for setting a short delay. The device is weather sealed and will function under water.  The firing device consists of a number of different components to facilitate operation in its various modes; they are the switch, sear plate, and firing pins.  The switch contains a spring loaded firing pin held in position by a movable sear plate that can be set to release the firing pin in one of the four operating modes.  Fifty (50) feet of copper or steel tripwire are wound on a cardboard or plastic spool.  A coat of paint over the wire prevents it from accidentally unwinding. The tension release attachment is a specially formed stainless steel wire with a spring type action.<BR><BR>The coupling body is a cylindrical plastic assembly that contains an M42 primer, which is the explosive initiating element. The coupling body is interchangeable with the standard coupling base in functioning attached blasting caps and has the alternate capability of lighting a time blasting fuse. An instruction sheet giving abbreviated set-up instructions is provided with each device. Fasteners, a set of nails and screws, for securing the switch are included with each device. <BR>The M142 firing device components in addition to the instruction sheet, screws and nails are packed in a cylindrical metal or plastic container 3-1/8 in. diameter and 1-1/4 in. high. Fifty-six containers are packed in four M19A1 ammunition boxes (14 per box).<BR><BR>The manufacturing process of the M142 encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) precision molding of plastic parts, (2) spring and wire formation, (3) primer loading in the coupling body, (4) electrodeposited and painted metal coatings, and (5) load, assemble, and pack-out (LAP) of the completed firing devices.  For different stages of the manufacturing process, special inspection and test equipment is required to ensure that the final products comply with Government requirements.  Special fixtures and conditioning chambers are required to perform First Article and Lot Acceptance tests on the Firing Devices.  Production of the Firing Devices requires the capabilities of precision plastic molding, metal forming and finishing, and functional testing.  The M142 Firing Device is procured to a U.S. Government Technical Data Package (TDP).<BR>  <BR>Responses:  Interested companies, U.S. or Foreign, who consider themselves capable of manufacturing the M142 Firing Device, are invited to indicate their interest by providing the U.S. Government the following information:  a brief summary of the companys capabilities (a description of the facilities, personnel experience, quality system, and past manufacturing experience) and their availability.  If a respondent does not have adequate resources (facilities, technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, then they must be able to demonstrate their ability to obtain those resources without significant delay.  Any potential sub-tier vendors or subcontractors should also be addressed, by indicating which components or sub-components would be subcontracted and providing a brief summary of potential component and sub-component suppliers.  Respondents are encouraged to address the feasibility of or alternatives to the Governments preferred lead-time of 180 days after award for First Article Test (FAT) Report and 270 days after award for production deliveries to commence.<BR>    <BR>Interested companies are requested to provide rough order of magnitude (ROM) prices for estimated FY11 production quantities of 50,000 or 100,000 each M142 Firing Devices and a ROM for First Article Test.<BR>  <BR>The full U.S. Government TDP will not be provided at this time, however a top-level drawing will be provided to interested sources upon their written request to the POC below.  This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  The Government will utilize the information provided in developing the acquisition strategy for future requirements for this item.  All submissions are requested electronically within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication (22 Nov 2010).  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.  All companies interested in a potential future solicitation for this item must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database.<BR><BR>No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.  No basis for claim against the U.S. Government shall arise as a result from a response to this announcement or U.S. Government use of any information provided.

<DESC>Introduction

This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your response to this information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541712 should not submit a response to this notice.

Background

The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Data and Clinical Coordinating Center (DCCC) for a new five-year program, Pumps for Kids, Infants, and Neonates (PumpKIN) clinical trials.   The purpose of the program is to explore the potential benefit of therapy offered by novel pediatric circulatory support devices to infants, neonates, and young children (<25 kg) with congenital and acquired cardiovascular disease who experience cardiopulmonary failure and circulatory collapse. The trials are intended to provide clinical evidence to be used in Humanitarian Device Exemption applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for regulatory approval of the devices. As the PumpKIN DCCC, the contractor will have the overall responsibility for the operation of the trials and will provide the necessary administrative guidance, oversight, and support to achieve the trials’ objectives.  The DCCC will be responsible for finalizing the clinical protocols, manual of operations, and monitoring procedures, address other clinical issues, and run the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) trials according to the planned timeline.  

NHLBI currently funds four contractors to complete the necessary pre-clinical development, testing, evaluation, and manufacturing of their devices for the PumpKIN clinical trial. Each of these four PumpKIN pre-clinical contractors will work with the DCCC and a Protocol Development Committee consisting of the other pre-clinical contractors, NHLBI staff, and other NHLBI-appointed experts to develop and finalize their IDE clinical trial designs and protocols.  The clinical trial plans and protocols are expected to be submitted by the PumpKIN pre-clinical contractors to the FDA as part of their IDE applications during the third year of the current PumpKIN program with approval targeted by the end of Year 3.  The DCCC will be responsible for providing each pre-clinical contractor with the protocol that is to be submitted with their IDE application to the FDA for their device.  

The PumpKIN pre-clinical contractors will provide regulatory and device technical support throughout the clinical study.  Initially, these activities will be funded during the pre-clinical contracts.  After completion of the pre-clinical contracts, funds for such activities will be provided through subcontracts under the DCCC PumpKIN contract.

Project Requirements

The DCCC shall conduct all aspects (administrative guidance, oversight, and support) of the PumpKIN clinical trials. The DCCC shall have overall responsibility for the operation of the clinical trials which includes clinical site coordination, data collection, management, and analyses, and preparation of clinical regulatory documents in support of an Investigation Device Exemption (IDE) clinical trial. The DCCC shall 1) Work with NHLBI to identify competent clinical sites for the trials and finalize subcontracts for the selected clinical sites; 2) Arrange steering committee, protocol review committee, and protocol development committee meetings and arrange data safety and monitoring board activities; 3) Coordinate protocol and manual of procedures writing activities; 4) Develop and distribute clinical trial forms, case report forms, and other reporting tables and figures; 5) Create clinical trial logos, newsletters, brochures, posters, and checklists; 6) Perform clinical regulatory activities including: obtaining research agreements and IRB approvals with each of the clinical sites, monitoring device accountability records by IDE sponsors, obtaining investigator agreements, monitoring clinical sites, informing investigators of plans and study-related reports, and providing clinical reports to the FDA and IRBs (See http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYour
Device/InvestigationalDeviceExemptionIDE/ucm046702.htm#resofspofor for further information on IDE responsibilities.)  7) Establish working groups to standardize protocols and establish quality standards for clinical data to be collected; 8) Develop a secure web-based data entry system for data collection and distribution of information to the clinical sites; 9) Develop a training plan and train the clinical site and core laboratories for all aspects of the PumpKIN program; 10) Develop a data analysis plan for the trials and develop a complete data set distribution plan; 11) Manage clinical sites to achieve the goals of the PumpKIN clinical trials. Activities related to this requirement include monitoring patient recruitment, maximizing patient adherence and retention; and auditing the participating clinical sites to maintain quality control; 12) Prepare and distribute technical and statistical reports; 13) Review data to ensure scientific validity and to ensure privacy policies are being properly followed; 14) Organize and maintain IRB approvals, informed consents, and other relevant documents; 15) Collaborate with the FDA by preparing and submitting required reports/data to the FDA; 16) Facilitate communications among all organizational trial components; 17) Maintain the computer system, secure trial database, and software needed for the storage and analysis of all trial data (including biological specimens) collected from all PumpKIN clinical sites and core laboratories; 18) Work with the steering committee to establish a publications and presentations policy and infrastructure for review/prioritization of manuscripts and abstracts; 19) Design and implement a plan for trial closeout, analysis, and dissemination, including final data collection, data transfer (if necessary), verification, analytical support for scientific writing groups, publication of trial results, and plans for the investigators’ dissemination of trial results; and 20) Analyze data and prepare trial reports, create a public dataset and data sharing plan, and create and distribute all final reports to the NHLBI and FDA.

<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. THE DMID, NIAID, NIH, WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Under the current contracts, research progress has been made in several key areas. A major emphasis of the contract for vaccine respiratory pathogens research has been evaluating strategies to improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in populations at increased risk for complications from influenza and clinical studies of influenza vaccines with pandemic potential. The contract for bacterial respiratory pathogens research has focused on the development of a human challenge model for nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, treatment strategies for pseudomonas infections, and diagnostic methods to discriminate between colonization and infection with S. pneumoniae. These contracts have also provided resources for the respiratory diseases research community, including reagents (e.g. strains, reagents, clinical specimens, data, etc.) and services (e.g., assay support and training).</p>
<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to recompete this research program, under the title "Respiratory Pathogens Research Centers" (RPRC), to continue to provide DMID with the capability of conducting translational and clinical research focused on the development and optimization of control measures for viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Under the RPRC program, research on the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, as well as influenza and RSV and the impact of bacterial/viral co-infections on disease progression and severity will be emphasized.</p>
<p>The RFP that will be issued will be composed of two parts with separate contracts to be awarded for each Part: PART A: Viral Respiratory Pathogens Research Center (VRPRC), and PART B: Bacterial Respiratory Pathogens Research Center (BRPRC).</p>
<p>Together, these programs will comprise the NIAID Respiratory Pathogens Research Center (RPRC), which fills an important gap in NIAID's respiratory diseases research portfolio by supporting multidisciplinary translational and clinical research projects focused on developing information and tools and the evaluation of improved strategies for controlling these infections.</p>

ESAF System Parameters

System Function
 ESAF function is to detect and locate, diagnose, and render safe/neutralize electronic fuzing, power supplies including the energized circuitry and sensor suites outside of their detection envelopes and is man and/or machine employed.
  The system must be able to detect passive and active, energized circuitry and sensor suites without influencing the circuit, and determine the armed and/or safe status of electronic fuzing, this must happen in real time.  The system will not be required to detect targets that are buried beneath the earthâ€™s surface.  


â€¢	Detection range 
The detection range is the distance at which the ESAF system must be able to detect a threat.  The system should be able to detect a threat when mounted on a vehicle at a minimum distance of 50 meters plus the stopping distance when traveling at maximum speed of 50kph. (It is estimated that the maximum speed that a fully loaded EOD vehicle would travel is 50kph.)   The detection fan area is the space in front of the vehicle that would provide detection capabilities of 50 meters in both directions measured from the center line of the vehicle.
  This would provide a 180Â° arc in front of the vehicle.  The system also needs to be able to detect 25 meters up and 10 meters below the mounted position on the vehicle to provide detection capabilities when passing over or going under overpasses, hills, etc.  These thresholds will provide a â€œdetection bubbleâ€ in the front of the vehicle.  The threat may be non-line of sight.

Thresholds:  Mounted moving vehicle:  50 meters plus the stopping distance, 180Â° arc 

When the system is deployed in the dismounted configuration the minimum distance for detection of threat must be 25 meters.  The speed of a normal person walking in a dismounted operation is estimated between 3 to 5 mph.  The ESAF system must cover a 120Â° arc in front of the patrol.
   The threat may be non-line of sight.

	Threshold:  Dismounted 25 meters, 120Â° arc

The above distances were derived from the â€œ5 - 25 â€“ 50â€ rule used by EOD when responding to an incident.  The 5 meters is a visible radius check around the vehicle as soon as it comes to a stop.  The 25 meters is an expanded radius check using detection equipment.  The 50 meters is the minimum distance to a threat from the vehicle.
	
Locate
To locate a threat are those actions taken to determine the presence and fix the location that would be needed to perform a neutralization/render safe procedure (see Neutralize/Render Safe Procedures) of an unexploded explosive ordnance or IED that has an ESAF type firing system.
  The ESAF location system must be able to locate electronic fuzing, power supplies, energized circuitry, and sensor suites outside of their detection range, estimated to be 50 to 100 meters maximum.  This needs to happen within the detection capabilities and detection range thresholds.

Diagnose
Diagnose whether the electronic fuzing, power supplies, energized circuitry, and sensor suites are actually active and functioning outside of their detection range, estimated to be 50 to 100 meters maximum.  This would occur while stationary and at road speeds of 50 kph during mounted operations.
	Threshold â€“ 50 meters  
Objective â€“ Less then 50 meters

Neutralize/Render Safe Procedure
Neutralize/RSP the electronic fuzing, power supplies, energized circuitry, and sensor suites outside of their detection range, estimated to be 50 to 100 meters maximum.
 This would occur from a stationary position.
	Threshold â€“ 50 meters
Objective â€“ Less then 50 meters

Set Up Time:
Time required preparing the ESAF, while in the safe area, for use.  Preparation assumes the system is already mounted or pre-positioned on platform, and would be time from â€œturn onâ€ to ready, including any checks to ensure functionality and mount or add any additional parts necessary for use.
	Threshold â€“ 5 minutes
		
Interoperability
Ability of system to be interoperable with the platform or prime mover it is mounted to.  This includes being interoperable with power systems, vehicle protective systems, other attachments to the platform (i.e. antennas), and currently existing mounts.
  
Threshold â€“ Must be interoperable with current tactical vehicles used by Joint EOD forces.

Compatibility
Capability of the system to be used at the same time as other EOD equipment in the area (i.e. CREW systems)		
Threshold â€“ Operable in a CREW environment  

Ease of Use / Training
Must be employed by an EOD technician with existing skills and requires a minimal amount of system training.
	Threshold â€“ System training shall be designed to be conducted at unit level

Time on target
The time it takes to detect the target; perform a RSP/neutralization procedure and perform the final diagnoses on the fuze.
Threshold â€“ 20 minutes

<a href="mailto:tom.e.dickert@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Louisville</a>
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the Danbury, CT area. The project consists of the design and construction of a Newtown/Bridgeport Armed Forces Reserve Center (approximately 112,000 SF), Combined Maintenance Facility and Maintenance Training Bay Building (approximately 27,000 SF, 2 Unheated Storage Buildings (approximately 4,700 SF and 650 SF), and organizational parking.<BR><BR>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <BR><BR>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<BR><BR>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <BR>b. The complexity of the project. <BR>c. Shortage of skilled labor in region. <BR>d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<BR>e. The use of PLAs on other comparable projects. <BR>f. The promotion of the Governments long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <BR>g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <BR>h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <BR><BR>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. <BR><BR>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<BR><BR>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <BR><BR>a. Should a PLA be executed on the Danbury, CT Reserve Center contract? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in the contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<BR><BR>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<BR><BR>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <BR><BR>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <BR><BR>e. The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on the project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <BR><BR>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <BR><BR>g. Completion of the anticipated project will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<BR><BR>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <BR><BR>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <BR><BR>Responses shall be submitted via email to Tom Dickert at tom.e.dickert@usace.army.mil no later than 1:00 PM EST on 04 November 2010.<BR><BR>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Tactical Situational Awareness (TactSA) Application Suite
<p>USSOCOM is seeking sources with the demonstrated capability to engineer a Tactical Situational Awareness (TactSA) software suite that will provide reliable and standardized data between battery operated micro-computers over Mobile Ad hoc Wireless Networks (MANETs). The data will traverse peer-to-peer networks without centralized servers or syncs. It will consist of numerous video streams, file transfers, Position Location Information (PLI), and whiteboarding collaboration tools. <br />TactSA display Application: Currently SOF has a FalconView-based SA display tool that provides the necessary capability on Windows platforms. Due to the shift in commercial hardware to mobile, battery powered systems, it is necessary to extend the SA capabilities to lighter devices that utilize the Android operating system. With the standardized data structure design described below, the user requires the ability to transition from a windows based system running FalconView to an Android based system running the TactSA display. The computing device will be connected to a GFE MANET dismount radio via USB or Ethernet. The TactSA display shall be the core moving map display for the display of all information available on the network.<br />Sub Applications: Additional applications and features are necessary to launch from the TactSA display that also utilize the tools, structures, protocols and mechanisms identified below for peer-to-peer networks. In addition to the dynamic SA mapping application the vendor must provide a chat application (Instant Message and chat room), reliable multicast file transfer, multi-touch whiteboarding aka John Madden tool, and ability to display multiple H.264/MPEG 4 video streams individually and simultaneously. These applications shall also recover from network outages and substantial packet loss. <br />Application reliability: At present many applications are developed for wired networks that do not handle network outages and retransmissions well. They rely on TCP, which has been proven not to be well suited for wireless networks. The government requires that fault tolerance be built into the TactSA, Chat, PLI and file transfer applications. The overall solution should be light enough for ultra mobile personal computers and tablet systems that cannot buffer large amounts of data. It shall provide an automatic data structure repair.<br />Reliable Multicast: The tactical MANET shall consist of at least two MANET networks connected via a commercial router. At any point each MANET must function independently to transfer the data seamlessly to the end client devices. As data flows within one over to the other network, packet-loss due to RF effects will occur. It is necessary to provide a Durability and Retransmission mechanism for application reliability. Such a protocol shall provide end-to-end reliable transport of data streams over generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services as described in RFC 5740. Due to the real-time nature of the data, multicast dissemination is critical to the effective use of the networks.<br />Application security: Although the radio systems provide encryption capability over the air, it is necessary to provide a second layer of security at the application layer. Third party VPN/IPsec technologies do not natively support multicast and do not provide peer-to-peer topologies. The encryption scheme shall utilize Suite B algorithms for protecting the data prior to traversing outside of the computational device. The approach shall have to be explained and designed for Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) accreditation for FIPS PUB 197.<br />Data structure: Due to numerous Graphic Information System (GIS) display applications it is necessary to utilize RFC validated protocols and extensible markup languages such as XML and derivatives to standardize the data. The objective capability is a seamless data architecture that delivers the network traffic to numerous GIS display technologies such as FalconView and Google Earth. The structure will be defined in a document as well as implemented in the TactSA suite.<br />Demonstrated capability to perform the work described (such as tangible examples, experience or past performance) are more desirable than novel approaches, although both will be given due consideration. No format for the response is specified and no questions will be answered. Please limit the technical approach to ten (10) pages and the entire submission (including supporting information) shall not exceed thirty (30) pages. Only electronic submissions in Adobe Acrobat 8.0 (or higher) or Microsoft Word (1997-2007) will be accepted (no hard copies). Potential sources must possess an active Facility Clearance (FCL) or be eligible to obtain an FCL at the SECRET level.</p>

<p>1. Provide all equipment, supplies and services as agreed upon in the contract.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>

<p>Attached are the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) &amp; Health &amp; Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) clauses that are applicable including below.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (June 2008).<br />Quotes shall be submitted on company letterhead stationery. Signed and dated. And it shall include:<br />1. Solicitation number<br />2. Closing Date: <strong>November 5, 2010 at 3:00 pm CST</strong><br />3. Name, address and telephone number of company and email address of contact person.<br />4. Technical description of the item/service being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements of the <br />solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary<br />5. Terms of any express warranty<br />6. Price and any discount terms<br />7. "Remit to" address, if different from mailing address<br />8. A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3<br />9. Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments (if any issued)<br />10. Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or <br />similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant <br />information).</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (January 1999). The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF, OR SUBMIT A WRITTEN RESPONSE TO, THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <strong>(1) Contractor is able to respond to emergency medical requests for home respiratory equipment &amp; supplies for in-home set ups = 40 points. (2) Equipment and supplies meet Medicare standards. Service contract agreement meets criteria for Medicare servicing, evaluation of patient's need for equipment and &lsquo;lease to own' guidelines = 40 points. (3) Contractor is capable of providing continuous in-home services for the RCHCF service delivery area = 20 points</strong>. The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the task in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a task order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the tasks to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among proposals with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. Technical Criteria will be 70% and cost will be 30% determining factors for this award. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s). (c) A written notice of award of acceptance or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (August 2009). See attachment for full text and instructions for completion.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (June 2010), applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (July 2010). See attachment for full text.</p>
<p>In addition, Contractors shall provide the following:</p>

Complete and sign Agreement to a temporary provisional of character investigations (for government contractors only).<br />4.

Yellowstone National Park requires a renewable energy system for the Bechler Ranger Station. The following is a detail of the requirement:
BackgroundThe Bechler Ranger (Soldier) Station was established in 1910 in a remote outpost that was occupied by the US Army to help curb the growing threat of illegal hunting in the park. The Ranger Station is located in the most remote location within the lower 48 United States. Today the National Park Service (NPS) operates the facility from May until November (due to the severity of the winters). It functions as a public contact area for hikers, backpackers, fishermen and tour groups. Approximately six rangers reside at the facility during the summer season.
Scope of work Currently, the NPS facilities depend on a 20 KW propane generator to supply all electrical requirements. The generator operates 24 hours a day from early May until late October. The generator powers a large well pump for supplying potable water for employees and visitors as well as providing water for the fire suppression system. Additionally, all employee residences and a public contact station are powered by the generator. In the past, the park examined the feasibility of installing a photovoltaic system that would reduce the dependency of the propane generator. Due to the severe winter months, it was realized that the batteries would have to be removed from the area every fall and re-installed every spring.  The permanently installed solar panels would be subjected to very heavy snow loads (up to 10ft) and would also have to be disconnected every fall. As a result, it was determined that a permanent photovoltaic system would not be practical.
Through technological advances, various companies now produce state-of-art photovoltaic systems that are portable. The solar panels are mounted on the roof of an enclosed trailer that houses the battery bank, all switch gear, DC/AC inverter and a high efficiency backup propane generator. This application would be ideal for the Bechler Ranger Station, as the trailer would be moved out of the area during the winter months and used in different areas of the park where winters are not as severe. It is anticipated that the trailer unit will provide over 80% renewable energy for the Bechler complex. This will result in an estimated reduction of over 21 metric tons of green house gases, annually.
Over 5,000 visitors enjoy the Bechler area every summer; hence the park will have a tremendous opportunity to inform/educate visitors on the environmental attributes of producing electricity from the sun. It is envisioned that this project will serve as a model for other remote sites within Yellowstone NP and other national parks within the United States. Lastly, the trailer will be used during the winter months in a variety of venues throughout the Yellowstone region that will result in high visibility benefits. This will include special park headquarters events, traveling to various high schools and universities within Montana, Idaho and Wyoming and regional gateway community functions.

(1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard.
(2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employeeâ€™s clearance status may suffice depending on the employeeâ€™s status within the JPAS database.
(3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material.
(4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued.

VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER.
Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States.
 By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that personâ€™s citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery).

 The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><strong><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to assess the market opportunity, develop a business plan, recommend necessary technical requirements, training needs and cost estimates of expanding Pakistan International Airlines' MRO facility.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND SUMMARY</p>
<p>Established in 1954, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is Pakistan's flagship air carrier servicing 36 international destinations and 25 domestic routes. It is the 31st largest airline in Asia with main offices in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. PIA currently operates an MRO facility servicing its own aircraft but is looking to expand operations and target business from other carriers both domestic and foreign. PIA plans to establish a comprehensive facility that would service engines, landing gear, airframes, and aircraft components. The operation would service both Boeing and Airbus aircraft, as well as engines from major manufacturers. PIA plans to integrate the facility within its existing operation in Karachi at Jinnah International Airport, its main hub. PIA believes that its pool of qualified, low-cost engineers will make it more competitive for an MRO, relative to others in the region, thus enabling it to capture a significant portion of the market. As such, PIA has requested USTDA funding for a Feasibility Study to: examine the market opportunity for a Pakistan based MRO; develop a marketing strategy and business plan; develop an appropriate organizational structure for the new venture; assess the technical and legal/regulatory requirements for establishment and operation; prepare an implementation plan; and examine potential partnerships with U.S. companies for equipment and services.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $864,002 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM local time in Pakistan, November 30, 2010 at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

(To determine if the public has access to the compensation information, see the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission total compensation filings at http://www.sec.gov/answers/execomp.htm.)</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, by the end of the month following the month of a first-tier subcontract with a value of $25,000 or more, and annually thereafter, the Contractor shall report the names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated executives for each first-tier subcontractor for the subcontractor's preceding completed fiscal year at http://www.fsrs.gov, if--</p>
<p>(i) In the subcontractor's preceding fiscal year, the subcontractor received--</p>
<p>(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and</p>

(To determine if the public has access to the compensation information, see the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission total compensation filings at http://www.sec.gov/answers/execomp.htm.)</p>
<p>(d)(1) If the Contractor in the previous tax year had gross income, from all sources, under $300,000, the Contractor is exempt from the requirement to report subcontractor awards.</p>
<p>(2) If a subcontractor in the previous tax year had gross income from all sources under $300,000, the Contractor does not need to report awards to that subcontractor.</p>
<p>(e) Phase-in of reporting of subcontracts of $25,000 or more.</p>

<p><br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449).

<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>
<p>(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);</p>
<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<DESC>The following questions and subsequent answers are being provided:<BR><BR>1. Are there 350 rooms required, that exact amount? <BR>ANSWER: that is estimated number (but should no more than)<BR><BR>2. 14 additional rooms are required priced seperatly? - can you explain what you mean by priced seperately? Are VIPs staying in these rooms? <BR>ANSWER: priced separately means apart from over-all solicitation cost; we're obtaining estimate for these people who will be paying separately from the contract <BR><BR>3. Is the solicitation for roughly triple star rated facility or 4 star? <BR>ANSWER: star rating's have not been taken into account; however, the facility(s) would have to pass inspections and be viewed by leadership personnel, to ascertain the viability of holding event at said location(s) <BR><BR>4. Hotel management will be providing all food, meals, snacks and drinks per the sow. Is the client providing any of the required food or drinks? <BR>ANSWER: From what I understand, the government will not be providing any food or drink <BR><BR>5. What day will you award the contract? Our commitment from the hotel management must be in sync. <BR>ANSWER: We plan to award no later than 19 Nov, but will do so sooner if at all possible <BR><BR>6. If awarded the contract will you expedite payment? - how long until we receive full reimbursement per the contract? <BR>ANSWER: Invoice and acceptance of services would be accomplished through Wide Area Workflow (WAWF), the government's electronic invoicing system (company would need to register in this system prior to submitting an invoice) <BR><BR>7. Can you give us an itenirary of events for Dec. 10-11? <BR>ANSWER: Itinerary of events can be provided; would have to obtain these from the program coordinator <BR><BR>8. Can your base personnell inspect the hotel - conf. facility we have under contract w/in the next 5 days? We are negotiating the contract parameters now.<BR>ANSWER: Inspection within the next 5 days would be highly unlikely; maybe within the next week or two; we normally hold off on performing inspections until bids have come back and qualified bidders (according to initial solicitation requirements) have been identified. <BR><BR>9. What time will the attendees start arriving Fri. 12/10 <BR>ANSWER: anytime after hotel allows checkin for that day (I'm assuming)<BR><BR>10. What time will the attendees depart from the facilities on Sat. 12/11<BR>ANSWER: they will accomplish check-out per hotel procedures; meetings go to around 4:00pm/4:30pm  <BR><BR>11. Does the Base (Client) need the ballroom space and all other meeting rooms for both Fri. and Sat. <BR>ANSWER: meeting rooms are required for only Sat (11 Dec) <BR><BR>12. Is the dinner Fri. night buffet style vs. menu; is the seating style round table <BR>ANSWER: there is no dinner requested for Fri night (10 Dec) - only breakfast, lunch, and afternoon beverage/snack option (per statement of work) <BR><BR>13. Are any of your meetings running concurrent on Fri. or Sat. - or, is each meeting room running a seperate program for both Fri. and Sat. <BR>ANSWER: there are no meetings scheduled for Fri; all meetings are taking place on Sat (11 Dec) <BR> <BR>14. the specs indicate you need 1 ballroom on Sat. to accommodate up to 700, 4 break-out meeting rooms and 2 additional rooms.  We have one very competative hotel / conf. center who is asking can some of the rooms be flipped; in other words, can we overlap the use of the ballroom? Or, does the ballroom need to be seperate altogether from the other meeting / misc. rooms?<BR>ANSWER: yes, the ballroom can be flipped, meaning once the initial purposes of the ballroom (meeting in AM that has all attendees present, a type of initial briefing). A site visit would verify from our standpoint that this would suffice (how room would be set up to accommodate other meeting room requirements), but I was given info originally that this would be acceptable.

Yellowstone National Park requires a renewable energy system for the Bechler Ranger Station. The following is a detail of the requirement:
BackgroundThe Bechler Ranger (Soldier) Station was established in 1910 in a remote outpost that was occupied by the US Army to help curb the growing threat of illegal hunting in the park. The Ranger Station is located in the most remote location within the lower 48 United States. Today the National Park Service (NPS) operates the facility from May until November (due to the severity of the winters). It functions as a public contact area for hikers, backpackers, fishermen and tour groups. Approximately six rangers reside at the facility during the summer season.
Scope of work Currently, the NPS facilities depend on a 20 KW propane generator to supply all electrical requirements. The generator operates 24 hours a day from early May until late October. The generator powers a large well pump for supplying potable water for employees and visitors as well as providing water for the fire suppression system. Additionally, all employee residences and a public contact station are powered by the generator. In the past, the park examined the feasibility of installing a photovoltaic system that would reduce the dependency of the propane generator. Due to the severe winter months, it was realized that the batteries would have to be removed from the area every fall and re-installed every spring.  The permanently installed solar panels would be subjected to very heavy snow loads (up to 10ft) and would also have to be disconnected every fall. As a result, it was determined that a permanent photovoltaic system would not be practical.
Through technological advances, various companies now produce state-of-art photovoltaic systems that are portable. The solar panels are mounted on the roof of an enclosed trailer that houses the battery bank, all switch gear, DC/AC inverter and a high efficiency backup propane generator. This application would be ideal for the Bechler Ranger Station, as the trailer would be moved out of the area during the winter months and used in different areas of the park where winters are not as severe. It is anticipated that the trailer unit will provide over 80% renewable energy for the Bechler complex. This will result in an estimated reduction of over 21 metric tons of green house gases, annually.
Over 5,000 visitors enjoy the Bechler area every summer; hence the park will have a tremendous opportunity to inform/educate visitors on the environmental attributes of producing electricity from the sun. It is envisioned that this project will serve as a model for other remote sites within Yellowstone NP and other national parks within the United States. Lastly, the trailer will be used during the winter months in a variety of venues throughout the Yellowstone region that will result in high visibility benefits. This will include special park headquarters events, traveling to various high schools and universities within Montana, Idaho and Wyoming and regional gateway community functions.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from prospective offerors.<br /><br />1. Question: Considering the geographical constraint of personnally reviewing the document, I request you to provide us the following details: a) list of items, schedule of requirements, scope of work, terms of reference, bill of materials required.; b) soft copy of the Tender Document through email; c) names of countries that will be eligible to participate in this tender; d) information about the Tendering Procedure and Guidelines; e) estimated budget for this purchase; f) Any extension of Bidding Deadline? and g) Any addendum or pre bid meeting minutes?<br /><br />Answer: There are no bids associated with this solicitation/request for proposal. All the information needed to prepare offerors proposal are provided in the solicitation posted on FedBizOpps.
<p>2. Question: Is the term of the contract known at this time (beyond the base task order) and is there a total (maximum) amount you would envision for this contract?</p>
<p>Answer: $500,000 is the maximum allowed to be issued against either <br />contract.</p>
<p>3. Question: Is there an expected timeline to complete the work (either task order)?</p>
<p>Answer: The current schedule is thirteen weeks including Government review.</p>
<p>4. Question: Would you anticipate awarding follow-on work that is of similar nature (energy audits or facility assessments) for the remainder of the lab area?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes</p>
<p>5. Question: Are there incumbent(s) whose contract has recently expired and would be seeking re-award of this type of procurement? Would you share who the most recent selectees for similar contracts are please?</p>
<p>Answer: The solicitation is open to all qualified respondents. The last time the work was done was over five years ago.</p>
<p>6. Question: Are you at liberty to share the position of the selection committee (their job titles/roles in the organization)?</p>
<p>Answer: The selection committee will be composed of professionals working in facility management at NRL.</p>
<p>7. Question: Please clarify the number of copies required for this SF- 330 submission.</p>
<p>Answer: Submission should be one original and one copy of SF-330.</p>
<p>8. Question: Please clarify the size/complexity of the project examples that you would like to see for firm's past project experience.</p>
<p>Answer: The responding offeror should be able to demonstrate the ability to perform the work for the contract for which they wish to compete. While having some relevance, audits of homes, schools, and such are of less importance than audits of laboratories.</p>
<p>9. Question: Since the first contract is to deal with energy audits and assessment related to energy usage and water usage and will be looked at by the contractor, is the contractor for the second contract to include assessment, life expectancy, costs, etc for the MEP systems in your facilities with the scope of their services?</p>
<p>Answer: There will be two contracts. Offerors are free to respond to either or both of the prospective contracts. Each audit should be complete and be able to stand on its own. The Government will then use the results of the audit to plan future work. This planning is not expected to involve the auditors.</p>
<p>10. Question: The solicitation seems to suggest that the first assessment of 1,000,000 square feet is to be completed within nine weeks. Is this correct?</p>
<p>Answer: The current schedule is thirteen weeks with Government review. The schedule builds in four weeks of Government Review time. This review time is divided into periods after each submission but total four weeks for the entire Delivery Order.</p>
<p>11. Question: :What is meant/understood by "Pollution Prevention"? (Selection Criteria Para A, Specialized Experience)<br /><br />Answer: This is a standard requirement of the Federal Acquisition Register. While this is usually applied to Designers developing construction contracts, both audits represent ways to either reduce emissions and waste or to reduce the use of hazardous materials.</p>
<p>12. Question: What is meant/understood by "The use of recovered materials"? (Selection Criteria Para A, Specialized Experience)</p>
<p>Answer: This is a standard requirement of the Federal Acquisition Register. This is usually applied to Designers developing construction contracts. The Facility Conditions Audit has opportunities to adaptively utilize materials that were previously used.</p>
<p>13. Question: What are the deliverables/energy software?</p>
<p>Answer: The primary deliverable is the result and recommendations of the Audits. Other supporting documentation that is germane to the audit should be included. The energy software may be any commercially or publicly available software used for the purpose of analyzing the energy consumption of buildings. This will allow the Government to continue to model the energy usage of the buildings after the audit and to model proposed changes. The software will be capable of running on current personal computers running the current version of Microsoft Windows Operating System.</p>
<p>14. Question: Will hand delivered submission be accepted, if so what is the address for delivery? Also is there a page limit for this submission?</p>
<p>Answer: Proposals may be hand delivered to the Contracting Office, Naval Research laboratory, 4555 Overlook Avenue, S.W. Washington DC 20375, Building 222, Room 115 between the hours of 8 AM until 4 PM, local time, excluding weekends and federal holidays. NRL is a controlled-access facility. Photo identification will be required. Report to Building 72, Visitor Control for access to NRL.

All offerors shall allow sufficient time for delivery of their proposal to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date and time announced in the solicitation. Directions and additional information about NRL is available at http://www.nrl.navy.mil/content.php?P=PLANNINGVISIT.</p>
<p>While there is no set limit on the number of pages to be submitted, a proposal that is not clear, concise, and coherent will not reflect well for the respondent.</p>
<p>15. Question: Can you please tell me how many copies of our submission you would like us to submit? And do you have any requirements for number of pages or font sizes?</p>
<p>Answer: Please see answers to questions 7 and 14.<br /><br />16. Question: If a large business is selected, will there be an expectation to include a small business plan and will there be corresponding small business goals? If yes, are there typical small business goals you assign at the Office of Naval Research that would apply here?</p>
<p>Answer: The answer is Yes to all questions in number 16.</p>
<p>17. Question: Do you have a specific geographic area of extent in mind for the offeror's location?</p>
<p>Answer: No.</p>

<a href="mailto:retha.renee.adams@us.army.mil">US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Deputy Commander</a>
<DESC>The Logistics Lift Airship technologies development  is urgently needed to enhance the capabilities of the Department of Defense in transporting personnel, supplies, equipment and other  materials to increasingly numerous and dispersed locations around the world to respond to any crisis.  The Logistics Airship technology development  is needed to support current and anticipated Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) challenges and emerging joint service operational concepts.<BR> <BR>The Government is interested in receiving White Papers (as described in Paragraph 6.a. of the Broad Agency Announcement) NLT 29 October 2010 for a Logistics variant of Hybrid Airship/Airship designs that can augment existing theater transportation delivery capabilities while minimizing transportation risks and cost.<BR> <BR>Specific Areas of Interest include propulsion systems, lightweight high-strength airship materials, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, airship landing systems for ground winds up to 80 knots, innovative methods for cargo handling including a roll-on roll-off and winching system cargo bay for use in austere and unimproved locations and onboard manned flight control and navigation systems.<BR><BR>Hybrid Airship/Airships designs must be capable of transporting greater than or equal to 40,000 pounds of flexible payload (vehicles, pallets, litters, personnel, etc.) at altitudes greater than or equal to 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) with a cruise speed greater than or equal to 80 knots and have a range of at least 1000 nautical miles. <BR><BR>The Government is seeking to enhance performance and reliability of Logistics Lift Airship technologies. White Papers should address technical and scientific development in the Technology area of Space Augmentation under High Altitude Platforms and Power Systems and Propulsion (paragraphs 4.g.(1) and 4.g.(3) of the BAA) as they apply to a Logistics Lift Airship. The White Papers should describe the proposed system architectures in such a way as to help the Government assess the technology in terms of potential size, weight, power efficiency, power generation, maturity, hull shape, operational effectiveness, affordability, reliability, maintainability, supportability, environmental acceptability, concept of operations, risks, ruggedness, interoperability, Air worthiness and flight certification procedures. The White Papers should identify critical technologies needing further development to enable a Logistics Lift Airship to meet the general requirements.<BR><BR>In order to receive optimum consideration, the White Papers must be received by 29 October 2010. The Government may request full proposals for promising concepts that may result in the award of multiple Cost Plus Fixed Fee contracts with a Base Period value of approximately $150,000 and a contract value (Base and all options) of up to $49M. The government reserves the right to make some or no awards and to request revisions to contractor proposals and statements of work including requests for clarification, risk mitigation plans, changes to proposed period of performance, Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) requirements or other changes as necessary to better align with the United States Army Space Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ ARSTRAT) mission. <BR><BR>The maximum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for any effort to be performed under a contract awarded pursuant to the BAA is TRL Level 6.  <BR><BR><BR>

<p>J&amp;A Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source (except brand name)</p>
<p>Contract Award Date: N/A</p>
<p>Contract Award Number: FA9422-10-C-0002</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The United States Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) in coordination with the United States Air Force 498 Nuclear System Group intends to issue a contract, FA9422-10-C-0002, to acquire Modified BBU-63/B Bomb Ejection Impulse Cartridges. This contract will provide technical and analytical expertise to produce Modified BBU-63/B Bomb Ejection Impulse Cartridges for BRU-44B/A Ejection Rack testing.</p>
<p>Based on the Ogden Air Logistics Center AMC/AMSC Screening Analysis Worksheet Report, the only approved source of supply listed is, Scot Inc. AFNWC/PKE and the 498 NSG program office concluded that only Scot Inc. possesses the manning, capability, and experience necessary to effectively provide 498 NSG with proper modification of the BBU-63/B cartridges. Scot, Inc. is also the manufacturer of the&nbsp;BBU-63/B cartridges in current Air Force inventory.</p>
<p>AFNWC/PKE intends to award a contract on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) to Scot Inc. The FAR states that supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p><br />While this notice of intent is for information purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information which shall be considered by the agency. Capabilities information, which shall not exceed 10-pages in length, may be emailed to: Richard.Mijokovich@kirtland.af.mil. Responses from small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.</p>
<p>Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Justification and Approval document for sole source award will follow shortly. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. Any questions regarding this notice may be directed to the Government Points of Contact: Mr. Richard Mijokovich (email: Richard.Mijokovich@kirtland.af.mil, phone: 505-853-1686) or Mr. Joshua Blow (email: Joshua.Blow@kirtland.af.mil, phone at 505-846-6284).</p>

SW-8 Contractors Watering Option: Indicates that water may be obtained from any of the Governments operating wells, fill stand or fire hydrants. To provide the most cost efficient proposal, we request a map indicating the location of any water sources which may be utilized by the contactor to complete the tasks within the proposal, and whether or not water is at pressure and of adequate volume to meet construction needs. Will the Government make this information available to contractors?<BR><BR>A13. No. Government water source will be identified per individual delivery order.<BR><BR>Q14.

None have been provided with the solicitation. Will ACAD drawings be provided to the contractor to facilitate this work? <BR><BR>A17. Drawings will be provided for each individual delivery order issued.<BR><BR>Q18.  _______ is unclear on how the Government is using bid items 0002-Bonding Base Period, 1002-Bonding Option 1 Period, and Item 2002-Bonding Option 2 Period. The text states the item is &is the cost for the Performance and Payment Bonds for Construction. Performance and Payment bonds shall be calculated on the price specified minimum quantity in accordance with FAR& For the base year the solicitation states under pricing notes item 2  The minimum guarantee for this contract is $50,000 and is only applicable to the first year. If that is the case should the contract in Item 0002 Bonding Base Period use the cost for the performance and payment bonds based on the $50,000 guarantee and for Items 1002 and 2002 assume a zero cost since there is no guarantee for the option years or should the contractor include the costs for performance and payment bonds in the individual ELINs? Please clarify how the Government is required performance and payment bonds to be costed. <BR><BR>A19. In the case of an IDIQ contract, the original contract price is the price payable for the specified minimum quantity (see definition under 52.228-15(a)).  Thus, bonds should be furnished for the minimum quantity indicated in the IDIQ contract. <BR><BR>If the delivery orders for an IDIQ contract exceed the specified minimum quantity, additional performance and payment bond protection should be obtained to cover the increase in the contract price under 52.228-15(b)(3). <BR><BR>Payment for bond premiums is covered under FAR 52.232-5.  This section states that reimbursements to the contractor for performance and payment bonds should be made after the contractor has furnished evidence of full payment to the surety.  Thus, the contractor can invoice for payments made for bonds covering the original contract price once full payment has been made to the surety for that portion of the contract.  If the specified minimum quantity is exceeded, additional bonding is required, and the contractor can then invoice for the cost of the additional bonds after furnishing evidence of full payment to the surety.  After the specified minimum quantity in the IDIQ contract is reached, the contractor would in effect be requesting additional bonding and being reimbursed for such bonding for each additional delivery order.<BR><BR>Q20. Are there any additional project drawings available other than the Section 2 Zone Area Map and the Section 3 Location Map? If so, where can these documents be obtained?<BR><BR>A20. No. Drawings will be provided for each individual delivery order issued.<BR>.<BR><BR>Q21. Is there a pre-bid meeting for this project and if so when and where and what time?<BR><BR>A21. No. See A8 above.<BR><BR>Q22. Is there a bid bond for this project or do you just need a letter from them?<BR><BR>A22. In accordance with Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.228-7004 BONDS OR OTHER SECURITY (DEC 1991). Offerors shall furnish a bid guarantee in the amount of 20 percent of the bid price or $3 million, whichever is less with their bids.<BR><BR>Q23. Is there Liquidated Damages on this project, if so how much?<BR><BR>A23. No.<BR><BR>Q24. What is the completion time for this project in calendar/working days?<BR><BR>A24. The period of performance will be identified for each individual delivery order issued.<BR><BR>Q25. What is the depth of the paving items (A0007-A0150)? They are measured in square yards per the pricing schedule, but we cannot find the assumed depths of application.<BR><BR>A25.  See line items descriptions contained within Attachment 4.<BR><BR>Q26. Is there a minimum/maximum quantity that will be paved at one time or will it be as needed (on-call) type scenario such as we go fix/repave areas as they need them at whatever size they are available?<BR><BR>A26. No. Quantities will be specified for each ELIN for each individual delivery order issued.<BR><BR>Q27. How are oil and fuel escalators handled? <BR><BR>A27. The solicitation contains the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.216-4 ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT--LABOR AND MATERIAL (JAN 1997). The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer if, at any time during contract performance, the rate of pay for labor (including fringe benefits) or the unit prices for material shown in the Schedule either increase or decrease. The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price made under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original unit price. There is no percentage limitation on the amount of decreases that may be made under this clause.<BR><BR>Q28. Are there any plans available or just the sitemap on the website? <BR><BR>A28. Only sitemaps are available. Plans and drawings will be provided for each delivery order issued.<BR><BR>Q29. Would it be possible to have a site visit to determine staging requirements and familiarization with the base to include my subcontractors?<BR><BR>A29. No. See A8 above.<BR><BR>Q30. I would like clarification on where I might find additional specifications for the W9124R-10-R-0014 MICC Center Yuma Proving Grounds bid items. It was brought to my attention that the specifications explanation of the bid items and the bid items as shown on the bid schedules do not match. I would also like to know what the numbers and letters below the bid items represent. Are they from a spec book or designated list of items that are paid for in a specific way? If so where can I find this list or book?<BR><BR>A30.  The information for each Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN) is contained within Attachment 4 for this solicitation. Each ELIN description contains IAW SW-9, PARA SW-# in it. The SW-9 corresponds to which section of the attachment to reference and the SW-# after the SW-9 represents which subparagraph contains the applicable information for the ELIN.<BR><BR>Q31.

Also, I did not see a Projnet for this solicitation so if there is one, I apologize for emailing you directly. <BR><BR>A33.  There is no Projnet for this solicitation.<BR><BR>Q34. What is the deadline for the past performance submittal?<BR><BR>A34. All past performance questionnaires are to be submitted by 11:00 a.m. 2 November 2010.

<p><br />Correspondence Management System Operations and Maintenance</p>
<p><br />1. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of the Executive Secretariat in the Office of the Administrator is responsible for tracking executive correspondence and maintains the official records for the Administrator and Deputy Administrator. The effectiveness of the Office of the Executive Secretariat is dependent in part on its enterprise-wide information technology application called the Correspondence Management System (CMS). CMS is EPA's correspondence tracking and workflow management system that scans, logs, routes, tracks and stores incoming and outgoing Agency correspondence from and to members of the public, private, and governmental sectors. The purpose of this small business solicitation is to award a contract to support the operation and maintenance of the CMS application.</p>
<p><br />2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Developed using Documentum's E-Content Server 5, a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) document management solution, CMS provides a web-based user interface available for use Agency-wide to EPA personnel via EPA's secure Intranet. Documents are either entered or scanned into the system and routed through a review and approval process and a virtual record is created for each control. The system has predefined templates for responses and can import documents from other databases. After signature, the final document is scanned into the system. Authorized CMS users are able to:<br />&bull; View scanned correspondence images, drafted responses, control history, and assignment information;<br />&bull; Receive Lotus Notes e-mail notification;<br />&bull; Add supporting documents to controls from a CMS library or a PC or network drive;<br />&bull; Maintain citizen information and citizen correspondence history;<br />&bull; Search for existing controls based on a variety of control data; and<br />&bull; Generate reports, mass mailing letters, and control processing statistics.</p>
<p>The CMS application resides on the following file servers located in a secure, access-controlled environment at EPA's National Computer Center (NCC) in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina:</p>
<p><br />Hardware <br />System Software<br />1. Production Server Sun Fire V440 - E-Content Documentum 5.3 SP2</p>
<p>2. Production Server Sun Fire V210 - Web Content Apache Tomcat 2.29<br />3. Pre-Production Sun Fire V210 - E-Content Server Documentum 5.3 SP2</p>
<p>4. Pre-Production Server Sun Fire V210 - Web Content Apache Tomcat 2.29<br />5. Dell Poweredge 2650 Scanning Application Server InputAccel 5.3, Windows 2000 Server<br />6. Dell Poweredge 2650 Module Server InputAccel 5.3, Windows 2000 Server<br />7. Dell Poweredge 2850 Production Server InputAccel Input Management Console (IMC) Windows 2003 Server Standard<br />8. Dell Poweredge 1600SC AutoRender Server Windows Server 2000<br />9. IBM Blade 8843 Development Application Server Documentum Foundations Services (DFS) 6.5; JBoss<br />10. Dell PowerEdge 2850 "Jump Box" Server -Aurora MS Windows Sever 2003 <br />11. Dell PowerEdge 2850 "Jump - Sunfire Box" Server MS Windows Sever 2003</p>
<p>Support may include assistance in working with the application hosting team at the National Computer Center located in Research Triangle Park, NC and other EPA application partners.</p>
<p>CMS users use local scanners to create PDF images of incoming, outgoing, and supporting documents. Scanners feed information to two Dell servers - InputAccel 5.3 and Content rendition server - and a Tomcat Application at the NCC. Other supporting documents (e.g. word processing files, spreadsheets, .pdf) can be directly imported to CMS.</p>
<p>The following items will be attached to the Request for Proposals:</p>
<p>o Attachment 1: CMS User Manual<br />o Attachment 2: CMS Runbook<br />o Attachment 3: CMS Scanning Environment Runbook<br />o Attachment 4: CMS System Administration &amp; Operations Manual</p>
<p><br />3. SCOPE OF WORK SUMMARY</p>

<a href="mailto:laura.parsons@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>CHANGE 1, dated 21 October 2010: POC for Technical Data Request changed to Will Bass.<BR><BR>The purpose of this posting is to provide a revised notice to Pre-Solicitation Notice Number W900KK-10-R-0004, dated 2 July 2010, for the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentations (PEO STRI) Synthetic Environment (SE) Core Common Virtual Environment (CVE) Management Program.  Additionally, the former pre-solicitation number W900KK-10-R-0004 has been changed to W900KK-11-R-0002. The SE Core CVE Management Solicitation W900KK-11-R-0002 was posted on Army Single Face Industry (ASFI) on 19 October 2010 and can be accessed via the following link: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/solicitation_search_form.cfm .<BR><BR> The SE Core CVE Management effort focuses on delivering software and limited hardware to enable an interoperable CVE for training of the Warfighters. The ultimate objective of SE Core is to facilitate a virtual training environment supporting mission focused unit training that approximates the changing contemporary operational environment. <BR><BR>Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), Army Training Strategies, Army Modernization Programs, Joint/Army Training Doctrine, Joint/Army Battle Command Training Support, and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) require a fully integrated LVC Training Environment (TE). The SE Core program is the Armys virtual component of the LVC TE. SE Core will develop and sustain the Armys CVE which links current and future virtual simulation devices into an interoperable full spectrum training capability. The CVE will connect to gaming training enablers and the live and constructive environments for an integrated LVC TE capability. <BR><BR>As the Army transitions to a campaign-quality Army with a Joint and expeditionary mindset, our Soldiers require relevant, on demand training available anywhere, anytime, and tailored to their operational training requirements. SE Core is comprised of complementary efforts for developing the CVE that facilitates fair fight interoperability for virtual system and non-system Training Aids Devices Simulators and Simulations (TADSS). The program develops operational training terrain databases, models, and simulation architecture connectivity to meet Warfighter operational training requirements. The terrain and model development efforts provide non-proprietary, open format, and image generator independent CVE deliverables. The simulation architecture provides an integrated training network. These efforts, linking current and future virtual training devices/simulations, enables the Army to execute combined arms and joint training, as well as mission planning and rehearsals at home station and at deployed locations. <BR><BR>Since SE Cores system development and demonstration phase, requirements for training and SE Core have grown. SE Core will continue to produce terrain databases, common moving models, the virtual simulation architecture, changes to OneSAF, and common virtual components such as but not limited to After Action Review, Interoperability Gateway, Scenario Generation Tool, and C4I Adapter. New requirements include but are not limited to: CVE capability management for system and non-system TADSS, mission planning and rehearsal visualization capability, acquisition of terrain source data, development of database centers, SE Core to TADSS plug-in expansion, sound and smell representation, semi-automated forces development and integration, exercise preparation and execution capabilities and definitions for the terms interoperability and fair fight. SE Core will also facilitate integration and updates concerning OneSAF and SE Core version releases into system and non-system virtual TADSS. <BR><BR>The SE Core CVE Management competition will be conducted on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis with best-value tradeoff evaluation procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 541512. The small business size standard is $25M (this is only applicable to small business Offerors who wish to participate in this full and open competition). The SE Core CVE Management solicitation will result in a five year, single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract. <BR><BR>The proposal should be based on the program of record anticipated funding identified herein. <BR><BR>To assist in determination of appropriate allocation across Statements of Work, the following is provided: Top priorities are Transition Phase-In and Production related CLINS.

<DESC>Structural Health Monitoring systems are envisaged to provide two criticallyimportant capabilities for the health monitoring of future aerospace vehicles: detectingstructural damage and performing comprehensive structural monitoring. The goal of thiswork is to bring together in a consistent topology, technological approaches developed byNASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) and Australia's Commonwealth Scientific andIndustrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in an integrated system demonstration on largescale aerospace vehicle structures.  This is a continuation of efforts through previouscontracts with NASA to utilize innovations based on technologies developed by CSIRO. This research and development activity will develop and demonstrate a structural healthmonitoring system for thermal protection systems (TPS) that incorporates piezoelectricacoustic emission (AE) sensors to detect the occurrence and location of damaging impacts,and an optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor network to evaluate the effect ofdetected damage on the thermal conductivity of the TPS material.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
As required by FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency

1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee, WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Repair of Endoscopes on an emergency basis for the Jesse Brown VAMC, Chicago IL.
		    
3.  	A Description of Supplies/Services required:  Jesse Brown VAMC requested the urgent repair of four (4) flexible endoscopes.  Per the end user, the Jesse Brown VAMC is in a critical shortage of operable endoscopes in order to meet patient diagnosis and treatment needs.
  
4.	Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2(a)(2).  The VA's need for the supply is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless VA is permitted to limit the number of sources. (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2)).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  Unusual and compelling urgency to repair Olympus endoscopes to original condition.  The endoscopes are highly advanced allowing the Jesse Brown VAMC to detect lesions and treat them.  The lack of endoscopes create unacceptable delays and cancelations from providing proper care and creating the possibility of life threatening situations for critically ill bleeding patients.  

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  The Small Purchase Center and Contract Service Center conducted research and concluded there were no viable GSA contracts for the products. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Price is comparable with other contracted repairs for similar type items.

8.	Market survey conducted:  The Small Purchase Center contacted Olympus and it was determined endoscope repair was not covered under this vendors GSA contract.  Since this is an emergency request, no further market research was conducted.   

9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  In the future, the station should identify projects, plan ahead and identify special equipment needs before they become an emergency.  

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

Based upon information received from the station, we concur that it is in the best interest of the government to proceed with the emergency procurement with this firm.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization: VA Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS), Seattle, Washington.

2.	Description of Action:  This is a justification for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a six month, firm-fixed price Janitorial contract with By George, LLC.  

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, materials, supplies, machinery, equipment and appliances necessary to provide environmental sanitation services at the Mt. Vernon Community Based Outpatient Clinic, located at 307 S. 13th Street, Mt. Vernon, WA, 98273.  The Contractor shall perform these services Monday through Friday. The estimated cost of services for the six month period of performance is $24,582.84.

4.	Statutory Authority:  
(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	( )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  By George LLC is the incumbent contractor for the Janitorial contract at Mt Vernon.  They have successfully performed this service over the past 15 months and have the capability and staff to continue performance for the next six months. There were several extenuating circumstances that contributed to the current status of this now urgent requirement:  By George LLC was competitively awarded a three month base period and four one year option periods on 15 June 2009.  However, due to an administrative oversight, between the Service Line Budget Analyst and the Contracting Officer the second option year was not exercised.  The Contracting Officer then notified the contractor to continue performing service under Purchase Order 663-C11735 through 31 March 2011 to allow time to re-solicit the service. Since this is a cleaning contract for a medical clinic, it is essential that this six month interim contract be awarded.  The health and hygiene for patients and staff would be adversely affected if the work areas were not cleaned on a daily basis. The award of this contract will allow the Contracting office sufficient time to conduct another competition to award another janitorial service contract.  

6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  This office is in the process of conducting a competition set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) with an anticipated award date of on/about 1 April 2011.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the  
Government is $24,582.84.  IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii) pricing is identical to the original contract negotiated pricing for the option year two renewal and is determined fair and reasonable. Ref: Contract VA260-P-0646.  

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  Market research was not formally conducted for this service, but prior to the award of the initial contract that expired; By George submitted the proposal that was determined to be best value to the government.  Since the price and the level of services are not changing and based on the urgency of this request, further market analysis was not conducted.  Furthermore, in order to ensure uninterrupted housekeeping for our Veterans in the CBOC and the extreme urgency of continuing services without interruption, it is in the Government's best interest to award this six month interim contract to the incumbent By George LLC.  

9.	Other Considerations:  None.

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None.

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: See line #6.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FOR FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE PROGRAM


Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as COTR (Kokkheang Lim) hereby approve the use of sources limited to fewer than those required in FAR 8.405-1, FAR 8.405-2 pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 251 as implemented by FAR 8.405-6 (b)

1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity and specific identification of the document as a limited source justification (LSJ).
	Department of Veterans Affairs
	 VISN 08, Bay Pines V.A. Medical Center. 

2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  

The Bay Pines VA Healthcare System (VAHCS) Pharmacy Service is requesting orders for admixture of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) solutions with daily deliveries.  A total of approximately seven (7) TPN will be purchased daily, three hundred and sixty-five (365) days per year. The estimated annual cost associated with this contract is $165,620.00.  


3.	A complete description of the supplies and/or services required to meet the agency's needs

The Bay Pines VA Healthcare System (VAHCS) Pharmacy Service is requesting orders for admixture of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) solutions with daily deliveries.  A total of approximately seven (7) TPN will be purchased daily, three hundred and sixty-five (365) days per year. The estimated annual cost associated with this contract is $165,620.00.  Patient Specific TPN admixture is only available from one manufacturer/distributor in South Florida. Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) admixture and delivery service is provided by Central Admixture Pharmacy-Service, Inc, (CAPs) for hospitalized patients. Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) Service Division will prepare and guarantee daily deliveries for each individual TPN as requested by Pharmacy Service.  This contract is necessary to provide Pharmacy Service with a cost-effective alternative to in-house production of TPN.  It allows the Pharmacy Service to redistribute workload among pharmacy technicians previously assigned to TPN and IV admixture preparation.  CAPS will assign an invoice number to each individual preparation order.  That invoice number will match each individual TPN preparation and will be used by CAPS to prepare a monthly manifest for service rendered during each month. Each TPN could be an admixture of two or more of the products.  The TPNs (Total Parenteral Nutrition) are administered to patients with poor nutritional profile. The cost to prepare (admixture) by the Bay Pines VAHCS Pharmacy is very high due to the staff involved and is extremely time consuming (man-hours). Pharmacy Service staff are overloaded due to shortage in staff (pharmacists and technicians). CAPS, Inc. is the ONLY source in South Florida that both prepares and delivers TPN and meets VHA, FDA and JCAHO admixture standards.

4.	An identification of the LSJ rationale, and if applicable, a demonstration of the contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.

FAR 8.405-6 (b) (1) - Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work;

Market Research was performed by Bay Pines Pharmacy Service using GSA, CCR and local telephone book. Only one other pharmacy, Lorens Pharmaceuticals was found who provides TPN, however, they do not provide patient specific admixture. Proteins provided are premixed and are not given in IV bags. Only CAPS provides the TPN products required for our VA beneficiaries.

5.	A determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d).  
The estimated annual cost associated with this contract is $165,620.00, and the price is consistent with a current contract that is serviced by Miami VA Hospital Pharmacy.

6.	A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders, and the results of the research, or a statement why market research was not conducted.  A statement must be made that the supplies and services are available from the FSS. 

Market Research was performed by Bay Pines Pharmacy Service using GSA, CCR, internet searches, and local telephone book. During our search, there weren't any vendors available to perform this service.

7.	Any other facts supporting the limited source justification.
 
CAPS, Inc. is the ONLY source in Florida that both prepares and delivers TPN and meets VHA, FDA and JCAHO admixture standards.

8.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency will take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for supplies and services is made.

Bay Pines VAHCS Pharmacy Service will in future, do more extensive market research to see if other vendors are available to provide this type of service.  Pharmacy Service staff will attend yearly conferences whenever available. Pharmacy Service will try to seek out other vendors to see if they can provide this service in the future.

9.	The ordering activity Contracting Officer's certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief and evidence that the supporting data that  form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by technical/program personnel.
