<CONTACT>Maria S Shamburger, Email HEG9@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCIRD/DVD/OD, 1600 Clifton Rd. NE, Atlanta, GA, 30333, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to Atlanta Research and Education Foundation, 2250 North Druid Hills Road, NE, Suite 238, Atlanta, GA 30329, to conduct a prospective analysis to better study factors related to Acute Gastroenteritis (AGE) within the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers. The specific objectives of the project are as follows: <br />1. Assess the incidence of outpatient visits, hospital admissions, community-acquired, and hospital-acquired acute gastroenteritis, including norovirus, rotavirus and other pathogens in VA facilities, by conducting active inpatient and passive outpatient surveillance for AGE. <br />2. Study the pathways of AGE transmission in the household of patients in a VA population, by conducting follow up interviews and collecting stool and serum samples from AGE cases several weeks following enrollment.<br />3. Other Direct Costs (ODC) include (a) testing acute and convalescent stool specimens to determine etiologies, (b) testing saliva and serum specimens to assess immune responses and HBGA expression, (c) providing patient reimbursement for study participation, and (d) assessing the relationship between the microbiome, secretor status and norovirus infection.<br />4. Characterize the severity of AGE and specific pathogens detected among patients with stool samples submitted for routine diagnostic testing while hospitalized by conducting inpatient passive surveillance.<br />5. Conduct retrospective medical chart reviews and testing of AGE stool samples collected.<br />6. Determine the economic burden of AGE-associated hospitalizations and outpatient visits in the VA population.<br />7. Conduct surveillance for ARI pathogens identified through physician-directed testing and assess outcomes of patients.<br />8. Collect serologic specimens from patients with pathogen-confirmed ARIs.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." In 1988, Congress passed Public Law (P.L.) 100-322 [now codified at sections 7361-66 of title 38, United States Code (U.S.C.)], which permitted the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to authorize the establishment of Nonprofit Research Corporations (NPC) at VA medical centers (VAMC). This laid the foundation for creation of unique partnerships to conduct VA-approved research. P.L. 100-322 allowed the establishment of private, state-chartered, nonprofit entities to provide flexible funding mechanisms for the administration of funds, other than those appropriated to VA, for the conduct of VA-approved research. <br /><br />In 1999, Congress expanded the NPCs' authority to include support for VA's education and training missions. The fundamental purpose of the NPCs is to serve Veterans by supporting VA research and education in order to improve the quality of care that Veterans receive.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Research and Education Foundation, Inc. (AREF) is a nonprofit corporation that was created to advance the research and educational activities for the staff at the Atlanta Department of Veterans' Affairs Medical Center. AREF established an exclusive collaborative partnership with the Atlanta VA Medical Center to administer a variety of medical research programs for government agencies. As mandated by Congress with the passing of P.L. 100-322, AREF is the only non-profit corporation created to conduct and administer medical research for the Atlanta VA facilities. AREF is essential to meeting the Government's requirement to study the burden of viral gastroenteritis and acute respiratory illness in the VA patient population. The market research indicated that no other company is authorized and no other company can be modified to meet CDC's need to conduct medical research for the Atlanta VA facility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to Maria Shamburger, Contracting Officer, Reference 2019-1018, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: Maria Shamburger, MS: K14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with the Atlanta Research and Education Foundation as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<a href="mailto:joshua.d.huckeby@faa.gov">Click here to email Joshua Huckeby</a>
<DESC>This is a market survey for organizational level (O-Level) service and maintenance of the Mobile Video Surveillance System (MVSS). The MVSS system is a surveillance system mounted in the bed of a light duty 4X4 truck (e.g., F-150) or similar mobile platform so that surveillance can be deployed to field positions.  The vendor must service and maintain the surveillance system to keep it operational.  The scope of work will include Operations and Maintenance (O&M) services for repair, supply support, maintenance, and current and/or future MVSS system information technology (IT) technical maintenance services.

It is the FAAs intent to develop, award, and administer a contractual agreement on behalf of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in order to obtain a maintenance and sustainability capability that will support this effort.

The contractor would be responsible for maintenance and logistics support within the Rio Grande Valley Sector (McAllen, TX). There is also a potential need at the following sectors (Laredo, TX; Del Rio, TX, Marfa, TX and El Paso, TX).

Attached is a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) describing the scope of work required for this effort. The FAA is seeking input from industry regarding recommended approaches to support the requirement.

Responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals at this time. Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense. 


The FAA anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a period of performance of five years (one one-year base period with four one-year option periods).

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

In addition to receiving industry input as to recommended approaches, this market survey will be utilized to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, in particular service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the required support. This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or 8(a) certified firms.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, with a size standard of $20.5M.  

The FAA requires the following (limited to 30 pages) from interested vendors based on the attached draft SOO:

1. Recommended programmatic approach - Respondents must provide their recommended approach for accomplishing this work.

2. Clearly state whether or not you can provide all of the types of services required and if you can supply them to all of the geographical locations listed in the draft SOO. 

3. Capability Statement - This document should identify:
     - Type of services provided by your firm
     - Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)
     - Number of years in business
     
All responses to this market survey must be received by 4:00 p.m. CT on 31 October, 2018.   All responses to this announcement should be submitted via email to the Contracting Specialist and Technical POC at the following:

Joshua.d.huckeby@faa.gov (Contracting Specialist)
John.mccachern@faa.gov (Technical POC)

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITAITON SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS FOR RAILROAD MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.  The Solicitation Number for this announcement is N4008518R1608. THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE RELEASED VIA THE INTERNET.  This will be the only method for distributing solicitation documents and amendments.  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING AND DOWNLOADING AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: https://www.neco.navy.mil and www.fbo.gov .   The official plan holders list will be maintained and can be printed from the website only.  Amendments will be posted to the website for viewing and downloading. IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO PERIODICALLY CHECK THE WEBSITE FOR AMENDMENTS.  ALL PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS AND PLAN ROOMS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER ON THE WEBSITE.
All contractual and technical questions shall be submitted to Annette Taylor via e-mail at annette.taylor1@navy.mil.  

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Lant, PWD Crane, will issue a request for proposals for an Indefinite-delivery/Indefinite-quantity Requirements (IDIQ) type contract to accomplish Railroad Maintenance and Repair construction services.  Work will be performed at the Naval Support Activity (NSA Crane), Crane, Indiana.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, management, materials, supplies, equipment, tools, transportation, incidental engineering, vehicles and quality control necessary to perform maintenance and repairs on railroad trackage including replacement of rails, ties, crossings and accessories, surfacing, alignment, dressing of ballast, ditch maintenance, and incidental related work.
Government does not guarantee a minimum amount of services to be ordered.  However, the Government is obligated to order from the Contractor, and no other source, all supplies or services of the type described in the contract which are contracted for during the contract term.  Exceptions are railroad maintenance work which will be accomplished by Government forces, work included as part of new mil-con project, or other new or major renovation projects.  

Low Price Technically Acceptable selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and experience information, and a price (or cost) proposal for evaluation by the Government will be used.  Award will be made to the offeror submitting the lowest price, technically acceptable proposal.


The term of the contract will be a base period of twelve months and three (3) 12-month option periods to be exercised at the Governments discretion.  The contract maximum is $10 million or 48 months, whichever comes first. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 237990, Other heavy and civil Engineering Construction.  The Small Business Size Standard is $36,500,000.00.

This contract will replace a requirements contract for similar services awarded in 2015 with a maximum value of $5 million.  Information about the current contract and the incumbent contractor (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) will be included in the solicitation package.  Requests under the Freedom of Information Act are not required for this information.
A sources sought notice was posted on 11 January 2018 under solicitation N4008518R1608 on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.
 As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  The NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic small business office concurs with this decision.   Large business concerns are required to submit a subcontracting plan prior to award of the contract.

The apparent successful offeror must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to contract award. Offerors not already registered in the SAM database are highly encouraged to do so via Internet at: http://www.sam.gov.  Registration in SAM is free.  
Approximate release date of the solicitation is 02 November 2018 with proposals due no earlier than 30 calendar days after the actual release date.

<CONTACT>Tyus, Renita A.
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1),with with Malvern PANalytical, Inc. for the purchase of a replacement an X-ray Fluorescence Super Sharp X-ray Tube SST R and SST(Part #9430 027 92452).

The EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), Drinking Water Treatment Distribution Branch (DWTDB) at AWBERC, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH  45268 conduits aging water infrastructure research focusing primarily on the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) which is a treatment technique regulation promulgated in 1991. The LCR requires water system to conduct tap sampling for lead and copper. DWTDB conducts sample analysis using a Malvern PANalytical X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF), which needs a replacement Super Sharp X-Ray tube to be installed SST R and SST. The tube identified above is a direct replacement of the one installed within the instrument when it was originally purchased, as such, its performance specifications are made to match that original tube.  This is critical for the following reason: 1) Over the past decade the laboratory has developed a large host of analytical data derived from the analysis of hundreds of samples. Accurate comparisons of past data with future data can best be achieved by minimizing variations created by instrumental operating parameters; 2) The performance of other instrument sub-systems, e.g. signal detectors are tied closely to the performance of the tube which is generating the energy needed to create the signals.  Variations in the tube specifications can create a situation where the data signal lies outside the adjustment range of the detectors; and 3) The performance of the instrumental operating software is tied closely to the manufactured specifications as well as the changes expected over time. A tube that does not match expectations may become progressively harder to adjust for. 

Malvern PANalytical does not recommend, approve or have agreements with third parties and are not liable for situations including and defect, damage of other subsystems, user safety, inaccurate data collection or analysis arising from any parts or items that have not been manufactured by Malvern PANalytical. Based on the critical reasons identified above, it is in the Agency's best interest to purchase the Malvern PANalytical replacement part directly form the manufacturer.
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures using Far Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  It is our intent to award a single fixed price purchase order. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Submit your request in writing to the Contracting Officer, Renita Tyus, through the message center in FedConnect.  TELEPHONE AND EMAIL RESPONSES WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT FOR SOLE SOURCE

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in Research Triangle Park, NC, intends to award a sole source purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Qiagen, Inc. to purchase Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) with Advanced Analytics Software.
EPA has used the Ingenuity Pathway Software since 2004 and have generated volumes of legacy data. As such, it is required for continuity of data analyses for the comparison of newly generated contemporary data in the research project.  Procurement of this software will enable comparative analyses over the entire research project.  
Ingenuity Pathways Analysis Software is a web-based application that enables researchers to explore, understand, and discover relevant networks significant to their research results.  Using a researchers gene or protein dataset in combination with Ingenuity's genome-scale knowledge base, the application generates multiple biologic networks with an associated functional analysis to facilitate biological understanding of the dataset. 
Specifically it:
A. Supports genomic and proteomic data analysis
B. Enables discovery of novel genes, proteins and interactions (canonical) pathways
C. Allows expansion of pathways to identify putative targets
D. Contains manually curated pathways from full-text scientific literature (not just abstracts)
E. Allows comparisons of 2 groups of pathways
F. Allows user creation of a pathway from a set of genes 
G. Develops pathways from an input gene list on the "fly", meaning it develops a pathway from just that set of genes and no others
This is a unique Pathway Analysis software that allows researchers to view their data in terms of networks of pathways in an "interactomic fashion."  There are no pathway analysis packages on the market today that contains the depth of annotated pathways as provided by Ingenuity Pathway Software. 
The circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106-1(b) "Soliciting from a single source".  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 7 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored.  The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please submit response ONLY to Sammie Jones at jones.sammie@epa.gov.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

Dear Interested Parties,
<p>The United States Agency for International Development in Vietnam (USAID/Vietnam) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a five-year contract for USAID/Vietnam Strengthening Provincial Capacity (SPC) program.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, local officials from remote provinces do not have access to quality, relevant capacity development opportunities to enable them to do their jobs effectively.  This is hindering the ability of Vietnam to implement economic and governance reforms that promote continued economic growth and level the playing field for all investors.  In order to effectively target local officials to implement and monitor policies, laws, and regulations more effectively, to enable continued economic growth and investment, Vietnamese institutions must be able to design and deliver relevant trainings in a systemic, sustainable manner.  The purpose of this activity is to strengthen the capacity and build the sustainability of local institutions' provincial capacity building extension services to provide high quality, relevant interventions addressing capacity gaps, so that provincial officials can implement and measure economic governance reforms more effectively.</p>
<p>USAID intends to use full and open competition for this procurement.  The solicitation will be released in approximately two weeks and will be made available electronically upon its release to www.fbo.gov.   The solicitation will utilize a Statement of Objectives, with offerors provided the Performance Work Statement and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plans as part of the proposal.  USAID/Vietnam is still determining contract type, but potential offerors should be prepared for some type of fixed price mechanism.  USAID/Vietnam also intends to utilize a build-to-budget model for this contract.  USAID/Vietnam will host a pre-proposal conference for the solicitation on/about November 9, 2018 in Hanoi.</p>
<p>Prospective Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to internal USAID approvals and the availability of funds. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and in no way obligates the US Government to issue an RFP/IFB and/or award a contract. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.2. If a solicitation is issued, all necessary information will be supplied at the time it is posted at www.fbo.gov. Questions/requests for information will not be responded to until RFP issuance. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website and solicitation number for updates concerning this procurement.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />/s/<br />Michael Capobianco<br />Contracting Officer</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: W9128F18R0020<br /><br />Notice Type: Presolicitation<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />W9128F18R0020 - On or about 2 November 2018, the Government intends to issue one solicitation for a $95M Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Rapid Disaster Infrastructure (RDI) to up to four (4) Small Businesses (SB). Task Orders within the MATOC may be Cost Reimbursable, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contingent upon the Government's assessment of project risk. The Primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a size standard for Small Business of $36.5 million dollars.
<p>The individual Indefinite Delivery Type (IDT) contracts will have a combined capacity of $95M. This MATOC will have a total period of performance of five (5) years from the date of award, to include a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods. Options will be exercised per FAR 17.207 and contract clauses. Individual Task Orders will be solicited and competed within the MATOC pool. The minimum guarantee amount for the total contract to include the option period(s) is $2,500.00.</p>
<p>This RDI MATOC allows for a full range of time-sensitive disaster, infrastructure, and construction related scopes of work to support federally funded customers.</p>
<p>Projects may vary in size, complexity, and location, and will require a high degree of flexibility and adaptability. The Contractor must respond quickly and effectively. All work will be time-sensitive in nature, necessitating an immediate response to mitigate threat to life and property and/or operational impacts to the government. Examples include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>* Flood Recovery: flood control and water diversion projects, embankments, channel alignments and flood control structures in support of civil works missions. <br />* Infrastructure Recovery: restoration, repair, and demolition of facilities, utilities, real property systems, and other infrastructure requirement that cannot be performed in required timeframes with normal contract mechanisms to meet vital mission requirements. <br />* Emergency Management: response actions such as unwatering missions, debris recovery, temporary housing, and other actions to meet vital mission requirements.<br />* Military: construction of facilities, infrastructure, water and sanitation systems, electrical systems, natural gas and other energy systems, fences, lighting, and roads to support troop movements and other crucial military missions.</p>
<p>Each Task Order Request for Proposal will identify when the contractor must mobilize; however, emergency recovery actions may require mobilization within 3 days of Government Notification. <br /><br />Projects may require incidental design and/or ecological/environmental, hazardous waste recovery, and munitions work.</p>
<p>This Scope also encompasses construction applications and technologies needed to support time-sensitive construction projects in various locations within the U.S. (defined as all 50 states). Individual Task Orders will further define specific project requirements once identified.</p>
<p>Proposal Evaluation: Award will be made on the basis of the lowest price, technically acceptable method. Tradeoffs are not permitted. Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using non-cost/price factors. Technical acceptability will be determined first. Award will be made to the lowest price offer(s) that are technically acceptable.</p>
<p>Offerors:<br />Please be advised that an online registration requirement in System for Award Management (SAM) database http://www.sam.gov/ exists and directed solicitation provisions concerning electronic annual Representations and Certifications on SAM. Representations and certifications are required to be up-dated annually as a minimum to keep information current, accurate and complete.

Description
The Program Contracting Office Central (PCAC) plans on submitting a solicitation in the next 30 days for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM) for the purpose of selecting a contractor to provide review and monitoring of EUL projects in the post-transaction phase of the lifecycle (i.e. after lease execution), including independent trust agreements, accounting services, financial services for all financial structures under the enhanced-use lease program, and to provide auditing services.  The selected contractor will also provide support for the development and ongoing transaction of executed enhanced-use leases and also to obtain post transaction services support for Section 111 Historic Reuse projects.
This will be a combined synopsis/solicitation Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items . This solicitation will be a request for proposals (RFP). 
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541611, with a small business size standard of $15 million. This will be a 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).

Background:  The Enhanced-Use Lease Authority, Title 38 United States Code Sections 8161-8169, allows the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to use available land, buildings, and other resources through an out-lease to a third party.  Current EUL authority limits EUL development to Supportive Housing; however, VA has many legacy EULs that involve services, facilities, and/or generate revenue that must be monitored.  Enhanced-Use Leases are long-term leases (up to 75 years) of VA owned facilities (land, buildings, and other resources) to the public or private sector.  The facility can be used for both VA and compatible non-VA uses; in return VA receives services, facilities, revenue, or other  in-kind  consideration.  This program is administrated by VA s Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM).

Performance Period: This IDIQ shall be in effect for five years. The work on each task order placed under this IDIQ is anticipated to begin within thirty calendar days of award.  However, each individual task order shall state the specific performance period.  Work at the Government site shall not take place on Federal holidays or weekends unless directed by the Contracting Officer (CO). 

Type of Contract:  This is anticipated to be a single award IDIQ contract. Firm Fixed price task orders will be generated with a detailed PWS and issued by a Contracting Officer. The maximum (ceiling) amount is estimated at $7,000,000.00 over a five-year performance period. The contract has a onetime minimum of $2,500.00.  The contractor must demonstrate it possesses both general and specialized capability, knowledge, and skills.

Place of Performance:  The primary place of performance will be at the contractor s facilities; however, some task orders may require work to be performed at a Government facility (in such case, the place of performance will be specific in the PWS of the task order).  Any work at the Government site shall not take place on Federal holidays or weekends unless directed by the Contracting Officer (CO).

IDIQ Title:  Post Transaction Support for VA Enhanced-Use Lease Agreements Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).

The initial Task Order for the project will also be solicited simultaneously with the IDIQ solicitation. The magnitude of this first Task Order will be between $500,000 and $1,000,000. 

No questions concerning this solicitation will be answered at this time, as there will be an opportunity to submit questions after the solicitation has been posted. If you would like to send an email expressing interest in this project, that will be greatly appreciated. 
Point of Contact
Emails expressing interest in this project should be sent to the Contract Specialist, Steve Mock at steven.mock@va.gov.

<SOLNBR>MARKET-SURVEY-6375-1
<RESPDATE>110218
<CONTACT>Michelet Audige, Engineer, Email Michelet.audige.civ@mail.mil - Brad Holtzapple, Competition Advocate/Small Business Programs, Email dla.apgmr@dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency-Aberdeen, on behalf of the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM), intends to acquire Part Number: LBS-300-A2 to support the weapon systems. This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information for the potential requirement described below.
<p>Requirements Description:</p>
<p>The Laser Borelight system is a critical component of the weapon system. The Laser Boresight System is a Class 9 laser that emits a highly collimated beam of visible light for precise zeroing of a sighting system to the bore of a weapon. The LBS can zero iron sights, optics and aiming devices to a variety of direct fire weapons. This system requires 1 "AA" battery.<br /><br />The LBS comes with mandrels sized to fit into the bore of any 5.56 mm, 7.62 mm, and .50 cal weapons. The LBS fires a visible laser out of the bore to show where the bore is pointing. Using this laser, the reticle or aiming point of the device to be zeroed can be adjusted to zero the device. Since the LBS is done at 10 m a specific offset is used to create a proper zero for more realistic distances. The offset is relative to the placement of the device to be zeroed and the height over bore. In addition, the LBS offers 3 Operational modes; (Goggle, Low, and Pulse) allowing for day and night operations and providing a Marksmanship Training capability.</p>
<p>The Government does not possess the technical data package (TDP), detailed drawings and performance specifications for these items. This is not a developmental effort. Current designs have been approved by Product Manager - Soldier Precision Targeting Devices (PM-SPTD). Alternate designs must be approved by PM-SPTD.</p>
<p>The following additional NAICS apply: 333314</p>
<p>The Government requires an estimated quantity of the following over 5 years:<br />&bull; Quantity: 2,500; Part Number: LBS-300-A2; (NSN: 5860-01-471-2091)</p>
<p><br />Sensors and Lasers are considered defense unique technology due to the high quality and performance requirements and are covered by Occupational and Environmental Health: Control of Hazards to health from Laser Radiation.</p>
<p>Requested Response Information:</p>
<p>Sources that can manufacture and deliver the Laser Borelight System are requested to submit information to show their capability to manufacture or supply the Laser Borelight System. At a minimum, information submitted should include but is not limited to the following types of documentation: Questionnaire information on previous Government and commercial contracts, and data rights.</p>
<p>In your response, please include your company name, CAGE code, and a technical point of contract with email address and telephone number.</p>
<p><br />Notice, Response Due Date, and Points of Contact:</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Quote or Proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSA or reimburse any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this SSA. This Sources sought announcement (SSA) is for planning and market research purposes only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information gathered from this announcement will be used to determine if responsible sources exist, and to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or set aside for Small Business. Furthermore, the Government will use the information, in part, to determine the best acquisition strategy for a potential procurement action and/or to assist in making acquisition strategy decisions in the future.</p>
<p>All SSA responses should be emailed to the Technical and Competition Advocate Points of Contact at the email addresses listed below. No phone inquiries will be accepted, either as a response to this action or for information requests.

<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) is a capability providing the Department of Defense (DOD) cyberspace workforce the ability to conduct cyberspace operations training (including exercises and mission rehearsals), experimentation, certification, as well as the assessment and development of cyber capabilities and tactics, techniques, and procedures for missions that cross boundaries and networks. PCTE provides the capability required to train forces operating in cyberspace in accordance with congressional and DOD mandates.</p>
<p>PCTE's ultimate solution will be a cloud-based training platform to support Cyber workforce with individual through force level sustainment training, team certification, and provide the foundations for a collective training network (i.e. Cyber Flag, Cyber Guard). It will leverage existing architecture and capability, including existing Service tools connected to the various cyber ranges, in order to provide the emulated environments for virtual cyber training. The materiel development activities for PCTE include integrating hardware and software into a training platform that orchestrates event planning, training resources, and after action review into a cohesive and networked training event.</p>
<p>The PCTE platform, in its desired end state, will use integrated virtual machines connecting Cyber Training and Test Ranges. As part of the Cyber Range cloud-based environment, PCTE will have the ability to share resources, such as scenarios and content, and providing additional "maneuver space" such as emulated Red (adversarial), Blue (friendly), Grey (neutral), and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments. It will connect to six geographically disperse Cyber workforce locations and allow individual units to access capabilities and participate in distributed training (called Connectivity). PCTE is not a cyber range; it is every aspect of training exercise means and training systems that would take place in a range.</p>
<p>The PCTE program continually deploys prototype capabilities through competitive Cyber Innovation Challenges (CICs) to the field to include such capabilities as event management, environment creation/replication, and connections into to the Services' Crew Training Facilities. With continued evaluation of the CIC prototypes by Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) personnel, the PCTE platform will evolve based on changes in technology, threat, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These changes will require software developed by contractors, external vendors, and other Government organizations to be holistically incorporated into the existing platform for rapid delivery.</p>
<p>Product Manager (PdM) Cyber Resiliency and Training (CRT) is currently integrating vendor solutions into the modular PCTE baseline that includes a number of commercial and proprietary products. Integration requires technical data exchange, specifications, and coordination with other contractors to ensure compatibility and selection the best-of-breed cyberspace operations training platform. It is expected the P-CIDC contract will require the integration of software delivered under the CICs to meet identified gaps and integrate new capabilities.</p>
<p>As part of the lifecycle sustainment of PCTE, the PdM CRT has a requirement for a contracting vehicle to continue development operations with the integration of software and hardware enhancements delivered on other contracts as technology insertion occurs while conducting testing, providing periodic system updates, and fielding technology upgrades of PCTE to CMF. In addition, the contract will provide a limited operations and maintenance support for PCTE to ensure high system availability throughout the acquisition life cycle. The contract will be dynamic and agile to support a highly complex joint program operating in a number of classifications at geographically disparate sites requiring 24/7 on-demand accessibility.</p>
<p>The P-CIDC has the underlying need to ensure standardization, synchronization, and management while maximizing reuse, commonality and high system availability while maintaining the systems cyber security posture. The contract must provide for a dynamic mechanisms for multiphase configuration management, development and support, integration and sustainment labs, and technology insertion and growth.</p>
<p>The purpose of the P-CIDC contract is to support the business goals of the PCTE program. These goals include:</p>
<p>&bull; Decreasing time to produce and present training scenarios<br />&bull; Increasing training throughput<br />&bull; Increasing quality of training<br />&bull; Increasing the reuse of training scenarios/emulated environments</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES<br />The Government requires the development and integration of software, hardware and associated levels of testing to support release of PCTE material solution to satisfy current and future PCTE requirements. In this the Government seeks the contractor to deliver a fully integrated training platform involving software and hardware contributions from various sources for integration, to include performing testing prior to fielding the software. This will require such activities that include software development, system integration, test and system delivery and upgrades to ensure compliance with contract requirements and timely delivery of required products. It is expected the system development, integration and release of the PCTE platform will occur with direct Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) user-centric feedback integrated and driving agile six month capability releases.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor will provide a real time web-based reporting mechanism to collect, store and analyze operations, maintenance, supply, and inventory data of all the sites. This reporting system will provide Government access for the purposes of operations and logistics reviews. A customer call in center will be required providing twenty-four hours per day seven days a week toll-free call-in support services. The contract efforts are to include repairs and replacement stocks for maintaining required Operational Availability (Ao) of 95%; it will include updates to logistic documentation such as provisioning data, tech manuals and drawings, and provide integration instruction and field support for SW and HW upgrades at customer locations. This effort will encompass logistics support and sustainment of Regional Compute and Storage (RCS) nodes over seven locations CONUS and OCONUS.</p>

Review and monitor the quality of study data including the development and management of a computerized data monitoring system that executes quality assurance and quality control procedures to evaluate accuracy, timeliness and completeness of data submitted by the clinical sites, including verification of the clinical and laboratory data used to determine that study participants have reached protocol-defined endpoints.<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; 4. Monitor trial performance and progress and maintain a secure web-based clinical trial performance monitoring system to track key trial performance metrics (e.g. key dates, recruitment, availability of primary outcomes, missing data, etc.).<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; 5. Coordinate meetings of study Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMB) to include&nbsp;the preparation and presentation of reports on safety, data integrity, and site performance as well as coordination of meeting sites, materials, travel support, etc.).<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; 6.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for NOVEMBER is November 1, 2018 to November 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2019 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 19-REG09 and must be located within Region 9.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 17 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2018, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2019 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY19 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC>The USACE Norfolk District is seeking a business capable of conducting statutorily required Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) inspections on DoDEA facilities, Facility Condition Assessments (FCA), updates to Facility Utilization Survey (FUS) drawings and databases; updates and development of Real Property Inventory (RPI) reports, reconciliation of data, technical support and database management, and additional data collection and management.
<p>These inspections and assessments are conducted across DoDEA's three regions on more than 240 schools and support facilities, totaling more than 19 million gross square feet, across 14 countries and territories.</p>
<p>In addition to conducting surveys, assessments, data collection and reporting, the Contractor shall utilize the BUILDER database and populate it with the data collected under this contract. BUILDER is used to assist DoDEA in managing, planning, documenting, tracking, and reporting data and findings from the assessment and surveys. The Contractor shall provide all necessary technical support for BUILDER and related tools in order to support DoDEA's data collection and analysis, planning and reporting requirements.</p>
<p>The estimated annual price range is between $3,500,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>All small businesses are encouraged to respond. Upon review of responses to this sources sought, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Government's best interest. The appropriate NAICS code is 562910 with a $20.5M size standard.</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to determining the acquisition strategy. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this announcement. It is requested that interested sources submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length, single-spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the requested services identified in this survey.</p>
<p>This documentation shall address, as a minimum, the following (1) Company profile to include number of employees, office location(s), DUNS number, CAGE code, and statement regarding small business designation and status. Please state all of the socio-economic categories in which your company belongs (8(a), Hub-zone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman Owned).</p>
<p>In addition to the above submission requirements, please answer the following questions as it relates to this announcement, and the following supplemental information.<br />The inspections and assessments rotate annually across DoDEA's three regions (Europe, Pacific, Americas). However, the ancillary support services including data management, reporting, and other technical support services concerns DoDEA's entire portfolio of facilities. <br />In general the Government will issue an initial contract for these ancillary support services and assessment of DoDEA-Europe facilities where the Contractor would assess and report on these facilities over the course of a year. Upon substantial completion of this first contract, another contract would be issued to continue support services and assess DoDEA-Pacific facilities, also spanning approximately one year. Upon substantial completion of this effort, another contract would be issued to continue support services and assess DoDEA-Americas facilities spanning approximately one year, and so on. The approximately annual level of effort for support services and assessments is approximately $3.5M-$4.5M. <br />In addition, the Government may issue concurrent smaller contracts for additional support services such as abatement oversight, additional technical support, etc. These additional requirements could vary from $100K to $1M. However, in total the annual concurrent level of effort shall would not exceed $5M. <br />The Government is contemplating two different ways in which to satisfy this requirement. <br />Scenario 1: The Government would solicit and award individual successive smaller stand-alone contracts concerning each region and other additional requirements individually over a course of 5 years.<br />Scenario 2: The Government would competitively solicit and award one larger 5-year Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC), where successive task orders would be awarded to a single Contractor.</p>
<p>Questions:<br />1. As a small business, do you prefer or are more likely to bid in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2?</p>
<p>2. Do you foresee any issues in consolidating the requirements per Scenario 2 versus competing it separately per Scenario 1?</p>
<p>Place of Performance: Various Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) locations Worldwide</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background/Overview:</p>
<p><br />The Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) system is being purchased for the US Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) at Ft. Sam Houston, TX. USAISR requires a process to capture specimens from cryosections, FFPE (formalin fixed and paraffin embedded) materials, native tissue like fresh plants, live cells and chromosomes allowing an investigator to define cells and tissue regions precisely, ensuring exact and reproducible results, without contamination. With the increasing use of histological samples at USAISR we require a system that allows for the simultaneous processing of tissues for multiple applications. Equipment is needed that allows for laser capture microdissection (LCM) and analysis for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein isolation, whether from archive material or live cells. A system is needed that combines LCM with an integrated imaging workstation and that also can be used for cryosections, including FFPE tissue. It is desired where it can be performed even from standard glass slides, e.g. archived material.</p>
<p>Minimum Essential Characteristics:</p>
<p>&bull;	Shall be a laser pressure catapulting enabled instrument<br />&bull;	Shall allow for contact-free and contamination-free sample extractions<br />&bull;	Shall have an inverted microscope (motorized)<br />&bull;	Shall have a robotic mover for automated cell harvesting and sorting of multiple microdissected specimens simultaneously.<br />&bull;	 Shall have a full range of objectives from low to high: 4X-100X<br />&bull;	Shall have digital cameras for fluorescence, bright field, and multi-channel fluorescence <br />&bull;	Shall have a workstation, monitor(s), and software</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Special Operations Command - Contracting Office, located at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, is conducting market research to determine the existence of interested sources capable of providing all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF) Training Support to provide role player and training support for the assessment, selection, and training conducted by the 1st Special Warfare Training Group (SWTG). The required training support is for field and situational training exercises and provides the depth and realism necessary to portray an adaptable training environment that focuses on achieving a desired outcome. In-role instruction during training events is provided by subject matter experts, which allows for a free-play exercise that is reactive to the performance of the student and allows them a guided experiential learning event to unfold so that each exercise becomes a unique learning environment specifically suited to the performance and capabilities of the student, as specified in the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>This IS NOT a request for proposals, but instead a market research method to determine interested sources prior to issuing the solicitation. The anticipated period of performance is a one-month phase-in, an 11-month base period, plus four (4) one-year ordering periods. The purpose of this notice is to ascertain interest within industry, and to obtain voluntary limited capability information of those interested sources. The Government anticipates the issuance of an unrestrictive, full and open competitive solicitation, to include robust subcontracting plan requirements. Therefore, the Government is also seeking input from the Small Business community regarding recommended subcontracting goals. Information provided is strictly voluntary.</p>
<p>If you are an interested source and capable of fulfilling this requirement, please provide the following:</p>
<p>1) Company name and Point of Contact; <br />2) DUNS number and CAGE code; <br />3) Socioeconomic Status (to include 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.), if applicable; <br />4) Security Clearance Level; and <br />5) A brief Statement of Capability (no more than 10 pages); which responds to the following questions, demonstrates the ability to meet the requirements specified in the PWS, and includes any Past Performance information on Government contracts of similar size and scope within the past three (3) years.</p>
<p>1. Discuss your company's ability to provide subject matter expert role players that have operational experience coupled with years of instructor experience that are capable of effectively teaching in-role instruction, and understand how to engage students at the appropriate level of intensity and then adjust responses based on the performance of the student.</p>
<p>2. Discuss your company's ability to provide a training facility, to include four (4) village sites/ locations with 8 to 10 stick built structures on a sufficient tract of land that can be used to replicate a variety of cultural locations. This facility will be used as an alternate target/ training facility that will provide variety and challenge students in numerous cultural situations, scenarios, and assessments. A surrounding road network is required on the track of land to facilitate convoy movement procedures for students to utilize in route to specified targets. The village sites/ locations and track of land should be within a 5-10 mile radius of Camp Mackall.</p>
<p>3. Explain your company's capacity and technical ability to support a Training Management Office (TMO) to serve as a primary training staff element of the 1st SWTG that will consist of a Field Team and a Support Element. The TMO will manage the Comprehensive Training Environment (CTE) for all ARSOF training conducted by 1st SWTG, and provide training support to include program management, planning, scenario development, dilemma development, script writing, cultural expertise, supply actions, logistics management, maintenance, and repair support as defined in the PWS.</p>
<p>4. Provide your company's experience and technical ability in planning, staffing and conducting multiple training courses simultaneously, as detailed within the PWS.</p>
<p>5. The magnitude of this requirement may require many business concerns to team, partner, and/or subcontract with other business concerns (large and small). Please submit any recommendations regarding subcontracting requirements for small businesses.</p>
<p>No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. No feedback will be provided regarding individual capability statements. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and/or any follow-up information requests.</p>

Their prototype was then developed into a production version for BOP and has been well received by users. This knowledge and expertise of the current application, environment, and infrastructure make them the only source reasonably available. This requirement is for a base period of nine (9) months and two (2) one-year option years. This notice of intent is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a request for offers. The proposed contract action is for services which the Government intends to solicit only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to this requirement by providing written notification to the point of contact (POC) no later than 12:00 pm (noon) ET, October 29, 2018. Supporting evidence must be furnished in detail to demonstrate the interested party's capabilities to perform the requirement. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be submitted via e-mail to Arlene Dee Carlson, arlene.carlson@usdoj.gov. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<p>RELATIONSHIPS</p>
<p>The incumbent reports to and receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the INL/Kabul Justice Program Team Lead and Deputy Program Team Lead. The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.</p>
<p>The incumbent coordinates and communicates with the INL/Kabul Justice and Corrections Advisors, and the INL/AP Rule of Law and Corrections Teams. The incumbent's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the missions of INL.</p>
<p>The Grants Officer's Representative (GOR) is delegated the authority to act for the Grants Officer in matters concerning technical clarification, oversight, inspection and, after concurrence by the Grants Officer, acceptance of Grantee performance under the grant, including preparation of receiving reports, approvals, and the authorization of progress payments when appropriate. The GOR will coordinate all work with the Grantee and review Grantee's performance at significant stages of its development.</p>
<p><br />DELIVERABLES/REPORTS</p>
<p>Deliverables are required under this PSC and shall include: monthly status reports, monthly evaluation of Grantee performance, quarterly Grant Officer Representative reports related to the respective grant, special reports when required, and a "Completion of Assignment Report," which shall be a comprehensive review of the projects in which the contractor was involved.</p>
<p>Each report shall include a critique of and recommendations for the various projects. The Completion of Assignment Reports are due no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of this contract. The Personal Service Contractor shall submit two (2) copies of each report as required to the following:</p>
<p>1.	INL/Kabul Director(s); and<br />2.	INL/Kabul Justice Program Team Lead.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 4, the above referenced documents shall be incorporated and copies stored in the PSC's hard file under Section V., Tab E - Receiving Reports.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall prepare and submit two (2) copies of each technical report required by the schedule of this contract (e.g. progress reports, final reports, etc.) to the Embassy INL Section and to the Program Officer, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Department of State, Washington, D.C. The title page of all reports forwarded pursuant to this paragraph shall include a descriptive title, the author's name(s), contract number, project number, and title, contractor's name, name of the State Department project office, and the publication or issuance date of the report.</p>
<p>When preparing reports, the Contractor shall refrain from using elaborate artwork, multicolor printing, and expensive paper/binding, unless it is specifically authorized in the Contract Schedule. Wherever possible, pages should be printed on both sides using single spaced type.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />The Advisor develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and GIRoA can be complicated.<br />Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high-level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.<br />Physical Demands<br />In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however travel in and around Afghanistan provinces is possible. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty, windy, and polluted environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty or polluted environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>GUIDELINES<br />Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted legal principles and theories. In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies. The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.</p>
<p><br />GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT<br />The PSC shall be able to use a furnished office space, a computer, office telephone, and other supplies needed for job requirements. This property will be owned and maintained by the Department of State.</p>

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)<br />Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>
<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com.<br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care.<br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access.

<SUBJECT>NASA Announcement of New Program Element Appendix added to  Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES):  C.28 Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads
<SOLNBR>NNH18ZDA001N-LSITP
<CONTACT>Sarah Noble, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Email Sarah.Noble-1@nasa.gov
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announces the addition of <strong>Program Element Appendix C.28 Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads (LSITP)</strong> to the omnibus NASA Announcement of Opportunity entitled Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2018 (NNH18ZDA001N). C.28 LSITP solicits flight payloads that do not require significant additional development. Investigations are sought that address the science goals of any of the four divisions (Planetary, Earth Science, Heliophysics, Astrophysics) of the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) as well as Strategic Knowledge Gaps of the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) or any technology demonstration goals of the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) that advance capabilities for science, exploration, or commercial development of the Moon. <br /> <br />This ROSES element invites proposals for complete, Principal Investigator-led science instrument and technology investigations. The term "complete" encompasses all of the investigation phases including project initiation, payload preparation, payload integration, payload operations, scientific and engineering analysis of the mission data, publication of results, and final dissemination of the data including delivery to NASA's archive.<br /> <br />This call is specifically geared towards small payloads that can be ready quickly in order to meet the immediate need for payloads for early Commercial Lunar Payload Services flights. We are interested in flight spares, engineering models, modified off-the-shelf payloads, student hardware or any other hardware that can credibly meet the aggressive timeline required. Future calls for lunar payloads will occur at regular intervals for later missions. We anticipate that the next call will be released in approximately one year.<br /> <br />This program element uses a two-step proposal submission process in which a mandatory Step-1 (preliminary) proposal must be submitted by an Authorized Organizational representative. Mandatory Step-1 proposals are due November 19, 2018, and the due date for Step-2 proposals is January 17, 2019.
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>
<p>It is anticipated that awards will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts managed by Planetary Missions Program Office at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.</p>
<p>Questions concerning this program element may be directed to Sarah Noble at <strong>Sarah.Noble-1@nasa.gov</strong>.</p>

Any acquisition resulting from this cascading set-aside will be from such a concern as follows 1st Tier Small Business Indian Firms<br />2nd Tier Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses <br />3rd Tier Certified Hub-Zone Small Businesses<br />4th Tier Small Disadvantage Businesses<br />5th Tier All other Small Business Concerns, all other Small Business Concerns.

Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe or "Native" as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601). Indian Economic Enterprise (Firm) means a sole enterprise, partnership, corporation, or other type of business organization owned, controlled, and operated by: (1) One or more Indians (including, for the purpose of sections 301 and 302 of Public Law 94-437, former or currently federally recognized Indian tribes in the State of New York); or (2) By an Indian firm (as defined in paragraph (1) of this definition); or (3) A nonprofit firm organized for the benefit of Indians and controlled by Indians (see 326.601(a)).

Klimo, Staefa MS2000, Smart1, Smart2, MS-DOS, and UNIX hardware and software are beyond their useful life, and new replacement parts/factory support are no longer available making it difficult to recover when failures occur. In addition to expired support, the older MS-DOS and UNIX operating systems create a Cybersecurity risk and must be replaced with current DDC technologies. The NiagaraAX Framework is nearing end-of-life and all hardware and software must be transitioned to Niagara4, keeping with manufacturer best practices.</p>
<p>To help JPL understand the competitive environment, we invite firms that are or may be interested in competing for this opportunity to respond to this Request for Information (RFI) by informing JPL of your company's interest and to comment, question, or recommend on the areas elaborated below.

The upgraded and new controls shall be integrated into the existing Niagara4 Supervisor along with providing a custom Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Dashboards for system monitoring, operation, fault detection diagnostics, and energy analytics for all buildings listed in Exhibit A. The project scope shall include the integration of several existing building metering devices into the existing Niagara4 Framework for energy monitoring and analysis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Anticipated Mandatory Qualification Critieria</strong></span>:<br />All interested parties and prospective bidders must show evidence of meeting specific Mandatory Qualification Criteria. The Proposer, shall:</p>

<p>Code and Description: U - Training Services<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.</p>
<p>Synopsis/Solicitation N0017819R4039 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to fulfill this requirement; however, the Government reserves the right to not award any BPA and does not guarantee any order placements. The resultant BPA award will be a total of five (5) years to include a base year plus four (4) option years. The Government is obligated only to the extent of the authorized orders made under the BPA.</p>
<p>Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements. All calls/orders must be acknowledged by the selected vendor in order to be retained on the BPA calling list. The Government will not be issuing a formal Request for Proposal because this notice will result in a BPA. In addition, the Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice.</p>
<p>This Synopsis/Solicitation is open to all business concerns; however, in accordance with FAR 19.501, the Governments' intent is to establish BPAs with small businesses. In the event there aren't enough responses from responsible, capable small businesses, then large business responses will be considered. Individual call numbers shall not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $250,000. Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 will be utilized. The Government reserves the right to add/delete vendors at any time throughout the life of the BPA. There is no minimum or maximum Government obligation.</p>
<p>Please include the total price for the base year and all option years. In addition, include the individual cost for each of the classes at each specific location. See Statement of Objectives for estimated number of courses and locations. Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) will be utilized for award in accordance with FAR Part 12. The order will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>Responsibility determination will also precede issuance of a BPA and will be conducted in accordance with FAR 9.104. Interested parties are encouraged to address the seven elements of responsibility contained in FAR 9.104 and to complete FAR Clause 52.219-1.</p>
<p>The BPA will be issued based on the criteria outlined in Attachment B. FAILURE TO SUPPLY THE REQUESTED INFORMATION WILL AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO BE AWARDED A BPA.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award, firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors may obtain information on registration in SAM by calling 866-606-8220, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Quote is due 08 November 2018, no later than 10:00 a.m. EST with an anticipated award date by 30 November 2018. Questions and responses regarding this synopsis/solicitation may be submitted by e-mail to mirenda.robertson@navy.mil prior to the RFQ closing. Email should reference Synopsis/Solicitation Number <br />N0017819R4039 in the subject line.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">The President&rsquo;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Initiative is the largest commitment ever by a nation toward an international health initiative for a single disease. The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (S/GAC) is responsible for implementing PEPFAR. To control and ultimately end the HIV/AIDS epidemic, collective gains must be expanded and sustained. Led by S/GAC&rsquo;s strategic vision, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">PEPFAR 3.0 &ndash; Controlling the Epidemic: Delivering on the Promise of an AIDS-free Generation</em>, PEPFAR is collecting and using data in the most granular manner (disaggregated by sex, age, and at the site level) to do the right things, in the right places, and right now within the highest HIV-burdened populations and geographic locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The PEPFAR program in South Africa (FY 18 level: $575.3 million) combines the talents of staff members and operational partners from the Department of State (DOS), Department of Health and Human Services (including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Peace Corps, to implement an integrated HIV/AIDS program. These entities have come together to create a program that supports activities in South Africa and allows for a rapid, unprecedented expansion of programs and services. This expansion takes into account expected inputs from the Global Fund, other donors and the Government of South Africa (GSA) itself. While the GSA and donors, including the United States, strive to work toward epidemic control, the scope, magnitude and urgent focus on results of the PEPFAR program create challenges and pressures due to differing perspectives, interests and agendas of the diverse implementing partners.</span></p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. <br />Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

PROJECT INFORMATION 

The mission of the Veterans Affairs Saint Louis Health Care System (VASTLHCS) is to provide the highest quality health care to our nation s veterans. In order to accomplish this mission, VASTLHCS  Facility Engineering Service (FES) intends to partner with an Architect/Engineer A/E or Engineer Firm for a design completion to conduct a Physical Security Assessment in accordance with VA's PSDM (Physical Security Design Manual) and additional supplemental guidance published by VA for VA owned and leased facilities at the VA Saint Louis Healthcare System. 


SCOPE OF WORK

The Prime contractor shall have the capability to provide Basic Professional Services as delineated in the Scope of Work. As part of the Basic Professional Services, FES expects the following primary A/E disciplines to be included: The specific disciplines which will be included are Architects, Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Structural Engineers, Industrial Hygienists, Estimators, CAD operators, Project Managers, LEED Consultant, Fire Protection Engineer, and Interior Designer.). 

Existing Conditions:  The PSDM s contain the physical security standards for improving the protection of mission critical and life safety facilities of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Mission Critical facilities are those required to continue operation during a natural or manmade extreme event. Life-safety protected facilities shall include all VA facilities designated as not mission critical. Guidance found on Real Property Policy Memorandum 2018-02 applies to all leased facilities. This assessment will include both owned and leased facilities for the VA Saint Louis Healthcare System.

Project Intent: Architect and Engineering ( A/E ) services are needed for design completion and construction period services for the construction project to  Conduct Physical Security Assessment .
 
 The PSDM s contain the physical security standards for improving the protection of mission critical and life safety facilities of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Mission Critical facilities are those required to continue operation during a natural or manmade extreme event. Life-safety protected facilities shall include all VA facilities designated as not mission critical. Guidance found on Real Property Policy Memorandum 2018-02 applies to all leased facilities. This assessment will include both owned and leased facilities as identified on Attachment A,  List of VA Leased Facilities , and Attachment B,  List of VA Owned Buildings . 

The physical security of facilities requires the use of concentric levels of control and protection to provide progressively enhanced levels of security to deter, prevent, detect, delay, and respond to threats in the protection of assets. The concept of concentric levels of control is to protect the central asset behind layers of security measures such that it is least exposed to the threats. Where a single line of defense might be easily breached, the concentric levels approach offers redundancy in lines of defense that is less likely to be breached. 
VA also follows the principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED, see www.cpted.net). CPTED strategies include elements of natural surveillance, natural access control, and natural territorial reinforcement. CPTED strategies are to be considered by the contractor in the development of recommendations tasked below to create and enhance the concentric circles or layers of security protection. 

The SOW for this task order organizes the VA PSDM concepts for existing campus/buildings into 3 tasks based on the  Point of Control  level and applicable PSDM concept chapters 3-10 for existing buildings. 

General Scope Tasks: 
Task 1   PSDM  Point of Control  levels 1 and 2: The first objective of the physical security assessment is to compare and develop a gap analysis of existing building and site conditions as they relate to the VA s PSDM s first and second level  points of control . The assessment will be made through document review and data gathering, owner interviews, and guided walkthrough non-invasive visual inspections addressing each of the applicable PSDM concepts. The document review will be based on VA provided Facilities Condition Assessments (FCA s), existing building data, past security assessments, current Capital Plans (SCIP and Master Plans), existing as-built building drawings, Site Plans, and Google Earth building visual analyses. Interviews will be scheduled and coordinated with required VA staff to obtain compliance knowledge prior to visual inspections. The contractor s visual inspection team will be accompanied by appropriate VA staff such as engineering and police. This task will apply to both owned and leased facilities identified in Attachment A & B. 

Task 2   PSDM  Point of Control  levels 3-5: The second objective of the physical security assessment is to compare and develop a gap analysis of existing building conditions as they relate to the VA s PSDM s third through fifth  points of control . This assessment will be conducted through document review, data gathering, and owner interviews. A physical inspection is not required for these PSDM concepts. The document review will be based on VA provided Facilities Condition Assessments (FCA s), existing building data, past security assessments, current Capital Plans (SCIP and Master Plans), existing as-built building drawings, Site Plans, and Google Earth building visual analyses. Interviews will be scheduled and coordinated with required VA staff to obtain compliance knowledge. If as part of the document review and interview process, its determined sufficient information does not exist to determine a gap with the PSDM concepts, the contractor will flag the applicable PSDM concept for the need of a future assessment. This task will apply only to  owned  buildings identified in Attachment B. 

Task 3   Structural Analysis: There are sections of the VA PSDM requiring certain existing building or site components meet specified test levels, blast and or structural 
calculations. The VA is not requesting anti-ram testing, deflection calculations or testing, blast load calculations, or any other required structural system calculations. Where such items are specified in the VA PSDM, the risk assessments specified under Task 1 and Task 2 above will be based on a desk top audit of any related VA provided information; and the limits of the non-invasive visual walkthrough specified under Task 1. Structural Analysis by a qualified structural engineer will be limited to providing high level input into the recommendations associated with Task 1 only which focuses on protection of the building exteriors from blast and vehicular ramming threats. 
The PSDM has been interpreted that Progressive Collapse review is not required for existing buildings. To address potential risk associated with the VA s PSDM Progressive Collapse requirements, analysis to be performed under Task 3 of this SOW will be limited to the development of a list of high risk owned and leased buildings based on a VA provided list of buildings that have not had a previous seismic study and that are more than one floor. The contractor will develop a list of these buildings and develop recommendations in the summary report limited to those that would enhance building perimeter protection. 

Specific Scope Tasks: 
Members of the A/E Analysis Team: The contractor shall form a project team to work with VA representatives to create the VA/A-E Analysis Team, which shall include, at a minimum, Risk Analyst, Architect, Physical Security expert, and VA Planning and Engineering representatives. The Plan shall include their titles, roles, and contact information.
Gap Analysis and Recommendations: In support of Task 1 and 2 above, Contractor shall record and identify gaps and vulnerabilities between existing conditions and the PSDM concepts. The contractor shall establish corrective action recommendations to be taken when buildings are deemed to be at risk or non-compliant with current PSDM s.

Master Plan Updates: Contractor shall create an Annex to the facility Master Plan at each major facility/healthcare system incorporating the findings of the risk assessment into the facility master plan. The Contractor shall compare all recommended corrective actions to the most recent SCIP Action plan and existing Master Plan and develop a report demonstrating additional projects that need to be added in SCIP Master Plans. The facility will be responsible for entering any needed projects into their Master Plans and SCIP plans. The annex will be a hard copy binder that includes the Campus Site Diagram, risk assessment findings, Task 3 high risk list of buildings for Progressive Collapse, recommended corrective actions, summary report, and list of projects to be added into the SCIP action plan. The A/E shall make recommendations to the VA representatives as to which deficiencies should be corrected through capital initiatives and which should be submitted for a waiver or exception. 
The A/E shall be solely responsible for the Task Order management, including all associated labor, equipment, materials, mailing costs, and inspections, to meet the requirements of the study project. The A/E shall further provide meeting minutes for all meetings held under this study project. 

Data Gathering and  Kickoff  Meetings: 
The VA Contracting Officer (CO), VA Contracting Officer Representative (COR), and Contractor shall conduct a post award  Kickoff  meeting at the facility to discuss and develop a process and checklist for data gathering, collection of existing materials, and drawings. The statement of work will be reviewed and the Contractor shall identify any questions or other issues which need to be addressed in the Task Order before contractor begins the study. The Facility Team shall work collaboratively with the Contractor to provide data required with sufficient detail, in an appropriate format, and in a timely manner to complete the studies, surveys, and analyses.

<p>The 2019 Bulk Fuel Additives procurement purchase program was originally synopsized under the number SPE602-18-R-0719 on October 2, 2018, however changes were made that required in EBS that automatically made a change to the solicitation number used for this requirement.

For Continental (US) CONUS locations, the delivery method used is tank truck. The specific details will be included within the schedule of the solicitation by product and location. The total estimated quantity is as follows:</p>
<p>FSII - 3,887,000 USG <br />NSN: 6850-01-057-6427<br />MIL-DTL-85470B dated 1 June 1999</p>
<p>CLA - 12,000 USG<br />NSN: 9140-01-628-6264<br />MIL-PRF-25017H (1) dated 4 August 2011</p>
<p>LIA - 80,000 USG<br />NSN: 9140-01-604-2853<br />MIL-PRF-32490 dated 25 February 2014</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>1. The CLA additive is a fuel-soluble corrosion inhibitor/lubricity improver additive for use in aviation turbine fuel, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, and related petroleum products. It is defined by MIL-PRF-25017. Awards will be made only for products that are, at the time of award of contract, qualified and included in the Qualified Products List (QPL) No. 25017 which can be found at http://qpldocs.dla.mil/.</p>
<p>2. The LIA additive is one of two grades of diesel lubricity improver additives that are used in naval distillate fuels conforming to MIL-DTL-16884. It is defined by MIL-PRF-32490. All LIA products offered must be listed on the Qualified Products List (QPL) to be considered for award (link: http://qpldocs.dla.mil/). LIA products not on the QPL list will need to be vetted and approved. Please contact Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, ATTN: SEA 05S, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, SE, Stop 5160, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-5160 or emailed to CommandStandards@navy.mil for vetting process.</p>
<p>3. All offers of products FSII, CLA, LIA, must indicate the product name and product manufacturer in the offer being submitted. All offers with products indicated that are not manufactured by the offeror must include a Supply Commitment Letter with the offer to indicate/verify the offeror's ability to provide products of the type and quantity indicated within its offer. See Section L of the solicitation for the requirements of what must be included in the Supply Commitment Letter.</p>
<p>4. Colonial Pipeline, VA: In addition to the requirements for CLA appearing in Quality Assurance Provision (QAP) C30-2, CLA supplied to this location are required to meet one of the low temperature viscosity requirements specified below. This additional requirement for CLA is due to infrastructure capability restrictions at this location. This performance requirement must be met in order to ensure pumpability of the product at this location.</p>
<p>a) Dynamic viscosity 450 centipoise (cP) maximum at 0 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by ASTM test method D 2983, or</p>
<p>b) Kinematic viscosity 350 centistokes (cSt) maximum at 30 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by ASTM test method D 445.</p>
<p>5. United Arab Emirates Embargo of Qatar:</p>
<p>Due to the current Qatar embargo issued by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) issued a Notice to Mariner(s) stating that UAE ports will not allow ships to load any cargo from UAE destined for Qatar. The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFIC) has declined to issue written assurance that the Notice to Mariner(s) is not applicable to U.S. DOD cargo destined for Qatar. Therefore, all FSII bid line proposals with shipping points or utilizing supply points in UAE will NOT be evaluated to Qatar.</p>
<p>Offerors submitting FSII bid lines with shipping points or utilizing supply points located in nations who are participating in the Qatar Embargo (other than UAE) or are otherwise imposing additional restrictions on shipping product to Qatar must provide documentation from cognizant port authority or management verifying the ability to provide product for delivery to Qatar. If sufficient documentation is not submitted, the bid lines will not be evaluated to Qatar. As of the date of this synopsis, the following countries, in addition to the UAE, have publically cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and/or are participating in the embargo: Bahrain, Comoros, Egypt, Maldives, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and Yemen. Please note that this list is neither exhaustive nor authoritative, and offerors are responsible for notifying DLA Energy whether the nations in which their shipping points or supply points are located are participating in the embargo or have some other similar restriction on shipping product to Qatar.</p>
<p>6.

Prime Contractors and subcontractors at any tier may verify their registration at https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/ by selecting the "Vendors Login" module and logging in with their user name and password. The offeror must be registered, approved, and eligible for installation access prior to award, and remain eligible for installation access for the life of the contract.<br /><br />The offeror is required to submit a listing of all proposed subcontractors, at all tiers, to the contracting officer with the submission of the proposal, and provide updates during the life of the contract when subcontractors are added or removed. If no subcontractors are expected to perform during the life of the contract, the offeror must submit a negative response to the Contracting Officer with its proposal. After award, the prime contractor must submit a negative response to the contracting officer at the beginning of each performance period.</p>
<p>7. The Military Cargo Preference Act of 1904:</p>
<p>Offerors will be required to adhere to the Military Cargo Preference Act of 1904 which requires that all supplies bought for the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps must be carried solely (100%) on U.S.-flag vessels except in certain circumstances. In addition, Contractors must give the government plenty of notice before a foreign-flag vessel can be waived into service. Specifically, DFARS 252.247-7023 states that the contractor must submit any request for use of other than U.S.-flag vessels in writing to the contracting officer at least 45 days prior to the sailing date necessary to meet its delivery schedules.</p>
<p>8. No Small Business set-asides will be offered for this procurement.</p>
<p>9. The Government reserves the right to make awards based on initial offered prices. Based on this, offerors should ensure all offered prices submitted with their initial offer are its best competitive and final price(s).</p>
<p>10. Proposals submitted electronically through a single e-mail must be no more than 10 MB in size. DLA Energy's mail server will reject messages larger than 10 MB.</p>
<p>11. There is an expectation that the solicitation will be posted in October 2018.</p>
<p>12. Please be reminded, that all offers must be submitted on the Offeror Submission Package (OSP). Please ensure that the OSP is completed in its entirety as it relates to the offeror's offer and that the product being offered must meet the specified requirements for the product itself and any location requirements identified within the line items. The product(s) being offered must be clearly identified in the OSP and indicate what the brand name and product identifier is for the product (i.e., CLA - TOLAD 351).</p>

A posting notice will be sent to the firms on the solicitation mailing list on the date the solicitation is issued and posted on the FedBizOpps webpage.

In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System.

(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

(i) technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement;

(ii) price;

(iii) past performance 

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

Technical capability will be evaluated by calculation of the SCA labor wage rates for maintenance and custodial services in Liberty County, GA. These wage rates will be applied to an estimate of 1 hour of labor per machine or latrine as quantified and iterated in the performance work statement.

Past Performance may be base on one or more of the following IAW FAR 13.106-2(b): (A) The contracting officers knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired; (B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies; (C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov; or (D) Any other reasonable basis. 

Price reasonableness will be based on competitive quotations or offers IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(1).

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

TITLE:
SERVICE to PERFORM Designated Operator (D.O.) Inspections for Fifteen (15) Underground Fuel Storage Tanks (UST).
BACKGROUND:
The Underground Fuel Storage Tanks house all the required fuel for the emergency generators that provide critical power for each building throughout the VA Long Beach Healthcare System (VALBHCS).  Tanks must be kept clean from all debris and water to ensure fuel will be able to generate emergency power at its full capacity in the event of a natural disaster.  All emergency generators rely on fuel provided to keep them operational and running.  There are several buildings that house critical care patients, patients on life support, and other lifesaving equipment to help monitor the status of every patient.  It is imperative to have emergency power for all buildings in the event of a loss of power to ensure all patients will have adequate care through specialized equipment being powered by the emergency power, that in the event of a loss of power, the emergency generators will kick-on and provide the adequate power for those equipment items.
In 1988, the Environmental Protectant Agency (EPA) promulgated the UST regulation - 40 CFR Part 280, which set minimum standards for UST systems and required owners and operators of existing UST systems to upgrade, replace or close them.  After 1988 UST regulation set deadlines for owners and operators who chose to upgrade or replace had to ensure their UST systems included spill and overfill prevention equipment and were protected from corrosion.  Owners and operators were required to monitor and inspect their UST systems.  Owners and operators were also required to demonstrate financial responsibility to pay for cleaning up releases for their AST(s) and UST(s).
The VALBHCS has various USTs and supportive AST day tanks on campus and to ensure compliance with the EPA UST regulation and other federal / state laws and regulations, specified periodic inspections, testing, and repairs by certified and qualified technicians is required.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 1 is to extend the due date pending additional information regarding item description.&nbsp; 10/18/2018.<br /><br /><br />Description:<br />
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, "Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items," as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a request for quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-100 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Public Notice (DPN) 20180824.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333991, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>Material Description:</p>
<p>The NSWC PHD is seeking to purchase Graco, Inc., products as described below. The parts must be new genuine Graco items. Brand Name Only. Used or refurbished is NOT acceptable.</p>
<p>We are requiring equipment that meets or economically exceeds the following specifications:</p>
<p>(1) Can be utilized for specialized Room Temperature Vulcanizing Rubber (RTV) Coating mixed with two different solvents in a specific mixture formula that will provide a 30:1 ratio of fluid pressure at a given air pressure. This ratio is extremely crucial and important so that the correct type of viscosity of the RTV mixture can be sprayed on to a surface with a required constant Dry Film Thickness reading.<br />(2) Air-Assisted model that allows for easier use to reach varying heights, altitudes, and diverse environmental conditions. <br />(3) Compatible for Metal surface painting in laboratory applications, remote testing facilities, or onboard ships.</p>
<p>The airless spray equipment cannot be used because of the current market design of the airless system spray rig configuration which will not let the RTV coating system have the proper fluid viscosity coming out the spray gun and being sprayed on the array face.</p>
<p>Plural Component spray equipment are not feasible because this equipment does not allow our RTV chemical mixture to chemically mix properly together for the reaction among the chemicals to interact because the chemicals are mixed closed to the spray gun tip.</p>
<p>The only type of equipment our spraying application is compatible with is an air assisted type equipment. The 30:1 is the pump ratio and motor ration that provides the proper air intake pressure and output spraying pressure and fluid viscosity.</p>
<p>For our application the closest model that meets the 30:1 ratio is the Graco D60, 30 Liter Spray Unit 36:1 with a DataTrak Control Unit for monitoring the volumetric flow of the RTV mixture. Without the ratio being close to the 30:1, then the formula of the RTV mixture has to be recalculated, reformulated, and retested each time a task is started. The follow items as described is compatible with our coating applications using RTV onboard ships and works with the chemical formulation and the fluid viscosity.</p>

Accordingly, prospective Offerors are directed to FAR Subpart 9.5 - Organizational Conflicts of Interest. The restrictions upon future contracting are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If the Contractor, through the performance of task orders issued under this contract, is required to develop specifications or statements of work that are to be incorporated into a solicitation, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described in that solicitation as a prime or any subcontractor under an ensuing NASA contract. This restriction shall remain in effect for a reasonable time, as agreed to by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor, sufficient to avoid unfair competitive advantage or potential bias (this time shall in no case be less than the duration of the initial production contract). NASA shall not unilaterally require the Contractor to prepare such specifications or statements of work under this contract.<br /><br />(2) To the extent work under this contract requires access to Government's and other contractor's "sensitive information" as defined in NFS 1852.237-72 Access to Sensitive Information. This also includes a vendor's proprietary, business confidential, or financial data; and/or may have access to Data and Information Technology (IT) systems, which may contain "sensitive information" as defined above, and as long as these data remain proprietary or confidential, the Contractor shall protect these data from unauthorized use and disclosure and agrees not to use them to compete with those other companies. Furthermore, during the term of the contract, Contractor personnel with access to "sensitive information" as defined in NFS 1852.237-72 Access to Sensitive Information; and/or may have access to Data and Information Technology (IT) systems, which may contain "sensitive information" as defined above, shall be prohibited from engaging in any marketing, consulting or advisory activities, business development, proposal preparation, or capture team that was formed for the purpose, of obtaining additional NASA work under existing contracts or new procurement opportunities. Prior to submitting an offer on any NASA solicitation, the Contractor shall provide a written certification to the Contracting Officer that no Contractor personnel with access to "sensitive information" as defined in NFS 1852.237-72 Access to Sensitive Information; and/or may have access to Data and Information Technology (IT) systems, which may contain "sensitive information" as defined above, under this contract participated on the marketing, consulting or advisory activities, business development, proposal preparation, or capture team that was formed to prepare the offer. The Contractor will be required to develop and implement a comprehensive OCI plan that includes training, execution of nondisclosure agreements, internal corporate firewalls, and oversight to protect against the disclosure of information or data obtained under this contract to other contractor employees that do not perform work on this contract.</p>
<p>NASA/GSFC also restates that potential Offerors shall possess a <strong>Secret</strong> level facility security clearance by the due date for receipt of proposals. No Offeror will be considered for award who does not have a <strong>Secret</strong> level facility security clearance in place by the due date for receipt of proposals. For proposals submitted as joint ventures, the facility clearance must be granted in the name of the joint venture and the joint venture CAGE code shall be provided.</p>

<SUBJECT>INPUTS TO THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR SCIENTIFIC DATA AND COMPUTING 
<SOLNBR>NNH18ZDA017L
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>110218
<CONTACT>Kevin Murphy, Science Mission Directorate, Email hq-smd-data-computing-rfi@mail.nasa.gov - Ellen Gertsen, Science Mission Directorate, Email hq-smd-data-computing-rfi@mail.nasa.gov
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for Inputs to the Science Mission Directorate Strategic Plan for Scientific Data and Computing (NNH18ZDA017L).
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>
<p>The NASA Science Mission Directorate requests information, comments and suggestions to assist in the development of a Strategic Plan for Scientific Data and Computing. RFI NNH18ZDA017L solicits input from all stakeholders, including but not limited to members of scientific community, academic institutions, other agencies, the private sector, professional societies, advocacy groups, the general public, and international collaborators.</p>
<p>The objective of the Strategic Plan for Scientific Data and Computing is to articulate a whole-of-SMD 5-year strategy that has four overall goals:<br />&#9679;	Improve discovery and access for all SMD data for immediate benefit to science data users and to improve the overall user experience, <br />&#9679;	Identify large-scale and cross-disciplinary/division science users and use cases to inform future science data system capabilities,<br />&#9679;	Enable strong theory programs that are firmly based on NASA's observations, and<br />&#9679;	Modernize science data and computing systems to improve efficiency and enable new technology and analysis techniques for scientific discovery and commercial use.</p>
<p>Currently SMD stores over 100 Petabytes (PB) of observational and model data. The Earth Science Division alone archives contain nearly 30PB of observational data and more than 70PB of model output. By 2023, the Earth Science archives will contain over 150PB of observational data with an annual growth rate of 50PB per year. Within 5 years, all four Science Divisions are projected to generate over 100PB of data per year and continue to grow rapidly as new missions are launched and new models are run. This anticipated growth of SMD's science archives presents unique opportunities for new scientific discovery as well as significant challenges for data management, curation, access, analysis, maintenance of provenance, and computing.</p>
<p>The Strategic Plan for Scientific Data and Computing is intended to span the range of activities within the Science Mission Directorate, including opportunities for cross-disciplinary science investigations. Respondents are therefore encouraged to think broadly about future capabilities and needs, and we encourage members of all fields of NASA science, engineering, industry, and academia to respond to this RFI in order to ensure a range of views.</p>
<p>NASA will use responses to aid in programmatic decisions about future investments for data and computing, including partnerships with private sector and philanthropic organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is emphasized that this RFI is neither a Request for Proposal, nor an Invitation for Bid. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only; therefore, NASA does not plan to respond to the individual RFI responses. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Pursuant to FAR 52.215-3, entitled Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, this information is being made available for market research, information, and planning purposes. This RFI is subject to review or cancellation at any time and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract. The Government will not pay for the information submitted in response to this request, and respondents will not be notified of the results.</p>
<p>This RFI is open to responses from all parties including commercial entities, international organizations, academia, NASA Centers, and other government agencies. This RFI may be downloaded from NSPIRES at <strong>https://nspires.nasaprs.com/</strong> by searching on NNH18ZDA017L or directly accessed at: <strong>https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={B896B39A-F430-1916-2247-B791CE3D5FBF}&amp;path=open</strong>. Responses will be accepted only when submitted via NSPIRES by 11:59 PM Eastern Time on November 2, 2018.&nbsp;<strong> Responses provided by email, mail or other means will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> be accepted. </strong></p>

<DESC>The objective of this acquisition is to acquire the services needed to the agency consolidated end-user services (ACES) requirement. The ACES requirement will develop a continued long-term outsourcing arrangement with the commercial sector to provide and manage the vast majority of NASA's personal computing hardware, Agency standard software, mobile IT services, peripherals and accessories, associated end-user services, and supporting infrastructure.<br /><br />The nature of NASA's program implementation model requires extensive cross-Center collaboration, which is vital to the planning, design, and development of mission-related capabilities and technology in the future. NASA, therefore, requires a seamless technical IT infrastructure to ensure interoperability both within programs and across Centers and facilities. The ACES requirement will continue to develop a long-term outsourcing arrangement with the commercial sector to provide and manage the vast majority of NASA's personal computing hardware, Agency standard software, mobile IT services, peripherals and accessories, associated end-user services, and supporting infrastructure. These are the predominant service components of the performance work statement (PWS) necessary to support the ACES requirement throughout NASA headquarters, the ten NASA field centers, and other performance sites.<br /><br />NASA/NSSC intends to issue a sole source contract to Enterprise Services LLC (ES). The sole source contract is necessary to prevent expensive and time-consuming renegotiation and to provide continuous coverage of the mission critical end-user services until the completion of the competitive NEST follow-on procurement. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), it has been determined that only the original source in the case of the follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services will satisfy agency requirements. Awarding to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement. NASA/NSSC will be the procuring center for this effort.
<p>The Government intends to acquire commercial items and services using the provisions, clauses and procedures prescribed in FAR 12.</p>
<p>Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html .</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government and respondents will not be entitled to payment of direct or indirect cost incurred in responding to this RFI. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), Easter Region Acquisition Division (ERAD), located in Norfolk, VA is conducting market research for the purpose of assessing the current and near future marketplace and potential vendors capable of conducting a Proof of Concept for the Ship Automated Identification System (AIS) to provide Weather Reporting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for Ship AIS Weather Reporting capability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This RFI is a request for interested parties to describe their technical capabilities and demonstrated tools, processes, and service capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>All interested contractors are requested to provide written response to the questions below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist NWS in determining the potential levels of interest, adequacy of competition, and market maturity and technical capabilities within the business community to provide the required capabilities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Requested Information</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Government welcomes industry comments, questions and suggestions that will aid it in understanding industry capabilities, developing its acquisition strategy and finalizing the PWS. In an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI, vendors are encouraged to schedule one-on-one information exchanges with the Government. One of the principal outcomes of vendor/government dialog will be to ensure that alternate approaches that may reduce cost and risk are considered in the follow-on procurement. The Government may therefore utilize the information provided to refine its acquisition strategy to maximize competition among viable acquisition alternatives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">It is not the Government's intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public. The information submitted by vendors during the market research period may be used by the Government in preparing its RFP and finalizing the PWS, provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.</span></p>

<p>The objective of this RFI is to assess industry's ability to provide a materiel solution within an accelerated timeframe at an affordable cost.  The Navy is seeking information to help determine the interest, technical and manufacturing capabilities, technical quality of solutions, knowledge, experience level, and qualifications of industry to meet the Government's needs to develop and build a MUSV.  Additionally, the Navy is interested in technical, administrative, and business risks in pursuit of the desired solution.  The Navy has not yet determined the acquisition approach to MUSV.  NAVSEA issues this RFI to obtain industry input to support the Navy's Unmanned Maritime Systems Program Office (PMS 406) within Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants.  Respondents should identify their materiel solutions, as well as the cost drivers and timeframe, for providing those solutions.  Solutions that only cover a portion of the desired end product are welcome.  It is expected that some unmanned surface vehicle solutions will require modifications to support Navy payloads to be specified at a later date.  Navy is seeking the following in response to this RFI:</p>
<p>1.	What already designed and/or fielded vessels are available as a basis for design of a MUSV?</p>
<p>2.	What technically mature systems/subsystems are available to meet the needs of MUSV? What is the manufacturing capacity and timeline to build a new vessel if applicable?  What is the availability of existing vessels that can be repurposed for this mission if applicable?  What is the manufacturing capacity and timeline to modify an existing vessel to become compliant with desired requirements if applicable?</p>
<p>3.	What is the time frame for each of the following:</p>
<p>a.	Design of MUSV to incorporate a defined payload (with given Size, Weight, Power and Cooling requirements), fabrication of MUSV, contractor test of MUSV, and integration of future payloads after MUSV design is complete.  Include suggested methodologies enabling:</p>
<p>1)	program streamlining and acceleration<br />2)	manufacturing strategies, technologies and approaches for increased production and<br />3)	methodologies supporting warranty, vessel upgrade/modification, and maintenance support to the vessel after delivery.<br />b.	Conversion of existing vessels, if available, into a MUSV to incorporate a defined payload (with given Size, Weight, Power and Cooling requirements), contractor test of MUSV, and integration of future payloads after MUSV design is complete. Include suggested methodologies enabling:<br />1)	program streamlining and acceleration <br />2)	manufacturing strategies, technologies and approaches for increased production and<br />3)	methodologies supporting warranty, vessel upgrade/modification, and maintenance support to the vessel after delivery.</p>
<p>4.	If your solution delivers a vessel designed for manned operation, describe how the craft systems lend themselves to automation and/or remote monitoring and operation (i.e. fly by wire, existing monitoring systems, etc.)  If your solution is an autonomy system for a vessel designed for manned operation, or if your solution is an autonomous vessel, describe the autonomy architecture and capabilities.  For both solutions, describe sensory spectrums and associated data streams required to functionally operate the vessel.  Respond for autonomous operation ranging from Human delegated, to Human supervised and finally to Fully Autonomous, with focus to progressing towards the highest level of</p>
<p>5.	Using Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV), provide matrices (or equivalent) that compare the potential system and subsystems in your approach, technical maturity, performance and schedule trade-offs and risks associated with each system/subsystem.</p>
<p>6.	What are the primary complexity and cost drivers associated with MUSV as they relate to your approach?  Estimate Total rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate using FY19 dollars for the build of one MUSV.  Please provide your basis for cost as follows: Recurring and Non-recurring Costs (including design), and first unit cost.  If providing recommended sparing, logistics, and sustainment costs, break these out as separate items. <br /> <br />7.	Describe your expected labor learning curve in serial production of MUSV.  In particular, express the fifth unit's cost as a fraction of the first unit's cost, or provide a formula expressing the nth unit's cost as a function of first vessel cost and "n", the number of the vessel.</p>
<p>8.	In production, what would be the optimal interval between vessel deliveries for your organization?  How much cost efficiency could be provided to the Government on such a schedule compared to deliveries spaced 12 months apart?</p>
<p>9.	Specify trade space issues/concerns for technical capability, cost, and schedule.</p>
<p>10.	Specify what, if any, damage control systems are available (e.g., dewatering for flooding, inert gas flooding system for firefighting, etc.)</p>
<p>11.	Describe a logistics support strategy which could include contractor support for the initial craft in theatre for up to two years.</p>
<p>12.	The Navy is considering CLIN type FPI or FPP for this effort. Provide information on whether you would bid on this effort if either CLIN type is chosen.</p>

<DESC>NOTE: This Sources Sought/Request for Information is also posted under NAICS Codes (334511 and 541330) in order to reach all interested parties. Only one response is necessary for this announcement. This notice is for market research purposes only and does NOT constitute a request for proposal. This notice shall not be construed as a contract, a promise to contract, or as a commitment of any kind by the Government. The Government is NOT seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. <br /><br />This Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) notice is issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Program Executive Office (PEO) Unmanned and Small Combatants (USC), Unmanned Maritime Systems Program Office (PMS 406). The Navy is conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 to determine if sources exist that are capable of satisfying the Navy's anticipated program requirement for independently deploying Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicles (MUSVs). MUSVs are defined as vessels between 12 and 50 meters in length. NAVSEA is taking an accelerated approach with industry to leverage existing, manned or unmanned surface ship designs that can be designed and/or modified to rapidly deliver an unmanned surface ship capability.<br />In accordance with 10 U.S.C. Section 7309, no major component of the hull or superstructure of the MUSV may be constructed in a foreign shipyard.

The Threshold number of personnel during temporary manning is four, with an Objective of zero. Respondents are asked to state how many personnel their approaches would take, and which task drives that number.<br />The objective of this RFI is to assess industry's ability to provide a materiel solution within an accelerated timeframe at an affordable cost. The Navy is seeking information to help determine the interest, technical and manufacturing capabilities, technical quality of solutions, knowledge, experience level, and qualifications of industry to meet the Government's needs to develop and build a MUSV. Additionally, the Navy is interested in technical, administrative, and business risks in pursuit of the desired solution. The Navy has not yet determined the acquisition approach to MUSV. NAVSEA issues this RFI to obtain industry input to support the Navy's Unmanned Maritime Systems Program Office (PMS 406) within Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants. Respondents should identify their materiel solutions, as well as the cost drivers and timeframe, for providing those solutions. Solutions that only cover a portion of the desired end product are welcome. It is expected that some unmanned surface vehicle solutions will require modifications to support Navy payloads to be specified at a later date. Navy is seeking the following in response to this RFI:</p>
<p>1. What already designed and/or fielded vessels are available as a basis for design of a MUSV?</p>
<p>2. What technically mature systems/subsystems are available to meet the needs of MUSV? What is the manufacturing capacity and timeline to build a new vessel if applicable? What is the availability of existing vessels that can be repurposed for this mission if applicable? What is the manufacturing capacity and timeline to modify an existing vessel to become compliant with desired requirements if applicable?</p>
<p>3. What is the time frame for each of the following: <br />a. Design of MUSV to incorporate a defined payload (with given Size, Weight, Power and Cooling requirements), fabrication of MUSV, contractor test of MUSV, and integration of future payloads after MUSV design is complete. Include suggested methodologies enabling:<br />1) program streamlining and acceleration<br />2) manufacturing strategies, technologies and approaches for increased production and<br />3) methodologies supporting warranty, vessel upgrade/modification, and maintenance support to the vessel after delivery.<br />b. Conversion of existing vessels, if available, into a MUSV to incorporate a defined payload (with given Size, Weight, Power and Cooling requirements), contractor test of MUSV, and integration of future payloads after MUSV design is complete. Include suggested methodologies enabling:<br />1) program streamlining and acceleration <br />2) manufacturing strategies, technologies and approaches for increased production and<br />3) methodologies supporting warranty, vessel upgrade/modification, and maintenance support to the vessel after delivery.</p>
<p>4. If your solution delivers a vessel designed for manned operation, describe how the craft systems lend themselves to automation and/or remote monitoring and operation (i.e. fly by wire, existing monitoring systems, etc.) If your solution is an autonomy system for a vessel designed for manned operation, or if your solution is an autonomous vessel, describe the autonomy architecture and capabilities. For both solutions, describe sensory spectrums and associated data streams required to functionally operate the vessel. Respond for autonomous operation ranging from Human delegated, to Human supervised and finally to Fully Autonomous, with focus to progressing towards the highest level of</p>
<p>5. Using Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV), provide matrices (or equivalent) that compare the potential system and subsystems in your approach, technical maturity, performance and schedule trade-offs and risks associated with each system/subsystem.</p>
<p>6. What are the primary complexity and cost drivers associated with MUSV as they relate to your approach? Estimate Total rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate using FY19 dollars for the build of one MUSV.

<div><br /></div>
The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Commercial Items contract to Rolls-Royce Corporation, 450 South Meridian Street Indianapolis IN 46225-1103. This contract is for the procurement of up to forty (40) Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) 100 Class Craft Rolls-Royce MT7 Engines and ten (10) Rolls-Royce MT7 Engine Installation Parts Kits. This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  There is only one source that can provide these supplies because the Rolls-Royce MT7 Engine is a Commercial Item available to both military and commercial entities. Rolls-Royce is the sole manufacturer of the MT7 Engine and the MT7 Engine Installation Parts. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate under FAR Part 12 Commercial Items procedures. <br /> <br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Rolls-Royce Corporation directly.  This announcement is published for informational purposes only. <br />

<div><strong>HOW TO OFFER:&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at</div>
<div>https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in</div>
<div>response to RLP 19-REG04. In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space</div>
<div>requirement.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the &ldquo;Register to Offer Space&rdquo; link and follow the</div>
<div>instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in</div>
<div>the &ldquo;HELP&rdquo; tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any</div>
<div>&ldquo;Open Period&rdquo;.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Refer to AAAP RLP</div>
<div>paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to</div>
<div>allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space</div>
<div>requirement. Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month)</div>
<div>and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This FBO advertisement is hereby incorporated into the RLP 19-REG04 by way of reference as an RLP</div>
<div>attachment.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based</div>
<div>upon the requirements in this FBO advertisement and in the RLP requirements package found on the</div>
<div>AAAP website. During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing</div>
<div>offers. Offerors can draft an offer at any time; however, you can only submit an offer during the Open</div>
<div>Period.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The offered space must comply with the requirements in this FBO advertisement and RLP 19-REG 04</div>
<div>and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements</div>
<div>for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance</div>
<div>with the terms of the Lease. The Lease and all documents that constitute the Lease package can be</div>
<div>found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2018, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will</div>
<div>allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2019 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the</div>
<div>data manually. Please be sure to review FY19 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP</div>
<div>Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your</div>
<div>space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates&rsquo; tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be</div>
<div>copied.</div>

The JPD-IND is a rugged Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Battlefield Dosimeter that replaces legacy radiological dose measurement devices. JPD-IND will provide a joint solution that eliminates parts obsolescence, increases capability, reduces life-cycle costs, and addresses Operation TOMODACHI lessons learned for common, interoperable equipment with adequate sensitivity and common units of measure, replacing the legacy systems, the PDR-75/DT-236 and the PDR-75A/DT-236A series systems. The JPD-IND system is envisioned to include a real-time, self-indicating dosimeter unit with inherent measurement and display capabilities, and to be worn on the wrist or chest. Data transfer is will occur via connectivity to existing situational awareness and mission command systems and tactical networks.

<DESC>FEMA has Mission Assigned NIST to develop a rapid windfield estimate for Hurricane&nbsp;Michael as it made landfall. FEMA uses this windfield data as inputs to their Hazus Hurricane loss model, to estimate casualties, damage, sheltering needs, and other storm impacts. This is a life safety priority for FEMA, as they use the outputs from the Hazus model the help plan their response and position and allocate resources.
<p>ARA's hurricane modeling code to develop the windfield maps is proprietary, although the methodology has been well published in the technical peer-reviewed literature. <br /><br />Their hurricane windfield model is built into the Hazus Hurricane loss estimation model, which ARA developed for FEMA a decade or so ago. Other hurricane windfield models have been tried as inputs to Hazus, but they do not perform as accurately as those developed by ARA, which have been extensively validated as part of the Hazus development program.<br /><br />The Government, through both NIST and FEMA contracts, has already invested a several hundred thousand dollars specific to hurricane modeling for Hazus and also for rapid windfield modeling capabilities during the 2017 hurricane season. There is no other known source for they type of rapid hurricane wind field modeling needed.</p>

<ARCHDATE>11302018
<DESC>The government seeks to award a sole-source contract to Upstart Inc. for technical support for testing and integration of the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Power Enclosure for the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS) MK V system. The SOFC prototype was designed and developed by Protonex Technology Corporation (Protonex), a subsidiary of Ballard Power Systems (Ballard) under Contract H9222-17-C-0007. Ballard has subsequently sold Protonex to Upstart Inc. along with all of the intellectual property (IP) rights associated with the SOFC.
<p>The testing, and integration of the custom-built prototype SOFC from Upstart, Inc. is a logical continuation of the work performed by Protonex. Competing the work creates significant challenges for potential competitors as the IP is owned by Upstart Inc., prohibitive capital investment requirements, and significant resources to prepare for and manage the estimated six-month effort. Additionally, the overall integration schedule of the SOFC into other MK V, of which the SFOC is a vital component, must be maintained.</p>
<p>Interested parities may submit their capabilities to perform this effort in writing to the identified point(s) of contact not later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on October 29, 2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition, based on responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
