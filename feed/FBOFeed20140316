<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address:<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive Room 1E136 Bethesda, MD 20892 <br /><br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541611 and the business size standard is $14 Million.<br /><br />Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />The period of performance is twelve (12) months from date of award plus one - one year option period.<br /><br />It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement. <br /><br /><strong>Description:</strong><br />The National Institute of Cancer (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), is anticipating awarding competitive contract to implement the continuation of the partner project agreements between the Research Center for Radiation Medicine (RCRM) of the Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the United States and between the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism (IEM) of the Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine and the NCI to provide financial management oversight for three NCI supported projects in Ukraine: follow-up for thyroid cancer and related activities in individuals exposed to radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident; field work for the case-control study of thyroid cancer in Chernobyl clean-up workers; and data collection for the case-control study of leukemia. <br /><br />The Chernobyl Research Unit (CRU), DCEG REB sponsors joint U.S.-Ukraine studies of health effects of the Chernobyl Accident. Currently, there are two partnership agreements supporting three collaborative U.S.-Ukraine epidemiological projects in Ukraine. These projects are 1) "Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident" (P004) undertaken at the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism (IEM), Kiev; 2) "Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases Among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident" (P003) at the Research Center for Radiation Medicine (RCRM), Kiev; and 3) "Thyroid Cancer among Chernobyl Cleanup Workers in Ukraine" (P003A) undertaken as a variation of the project name, "Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases Among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident" (see below) also at RCRM. <br /><br />The partnership agreement for "Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident" (P004) involves thyroid screening and other related tasks in a cohort of about 13,000 people who were exposed to post-Chernobyl radioactive fallout under age 20 years. The aim of this project is to assess early and late morphologic and functional changes in the thyroid glands of persons exposed at young ages to radiation from radioactive materials released as a consequence of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident. The cohort members have been undergoing diagnostic thyroid examinations since 1998. Under a rigid protocol approved by NCI, IEM staff carries out the field work to maintain contact with the cohort members and invite them to diagnostic thyroid examinations, which may include palpation, ultrasound scanning, thyroid hormone and other laboratory tests. These examinations are done at IEM or by a mobile team. If deemed necessary by the protocol, cohort members are referred to an expert endocrinologist at IEM for a fine-needle aspiration biopsy for diagnostic confirmation. Interview information collected by IEM regarding residential, health, diet and lifestyle history has been used for estimating radiation doses by an international expert group involving NCI. Follow-up is also performed on all subjects for thyroid cancer morbidity and mortality through linkage with the national cancer registry in Ukraine. The IEM is responsible for the tracing of cohort subjects, recording medical and other data, data processing, and database management and organizing analytical data for NCI. IEM collects fresh and/or archived samples for study by NCI genetic and genomic investigations. IEM also provides data management and quality control, services needed for radiation dose reconstruction to be undertaken by NCI and other dosimetry experts, and assist data analysis and manuscript preparations for NCI.<br /><br />The partnership project agreement for "Leukemia and Other Hematologic Diseases among Clean-up Workers in Ukraine Following the Chernobyl Accident" (P003) involves a case-control study of leukemia among clean-up workers carried out by RCRM staff. The objective of this study is to assess the risk of leukemia and other hematological cancers related to radiation exposure that the clean-up workers received during the recovery and clean-up operations after the accident. Data collection undertaken by RCRM is nearly completed, and major study results showing a significant risk of leukemia associated with radiation exposure have been published. The RCRM continues to provide additional data and/or biological samples for analyses performed by NCI. <br /><br />Recently, an amendment has been made to the above agreement with RCRM to add a case-control study of thyroid cancer in the same clean-up worker population, "Thyroid Cancer among Chernobyl Cleanup Workers in Ukraine" (P003A). Under the protocol approved by NCI, RCRM staff conducts field work to identify cases with thyroid cancer and non-cancer controls, interview them for radiation exposure information, and collect saliva samples for future genetic studies. In addition, under the protocol approved by NCI, RCRM acquire and store archival thyroid tumor tissues and other biological samples for NCI genetic research ("Tissue Archiving"). The RCRM also provides data management and quality control, services needed for radiation dose reconstruction to be undertaken by NCI and other dosimetry experts, and assist data analysis and manuscript preparations for NCI. <br /><br />In all three projects, NCI investigators are responsible for study design and methodologies while the contractor shall implement an un-interrupted continuation of these projects under the Partner Project Agreement, providing technical and financial management for the projects in Ukraine.<br /><br />As set forth in the agreement signed by the United States, Canada, Sweden and Ukraine, funds received by the Recipients (RCRM and IEM) in Ukraine from the NCI in connection with the contractors projects shall be excluded in determining the profits of the contractor for the purpose of tax liability and funds received by persons shall not be included in these persons taxable incomes. The allocation of intellectual property arising from the agreement and the responsibilities for protecting and exploiting such intellectual property have been negotiated between the Recipient and the Partner. Exploitation of results shall be limited to applications for peaceful purposes, and the Recipient and the NCI shall ensure that any results that could result in concerns over proliferations of weapons technology and transfer of sensitive technologies will be protected in accordance with Ukrainian laws and international agreements. <br /><br /><strong>Scope of Work:<br /></strong><br />The Contractor shall perform the following in accordance with Partner Project Agreement:<br /><br />1. Work with NCI, Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism (IEM) and Research Center for Radiation Medicine (RCRM) to develop a draft agreement for each project (P003, P003A and P004) to become effective&nbsp;April 20, 2014 through April&nbsp; 19, 2015, if none of the Options are exercised, or April 19, 2016, if any of the Options are exercised, describing the scope of the project that includes the project objectives, work plan, personnel plan, budget lines, and reports and deliverables to be submitted to NCI. <br />2.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is not a small business set-aside. Therefore, any responsible source may submit a quote.
<p>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Therefore, quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

<p>The Government is soliciting quotes for the purchase of 5.8Ghz PTP Terminal.</p>
<p>The Government intends on issuing a single order to the quoter that represents the overall best value to the Government. However, the Government does reserve the right to issue multiple awards if it is deemed in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>Award will be made in aggregate. Therefore, any offer received without all products priced will be excluded from competition.</p>
<p>Lowest Price Technically Acceptable will be used to determine the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>This is "Brand Name" or "Equal" procurement. The referenced brand name is not intended to be restrictive, but represent the minimum requirements of the Government. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics must be met in order for an "equal" item to be acceptable for award by the Government.</p>
<p>It is the quoter's responsibility to furnish sufficient information to the Government in order to determine acceptability of the quoted 'equal' item. Therefore, if an "equal" item is quoted, the quoter shall submit all technical specifications for the Government to review in order to determine technical acceptability.</p>
<p>Quoters are instructed to completely fill out the attached coversheet and return it along with your quote.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the "equal" item technical specifications or the required coversheet may result in your quote being considered non-responsive by the Government.</p>
