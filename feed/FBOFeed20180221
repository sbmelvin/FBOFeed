<DESC><strong>Pre-Solicitation Notice - M205 Tripod</strong><br /><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE of a proposed requirement regarding the M205 Lightweight Tripod (NSN: 1005-01-586-5702) for Heavy Machine Guns. The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey-Soldier Weapons (ACC-NJ-SW) on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW) intends to award a Single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Orders. The contract will include five (5) ordering periods to cover FY18 - FY22 Army and Department of Defense (DoD) M205 requirements. This requirement is 100% set aside for small business. The anticipated contract minimum is $630,000.00. The anticipated contract maximum is 19,024 M205 tripods. This notice of intent is NOT a request for draft or formal competitive proposals.<br /><br />The M205 Tripod is used with the M2/M2A1 Heavy Machine Gun and the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun and will be produced to a Government Technical Data Package (TDP). The M205 is an improved ground mount which will replace the heavier and larger M3 Tripod for ground mounting the M2/M2A1 .50 Caliber Machine Gun and MK19 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG). An integral Traverse and Elevation (T&amp;E) Mechanism is included as part of the M205 and provides controlled manipulation in both T&amp;E. The M205's primary mission is to provide a stable, easy to-use, mounting platform for the M2/M2A1 and MK19 for delivering controlled, sustained, and accurate fire at extended ranges to support combat operations in offensive and defensive roles.<br /><br />Any offeror awarded a contract resulting from the solicitation shall be required to conduct First Article Test(s) (FAT) and a Lot Acceptance Test(s) (LAT). A crucial aspect of FAT is a Live Fire Test requirement to be performed by the successful offeror(s). The Live Fire Test requirement(s) will be solely performed by the contractor. The awardee will be required to safely and securely store Government furnished machineguns,<br />ammunition, and equipment in order to be considered for award. The Firing Test requirement(s) will be outlined and included with the solicitation. The FAT and Lot Acceptance Test requirements will be outlined and included in the solicitation. Should a resulting contract be awarded, the First Article Sample would be submitted to the<br />Government 180 days after contract award, and monthly production deliveries would commence within 60 days after Government approval of the First Article Sample. Production deliveries would ramp up from 50 per month to 400 per month by the sixth (6) delivery. Delivery schedules for future orders will be establish at time of award.<br /><br />The Technical Data Package (TDP) for the M205 Tripod is categorized as Distribution D and is restricted accordingly. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.), as amended.<br />Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. This also applies to distribution of the TDP to all Subcontractors at every level. The manufacture of the M205 Tripod is restricted to within the United States and its Territories. Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of<br />the TDP. (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/for instructions and information). At time of the Request for Proposal (RFP), TDP requests shall be submitted in writting using AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire along with a signed DD 2345 Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement form, a fully executed Non Disclosure<br />and Non Use Agreement and a fully executed Shipping Request Form. All required documents will be provided at solicitation release. In order to provide the data to foreign subcontractors, offerors must apply for an export license. An offeror's delay in applying for a DD 2345 certification or an export license will not be a basis to extend<br />the closing date of any future request for proposal. Only contractors who have completed and signed the required documents as prescribed in the solicitation will be granted access to the technical data. Drawings will not be provided as part of this PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. At the conclusion of the solicitation process, all respondents in receipt of data will be required to complete a Certificate of Destruction notifying the USG that all data received in response to the solicitation have been destroyed.<br /><br />This PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Solicitation is planned to be issued within the 4th quarter of FY 17. The points of contact for this action are: Marcos Kamiyama, Contract Specialist, Email: marcos.g.kamiyama.civ@mail.mil and Molly Michaud, Contract Specialist, Email: molly.l.michaud.civ@mail.mil. NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.<br /><br />The Government will accept written questions by Email to marcos.g.kamiyama.civ@mail.mil and<br />molly.l.michaud.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>Description(s): General Services Administration (GSA), Great Lakes Region 5, announces an opportunity to acquire construction services for the OCIO RIC Relocation at the John C. Kluczynski Federal Building located at 230 S. Dearborn Street in Chicago, Illinois. This project will include standalone supplemental cooling and secure access in the John C.

The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $500,000 to $1,000,000. The NAICS code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Small Business Size Standard is $36.5 Million.
<p><br />Project Scope: The project shall include a complete demolition and rebuild to shell conditions for the existing RIC location, including removal of any mechanical systems above standard office requirements. The duration of the contract is 250 calendar days from Notice to Proceed to Final Completion. The "best value tradeoff process" will be utilized in this procurement for the evaluation of offers and the selection of the successful Offeror to receive the award. The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both the technical factors and the total evaluated price. For this procurement, the technical factors will be significantly more important than price. The technical factors will include past experience on similar projects, past performance and qualifications on similar projects, project management plan and experience of key personnel.</p>

Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "CONFIDENTIAL" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "CONFIDENTIAL" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS:" and "CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</p>
<p>6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "Confidential" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.</p>

<DESC>Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) is seeking sources to potentially provide Certified Athletic Trainer (AT) services for Marine Corps Operating Forces (OPFOR) and Entry Level Training (ELT) locations in support of the Sports Medicine and Injury Prevention (SMIP) Program at various locations within the contiguous United States (CONUS) and outside the contiguous United States (OCONUS).<br />Physical Training (PT) is a large component of how the Marine Corps readies personnel for its mission. Utilization of evidence-based training methods as well as best practice injury recovery techniques enable the Marine Corps to establish effective PT regimes, mitigate injuries, and assess/treat injuries when they occur. The U.S. Marine Corps Training and Education Command (TECOM) has employed civilian ATs as part of the SMIP Program since 2003 to reduce injuries and lost workdays associated with musculoskeletal injuries. The program has had the intended effect within ELT venues and the Marine Corps is exploring the possible expansion to the OPFOR. The contractor shall provide ATs to support worldwide AT services within Marine OPFOR Formations and ELT locations. The objective of this requirement is to provide OPFOR units and select ELT schools with SMIP Program ATs. This will be accomplished by providing state-of-the-art, professional services in human performance. Human performance includes integrated, evidence based strength and conditioning programs that aim to prevent injuries from happening as well as rehabilitation programs that accelerate the return to duty of those recovering from performance related injuries. AT's will be part of a comprehensive human performance team including unit training cadre such as Marine Force Fitness Instructors as well as sports medicine fellowship trained physicians. <br />Objectives: There are three (3) objectives of SMIP Program ATs. <br />(1) Injury Prevention and Physical Training Program Design - This task is for assistance in designing evidence based physical training plans that optimize performance and mitigate injuries. In support of this task, AT's will provide injury prevention and physical training subject matter expertise to Force Fitness Instructors assigned to units.<br />(2) Injury Evaluation and Treatment - This task is for the evaluation and treatment of musculoskeletal injuries as a certified AT under the supervision of a Physician Supervisor. Supervision will be direct for the first 30 days, then indirect thereafter. When working with injured Marines, AT's will complement existing sports medicine assets.<br />(3) Documentation and Administration - This task is for the appropriate reporting of activities/injuries and inventory and maintenance of supplies and materials. <br />Qualifications: ATs must possess a Secret Security Clearance at the service locations/units. Security requirements are in accordance with the DD Form 254. Any personnel providing services in Japan shall meet the Status of Forces Agreement criteria. ATs shall possess a bachelors degree (masters degree preferred) in Athletic Training or like degree and be National Athletic Trainers Association Board Of Certification (NATABOC) certified. It is preferred that ATs have at least five years of demonstrated experience with at least 12 months within the preceding 36 months as an AT working with collegiate athletes, professional/Olympic athletes, or military personnel. ATs shall have demonstrated strength and conditioning experience. ATs shall be capable of meeting physical demands of training with Marines including the ability to hike over rough terrain and function in austere environments to observe Marine training evolutions. They must also have the ability to assist with strength and conditioning testing and training protocols, and lift and manipulate loads or weights up to 20 kilograms. <br />The estimated period of performance is 30 September 2018 through 29 September 2022.<br />This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management, market research, and price information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Offerors shall provide examples of estimated hourly prices and hourly labor rates for ATs at the following locations: Camp Pendleton, CA; Camp Lejeune, NC; Kanoehe Bay, HI, Okinawa and Iwakuni Japan, Miramar, CA; Twentynine Palms, CA; Yuma, AZ; Cherry Point, NC, Beaufort, SC, Ft. Leonard Wood and Pensacola, FL. Capability statements shall not exceed 2 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government.
<p>A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be used to determine the availability of acceptable sources and degree of competition for a potential future solicitation. Capability statements are due by 10:00 AM local time on Thursday, 8 March 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: justin.d.robertson12.civ@mail.mil</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC), is hereby issuing this RFI to invite Industry comments related to the draft requirements provided in this RFI. Industry comments should be documented utilizing the instructions found below in the "Specific Comments Sought" section.
<p>Information in this RFI regarding potential requirements is being provided as notional information to interested parties to invite their comments or suggestions. The Government's goal is to receive comments early enough to thoroughly consider those ideas when developing its final procurement strategy. The Government intends to consider all timely responses to this RFI before finalizing its procurement strategy. Your responses to this RFI will not be posted, and questions submitted in response to this RFI will not be answered.</p>
<p>An RFI is not a solicitation and no proposals are being solicited at this time. Do not submit any proprietary data in response to the RFI. Information with proprietary markings will not be read or considered. An RFI does not obligate the Government to issue a request for proposal in the future. Any future solicitation based on the requirements described in this RFI will be published in FedBizOps.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>NASA anticipates issuing a future solicitation for industry to provide 1) a commercial grade coating (including stripping and recoating) for a 1.3m primary mirror for an optical telescope, and if needed (2) a grinding/polishing service.</p>
<p>The NASA MCAT telescope is a 1.3m optical telescope located in a highly corrosive environment on Ascension Island, South Atlantic Ocean. The M1 (primary) mirror, which has an F-ratio of F2.331, currently has a corroded protected aluminum coating that must be stripped and recoated. It is possible that the mirror may require polishing if the corroded coating has etched the Zerodur&reg; substrate.</p>
<p>This RFI provides the following draft documents to support information requested in the following section:</p>
<p>&bull; SOW_NASA.MCAT.mirror: Draft Statement of Work: Meter Class Autonomous Telescope 1.3-m Mirror Recoating, Polishing, Grinding Services</p>
<p>&bull; RFI&nbsp;requested comments</p>
<p>SPECIFIC COMMENTS SOUGHT</p>
<p>NASA is interested in Industry's capability to meet either (or both) the (1) Coating requirements, and/or (2) Polishing requirements. Please provide comments with rationale and benefits to any proposed inputs.<br /><br />For (1) Coating Requirements: the Government specifically requests comments relative to the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Requirements: For each of the requirements listed in the SOW document provided, please detail if your company can provide all of the requirements, or if not, what could be met for each of the unmet requirement(s)?</p>
<p>a. For example, SOW item 1.3.1, 1b: if the tooling to hold the mirror requires an area greater than 5mm from the edge of the clear aperture to hold the mirror to be either stable or reduce cost of fabricating the tooling, please indicate what is recommended.<br /><br />b. Where appropriate, if the desired requirements will increase the cost of the proposed work, and if, given the provider's experience, relaxing the requirement would have a limited effect in the performance of the telescope: please indicate (1) what requirements could be met and (2) the potential cost/schedule savings of the recommended requirement.</p>
<p>2. Coating Description: Please provide a description of :</p>
<p>a. the proposed reflective coating (e.g., material composition such as enhanced/protected Al, dielectric, etc.)<br /><br />b. the proposed protective coating (e.g., SiO2 overcoat, etc.)<br /><br />c. how that coating can be removed in the future (e.g. chemical stripping, grinding/polishing, etc.)</p>
<p>3. Reflectivity: For the 360nm - 1&micro;m spectral bandpass:</p>
<p>a. Please provide an expected reflectivity curve (plot) for the above bandpass<br /><br />b. Please also provide the value of the average reflectivity across each of the 4 Sloan Digital Sky Survey g&#697;, r&#697;, i&#697;, z&#697; bandpasses per the RFI attachment, "Bandpasses Chart."</p>
<p>4. Testing: Please provide a description of tests that have been done by your company on the proposed coatings in the past and whether the coatings have passed these tests, specifically addressing:</p>
<p>a. Adhesion, adherence, durability, corrosion, inspection tests - see SOW for Mil-Spec requirements and tests.<br /><br />b. If the Mil-Spec tests listed in the draft SOW have not been used as tests on the proposed coating in the past, but a similar test has been done, please describe it and the results. In particular:<br /><br />i. Tests or standards relevant for specifications of this service in a sulfur-rich, volcanic dust environment (See, e.g., SOW 1.3.1, 3.b)</p>
<p>5. Cost/Schedule/Technical Impacts: Please indicate what the cost/schedule impacts are, and recommendations for balancing cost/schedule/technical advantages where appropriate, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Identify whether any of the items in the draft statement of work are not standard industry practices.<br /><br />b. Identify items that may require custom development.<br /><br />c. Items in the draft statement of work that may be unnecessary, line items that need to be added, or line items that are cost drivers leading to a higher price or schedule impacts that are longer in duration than is typical for this service, where not already addressed above.</p>
<p>6. ROM (Rough order of magnitude) Cost: Is commercial pricing available to support the above or to support the effort as detailed in the draft SOW? If so, please provide ROM cost for each coating option that includes a breakdown of the following:</p>
<p>a. Analysis of the current degraded coating (e.g., potential causes of degradation)<br /><br />b. Analysis of a rough estimate of the percentage of the surface area of the mirror is affected by etching (IF it is etched at all).<br /><br />c. Tooling to support the 800+lb 1.3m diameter primary mirror (18 inch interior hole)<br /><br />d. Stripping the current degraded coating<br /><br />e. Recoating the mirror with a durable coating that can be chemically removed without damaging the underlying Zerodur&reg; polished glass<br /><br />f. 8 witness samples to be placed in the chamber when the mirror is coated<br /><br />g. Any other applicable costs for the work to be completed</p>
<p>7. Schedule: Please provide an anticipated schedule to complete the work, and any conflicts with completing the work within the April - Oct 2018 timeframe.</p>
<p>8. Performance and experience: Please provide your past performance and experience, including details related to key projects and professional-grade telescopes that the vendor has conducted in past performance for meter-class mirrors.</p>
<p><br />For (2) Polishing Requirements and a description of the optical parameters of the mirror, see the SOW. Please provide the following:</p>
<p>1. Requirements:</p>
<p>a. For each of the requirements listed, please detail if your company can provide all of the requirements or if not, what could be met for those requirement(s)?<br /><br />b. Please provide a description of how you would document that the RMS WFE requirement is met, including:</p>
<p>i. How the final surface finish will be analyzed (e.g., null lens, computer generated hologram, etc.), and <br />ii. What analysis parameters will be provided as proof (e.g., RMS WFE, RMS Peak-to-Valley, etc.).</p>
<p>2. Cost/Schedule/Technical Impacts: Please indicate what the cost/schedule impacts are, and recommendations for balancing cost/schedule/technical advantages where appropriate, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Identify whether any of the items in the draft statement of work are not standard industry practices.<br /><br />b. Identify items that may require custom development.<br /><br />c. Items in the draft statement of work that may be unnecessary, line items that need to be added, or line items that are cost drivers leading to a higher price or schedule impacts that are longer in duration than is typical for this service, where not already addressed above.</p>
<p>3. ROM (Rough order of magnitude) Cost: Is commercial pricing available to support the above or a rough order of magnitude (ROM) to support the effort? If so, please provide a ROM cost, detailing</p>
<p>a. Expected cost and schedule if minimal etching is present (polishing only required, no improvement of the WFE of the delivered mirror).<br /><br />b. Expected cost/schedule if more significant etching is discovered (fine grinding and polishing required, no improvement of the WFE of the originally delivered mirror_<br /><br />c. Expected cost/schedule to also improve the WFE of the originally delivered mirror (requirement: 42nm WFE).</p>
<p>4. Schedule: Please provide an anticipated schedule to complete the work, and any conflicts with completing the work within the April - Oct 2018 timeframe.</p>
<p>5. Performance and experience: Please provide your past performance and experience, including details related to similar projects and professional-grade telescopes that the vendor has conducted similar services for in past performance</p>

OBJECTIVE</strong> - The Naval Research Laboratory is searching for potential sources capable of fulfilling a requirement for an Acoustic Wave Transfer liquid handling system.<br /><br />There are several research projects that require the rapid and highly accurate dispensing of very low volumes of liquids to different destination formats. An acoustic wave transfer system capable of dispensing nanoliters volumes to multiple different destination formats with a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility is required.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a Request for Proposals will be issued early in 2017. Answers to this RFI will be key in shaping certain aspects of the requirement.</p>
<p><br /><strong>C. CONTRACT TYPE</strong>: The Government is contemplating a solicitation of proposals for award of a firm-fixed priced contract</p>
<p><br /><strong>D. COMPETITION STRATEGY</strong> - Currently contemplating full and open competition unless the results from this RFI support a set-aside of any kind. Federal multiple award schedule holders and/or small businesses are encouraged to reply.</p>
<p><br /><strong>E. LENGTH OF AWARD</strong> - From date of award through delivery</p>
<p><br /><strong>F. MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS</strong> - The draft minimum technical requirements for the effort are outlined below. The Government is currently in the planning stages for this procurement and may continue to modify the language within the requirement as necessary. The information below does not necessarily represent the final specifications.<br /><br />To meet the NRL's research needs, an acoustic wave transfer system must meet the following requirements:<br /><br />1. Must be able to dispense volumes of 25nL - 10 uL from one well on source plate to any well/position on a destination plate.<br /><br />2. The above capability must include from one well to one well, one well to multiple wells, and from multiple wells to single or multiple wells in combinations that can be program through both instrument software or using other software such as Microsoft Excel. <br /><br />3. Must have transfer precision less than or equal to 8% CV.<br /><br />4. The instrument must utilize tip-less transfer technology.<br /><br />5. The instrument must accommodate a variety of destination plate formats including traditional microtiter plates (96-, 384-, 1536- well), polymer sheets, and glass slides and MALDI chips<br /><br />6. Must be able to accommodate a range of solutions that may vary in salinity viscosity, and other chemical properties. At the minimum the instrument must be able to transfer a 50% glycerol solution and solutions that contain DMSO at a concentration of 30% or less. <br /><br />7. This instrument must be able to accommodate a number of different sample solutions within a single experiment. Since these will often vary in salinity, molar concentration, and other chemical properties; the system must have the ability to analyze individual solutions during the experiment (transfer process) to ensure efficiency of volume transfer. Ideally, the data generated from fluid analysis would allow the unit to compensate through changes in transducer strength and positioning to ensure accurate reagent transfer.</p>
<p><br /><strong>G. RESPONSE FORMAT</strong> - The Government asks that interested parties, at a minimum, supply the following information in a Capability Statement using the following format:</p>
<p><br /><strong>REQUIRED INFORMATION - </strong>The below information MUST be included, in its entirety,&nbsp;in the format below.</p>

<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>The Norfolk District, Corps of Engineers is conducting Market Research to identify potential Sources for the Renovate 60C Low Roof Area project at DLA / DSCR, Chesterfield County, Richmond, Virginia. The project will provide renovations to the low-roof building addition to Warehouse 60, called "60C." It was built in 1953, and is a concrete masonry addition that was used as administrative space, and has been unoccupied for several years. This addition abuts Warehouse 60 and is approximately 6,400 square feet in size. Building 60C has direct access into Warehouse 60 and has entrances onto the loading platforms on both sides. The project renovations include private offices, customer service area, open cubicle workstations, conference space, training space, breakroom, and bathroom work. The building systems such as plumbing, electrical, and fire protection are aging, substandard for current uses, and not in compliance with current building, life safety, and accessibility codes. The building's envelope consists of single wythe painted CMU and single pane windows resulting in poor energy efficiency in accordance with today's standards. The area shows evidence of moisture intrusion which has caused damage to interior finishes and other building components. The interior gypsum walls, carpet and other porous materials exhibit black mold growth. Removal of these materials, as well as mold remediation of semi-porous materials such as wood and CMU and non-porous materials that remain is required. Asbestos and lead paint are also present on the interior of the building and must also be abated prior to construction. The area must be made handicapped-accessible in accordance with the current standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), and must be made compliant with all current ATFP standards, including UFC 4-010-1. The project includes normal sustainability requirements, and also includes a Furniture Package that must be provided. The anticipated period of performance is 240 calendar days.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought anticipates the need for a laydown area for the project. The project is located on the west side of the larger Warehouse 60 on the DLA / DSCR facility and such areas should be available for work during regular working hours (7:00am to 4:30pm). No holiday work is anticipated.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer has classified this requirement as Commercial and Institutional Building Construction - North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 236220. The small business size standard is $36.5 million. <br />The order of magnitude for this effort is estimated between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. Contractors will be required to submit bonding documents prior to award. Bonding documents are not required for this source sought.</p>

AURORA SCIENTIFIC, INC. Dual-Mode Ex-vivo Muscle Physiology System
STATEMENT OF WORK

The GMR Service needs to purchase an ex-vivo small animal muscle physiology systems to measure muscle contraction as part of a new research project supported by a Merit Review Award from the Rehabilitation Research and Development Service to Dr. Christopher Cardozo (Grant B-2313-R). 

The equipment requested is an Aurora Scientific, Inc. System 1200A ex-vivo muscle physiology system which is vital to conducting the research in the above-named grant proposal. This instrument is not presently available at James J Peters VA and, as such, must be purchased in order to proceed with the funded research project. The instrument would be used for other projects for which funding is pending once procurement has been completed. The instrument is from Aurora Scientific, Inc., and to the best of our knowledge no similar instrument is available from other manufacturers. As such a limited sole source is requested. 

James J Peters VA wishes to purchase two systems for measuring muscle function after being removed from rats or mice. This is called ex-vivo muscle physiology and the system includes a chamber filled with fluid to keep the muscle moist and provide nutrients, electrical stimulators that deliver electrical impulses that cause muscle to contract, and a force gauge connected to a computer system to measure how strongly muscle contracts.

There are very few manufacturers providing this category of instrumentation and only one that sells integrated systems that are easily assembled, designed specifically for the purpose of ex-vivo physiologic testing of muscle from mice and rats, and provides software to easily and automatically perform all necessary calculations from raw data. Aurora Scientific is the standard in the field. VA knows of no other source that provides fully integrated ex-vivo physiology systems for measuring muscle performance for rats and mice. The system includes the following components:

Series 300 Dual-Mode Muscle Levers
Series 400 Force Transducers
Series 600 Data Acquisition Hardware and Software 
Series 700 Stimulators, constant current
Series 800 Apparatus for muscle mechanics testing

Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>

In order for the FBI to proceed with the required studies it is necessary to establish a service agreement to ensure that preventive maintenance, instrument failure, and other necessary items are addressed in a timely and cost-effective manner which in turn will ensure this effort can move forward unhindered.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that ANDE Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the FBI's existing ANDE 6C instrument and is the only vendor that can provide the required service agreement.</p>

All submissions will be evaluated in accordance with the below selection criteria. The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. Any resulting award for the proposed A/E services will be procured under a negotiated Firm-Fixed Price contract.

NOTE: The 500-mile radius will be measured by one or more of the nationally recognized commercial free on-line mapping services from the Primary or established Auxiliary/Satellite Office Address to the above VA address (shortest driving distance option).  Proximity of the firm s assigned office, to the project site, including within the 500-mile radius, is one of the criteria on which selection of the most highly qualified firms will be based. 

Interested parties shall ensure current licensing to provide real property design services ( Architect Services ) in accordance with the State regulations of which the firm s assigned office is located, and shall have a current registration in: (1.) the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov, (2.) and the Vendor Information Pages database at http://www.va.gov/osdbu, if applicable, and (3.) have submitted the current cycle VETS-4212 Report at http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm (for contracts in the amount of $150,000.00 or more).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Comsol Multiphysics of Burlington, MA for the procurement of the renewal of Comsol Multiphysics license and modules used by NIST's Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology.
<p>COMSOL Multiphysics is the sole contractor authorized to provide the licenses and respective modules to the NIST CNST based upon the following:</p>
<p>NIST has multiple external users that utilize Comsol Software, including Caltech, U.Calgary, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the University of Dayton.  NIST collaborates with them through the exchange of simulation model files, working on building simulations together, etc.  If NIST were to switch to another software, the capability to collaborate and interchange information with other users and internally would be impacted significantly, resulting in a serious delay of the operations and mission of the division and projects.  In addition, NIST CNST requires a floating network license as it allows for flexibility to install the software on multiple computers, which access is specifically based on license counts currently in use.</p>
<p>No other vendor is authorized to provide COMSOL licenses, in addition, no other software license is fully compatible with the current Comsol licenses, modules, and software in use.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511210, with a size standard of $38.5M.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by date and time as established in this notice, shall be considered by the Government.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">U.S. naval nuclear propulsion plants use a pressurized-water reactor design that has two basic systems:&nbsp; the primary system and the secondary system.&nbsp; The primary system circulates ordinary water in an all-welded, closed loop consisting of the reactor vessel, piping, pumps, and steam generators.&nbsp; The heat produced in the reactor core is transferred to the water, which is kept under pressure to prevent boiling.&nbsp; The heated water passes through the steam generators where it gives up its energy.&nbsp; The primary water is then pumped back to the reactor to be heated again.<br /><br />Inside the steam generators, the heat from the primary system is transferred across a watertight boundary to the water in the secondary system, also a closed loop.&nbsp; The secondary water (which is at relatively low pressure) boils, creating steam.&nbsp; Isolation of the secondary system from the primary system prevents water in the two systems from intermixing, keeping radioactivity out of the secondary water.<br /><br />In the secondary system, steam flows from the steam generators to drive the main propulsion turbines (which turn the ship's propellers) and the turbine generators (which supply the ship with electricity).&nbsp; After passing through the turbines, the steam condenses back into water, and feed pumps return it to the steam generators for reuse.&nbsp; Thus, the primary and secondary systems are separate, closed systems in which continuously circulating water transforms the heat produced by the nuclear reaction into useful work (such as propulsion or electricity).<br />No step in this process requires the presence of air or oxygen.&nbsp; This, combined with the ship's ability to produce oxygen and purified water from seawater, allows a submarine to operate completely independent of the Earth's atmosphere for extended periods of time.&nbsp; In fact, the length of a submerged submarine patrol is limited primarily by the amount of food the ship can carry for the crew.</span></p>

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent to sole source to Dataminr a small business for access to their social media monitoring platform.<br />The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is a leader in preparing the nation and its communities to respond to and recover from public health and medical disasters and emergencies. ASPR's Office of Emergency Management (OEM) is directly involved in the execution of many of ASPR's NHSS program areas. In particular, OEM is integral to ASPR's ability to provide rapid public health and medical support to Federal, State, local and Tribal governments who may be responding to incidents of national significance or public health and medical emergencies. The Office of Emergency Management is responsible for developing operational plans, analytical products, and training and readiness exercises to ensure the preparedness of the OEM, HHS, the Federal Government and the public to respond to domestic and international public health and medical threats and emergencies. OEM's Divisions and the programs under it come together to support HHS' lead role in Emergency Support Function (ESF) 8 of the National Response Framework (NRF), and for the Health and Social Services Recovery Support Function (RSF) of the National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF). When a disaster overwhelms a community, the ASPR Office of Emergency Management (ASPR/OEM) provides medical care and delivers medical supplies to assist state and local communities in treating people affected by the event. ASPR/OEM helps local communities' health care systems by enhancing their ability to maintain health care operations, even in the face of an emergency. They accomplish this by providing resources to communities which enable them to facilitate disaster planning efforts and ensure the health care system can properly respond to threats to their infrastructure. The ASPR/OEM provides resources and expertise to prepare communities for public health and medical emergencies through engaging health care system partners and volunteers from local communities. ASPR/OEM also coordinates health and social service recovery efforts for communities which have been affected by a disaster. ASPR/ OEM continuously supports direct and open communication with all federal, state, local, tribal, territorial and non-governmental organization stakeholders. ASPR/OEM provides decision-makers with in-depth information and analysis of trends to better respond to a public health or medical emergency. ASPR/OEM accomplishes this by providing tools for the United States Government (USG), state and local health departments and other entities to track public health and medical emergencies in a specified community.</p>
<p>ASPR/OEM's ability to mount a rapid public health and medical response to emergencies requires robust monitoring and detection capability. ASPR/OEM Operation's personnel staff the HHS Secretary's Operations Center and provides 24/7 monitoring and detection for situations that may warrant a federal response. This capability is achieved through a variety of mechanisms including sustained federal interagency information sharing, specific threat warning systems such as the USGS earthquake notification service, as well as various HHS Operating Division public health surveillance systems used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is to establish ASPR/OEM access to software platform for use by Operations personnel in the HHS Secretary's Operations Center.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THUNDERSTORM TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION and EXPERIMENTATION 18-2: <br />Dense Urban and Subterranean Challenges</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DISTRIBUTION A. Approved for public release: distribution unlimited </strong></p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS: Technology Demonstration and Experimentation Collaboration</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.	INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to solicit technologies from private industry, government research and development (R&amp;D) organizations, and academia for inclusion in future capability demonstration and experimentation events focused on emerging challenges presented by dense urban and subterranean environments. This effort is sponsored by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping, Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO). The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the warfighter by demonstrating and experimenting with the capability in an operationally relevant environment. The results of this effort will be used to inform decision makers of emerging and available technology solutions that enhance or improve operational capabilities.</p>
<p>Interested parties are welcome to submit their applications to participate in the demonstration and experimentation events. Technologies demonstrations are planned to take place at the unclassified level; as such, proposals must be submitted at the unclassified level. For technologies that have features or applications at higher classification levels, please respond with an unclassified proposal. If this technology is chosen for the Thunderstorm 18-2 demonstration, arrangements can then be made for subsequent discussions at the appropriate level. This RFI is for Thunderstorm 18-2, with demonstrations and experiments planned for July-August 2018 in the New York City area, or another metropolitan area within the eastern United States. Thunderstorm 18-2 will be a continuation of previous similar events to support diverse operations within megacities and subterranean environments.</p>
<p><strong>The application deadline is 5:00 PM EDT on 04 April 2018.</strong></p>
<p>This RFI is NOT a solicitation for procurement or other acquisition proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p><strong>B.	BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>Thunderstorm provides an opportunity for technology developers to demonstrate and experiment with new and evolving technological capabilities in an operationally relevant environment, as well as to obtain insight into federal technology gaps and emerging needs. The demonstration and experimentation environment enables a collaborative working relationship between government organizations, academia, and industry. This promotes the identification of emerging needs and an assessment of maturing technologies with the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the Department of Defense and interagency partners. Thunderstorm provides a realistic demonstration environment for technology developers to interact with operational personnel. Technologies brought to the event should be at a technology readiness level (TRL) of 4 or greater ( http://www.acqnotes.com/acqnote/tasks/technolo gy- r eadin ess -level).</p>
<p>The Thunderstorm technology demonstration and experimentation event(s) involves individual or multiple technologies and is conducted with interagency partners. The technology developer provides the capability for demonstration and experimentation and personnel for installation and integration into the overall event. The technology developer operates the system during the event and uninstalls the system upon completion. The Thunderstorm staff plans, coordinates, and assists with the associated logistics of the technology demonstration and experimentation, and provides limited assistance for the installation and integration efforts. The Thunderstorm staff will not assist with engineering changes to the demonstrated technology or system.</p>
<p>Industry, academia, and other government organizations are invited to submit demonstration and experimentation applications addressing innovative technologies, potentially leading to follow-on government/industry collaboration and further development of emerging capabilities or fielding of mature capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>C.	DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Thunderstorm 18-2 demonstration and experimentation event will focus on challenges encountered during humanitarian, first responder, and military operations within megacity and subterranean environments. The event will primarily focus on developmental and mature technologies (TRL 4-9) and is planned to be conducted over a two-week timeframe in July-August 2018 in or near New York City, NY. Participation may not necessarily require the demonstrator to be present the entire period. Under the direction of RRTO, the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) will lead the 18-2 demonstration and experimentation event, and the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU) and the Department of Homeland Security, National Urban Security Technology Laboratory (DHS/NUSTL) will provide support as required, along with other DoD and civil service partners.</p>
<p>The top-level objective of the demonstrated technologies is to provide support for humanitarian, first responder, or military unit operations within a dense urban and subterranean environment. Many of the technology needs listed below are relevant to warfighters and responders alike.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) [ ___<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>] Are, [ ___<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) [ ___<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>] Have, [ ___<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(3) [ ___<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>] Are, [ ___<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(4) [ ___<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>] Have, [ ___<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

<DESC><span>
<p>The period of performance shall consist of a basic one-year period after contract award plus four one year</p>
<p>ordering periods. The contract type is a Firm-Fixed Price Requirements type for all ordering periods. The items to be repaired are the following: NSN: 6615123867894HL; PN: 145130-7000; Noun: Gyroscope Control used on the TH-1H helicopter; NSN: 6615123726798HL; PN: 141852-3122; Noun: Gyroscope Control used on the TH-1H helicopter. The best estimated quantities for the basic year are 8 each for both NSNs and 4 each for both NSNs for the remaining 4 out years. The TH-1H mission is the primary flight instruction platform for all USAF helicopter pilots. The AHRS combines the functions of a vertical gyro, a gyro stabilized magnetic compass, and three rate gyros within one single unit. The AHRS is used on the TH-1H aircraft. The TH-1H is the primary platform for training all USAF helicopter pilots. AHRS is an all attitude inertial sensor system which provide aircraft attitude, heading and flight dynamics (body rates and accelerations) information, which are typically used for flight control and pilot displays. The system is mechanized as a strap-down inertial measurement system using fiber optic rate sensors and micro-mechanic accelerometers which are 'strapped down' to the principle aircraft axes. A digital computer mathematically integrates the rate and acceleration data to obtain heading, pitch and roll attitude.</p>
<p>Augmented by air data the systems also provide filtered inertial altitude and vertical velocity.</p>
<p>The system shall operate from either a primary or auxiliary 28VDC power input. Both power inputs are intended to be supplied by different electrical busses. To prevent a reverse feeding of the bus that is currently not supplying the system, both inputs shall be de-coupled (e.g. by diodes). The system shall switch on when the voltage exceeds 18VDC. The system shall operate with an input voltage down to 15VDC. The specifications required for this asset are as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">NSN: 6615123726798HL, Height: 5.0", Length: 7.0", Width: 4.0", Weight: 2.0lbs. MATL: metal case, electronics.<br /><br />NSN: 6615123867894HL, Height: 4.0", Length: 7.0", Width: 5.0", Weight: 2.0lbs. MATL: metal case, electronics. Delivery: 90 days ARO funded order or reparable assets, whichever is later. Early delivery is acceptable.</p>
<p>Destination: Robins AFB, GA, 31098-1887</p>
<p>&nbsp;The solicitation will be available for viewing or downloading at <br /><a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>www.fedbizopps.gov</span></span></a><span> only.

<p>II. Evaluation Criteria - The specific evaluation criteria to be used are as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3), comparative evaluation procedures will be utilized.

The below evaluation factors will be utilized during evaluation (in no order of relative importance):</p>
<p>1. Technical Acceptability:</p>

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System.

(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [XX] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [XX], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [XX] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [XX], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [XX], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Term is mandatory for lodging and hotel requirements. This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. For a proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor. All proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel shall provide the following: (1) Valid General Liability Insurance Certificate. (2) Hotel agreement verified, and countersigned by both parties and the authorized agent of the participating hotel (hotel letterhead). (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable).<BR><BR>The hotel must enjoy at least a four (4) star rating or four (4) diamonds rating as established by AAA.<BR><BR>
