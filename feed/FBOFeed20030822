<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, for purchasing Professional services over a 12-month period to support the ongoing research in image processing for biomedical informatics research and development.  The investigator will support the research work in developing and implementing algorithms that satisfies the needs for the ongoing research at the National Library of Medicine in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of digitized spine x-ray images.  

The investigator shall 1.Research, develop, and implement Partial Shape Matching algorithms for vertebra shapes segmented from the NHANES II digitized spine x-ray images. For this the investigator will segment the vertebra shapes as necessary using software provided by the Government; 2.Determine appropriate shape features for PSM. Use of these features should reflect improved query-relevance in vertebra image retrieval in comparison to whole shape matching methods. Shape features and point-to-point distance have been used in PSM algorithms in the literature. These features may be used as an initial step in the research. It is necessary for the selected features to exhibit properties of invariance to translation, rotation and scale. The performance of the developed methods will be evaluated by the investigator in accordance with communications with the researchers at the NLM; 3.Research into shape-based querying and matching methods for retrieval of pair of vertebrae that exhibit intervertebral disc-space narrowing (DSN). Though this work is not considered as the major thrust of this contract, it is expected that the investigator shall explore and develop basic techniques to address the problem and provide experimental results; 4.Develop a prototype system or enhance a prototype provided by the Government to demonstrate the above techniques; 5.Provide a report detailing the research work and include all source code for the developed algorithms and the prototype software, data including segmented shapes, and experimental results in accordance with the requirements of the Government; 6. Seek, if required, expert medical guidance/opinion on any or all of the tasks above, at no additional cost to the Government.	Government rights to work first produced under this contract are established by Federal law including, but not limited to, this specific reference:  FAR 42.227-14, Rights in Data – General, (b) (1). 

Offerors are required to notify the Government in writing of any dependencies of the deliverables under this contract on proprietary, copyrighted, or patented work that potentially inhibits, restricts, or requires permission for the dissemination of the deliverables to the public, other governmental agencies or research groups, or to any other parties whatsoever.  

Brigham Young University (BYU) is uniquely qualified for this task as Dr.D.J. Lee provides his research team at BYU with 13 years of experience in developing and implementing computer vision and image analysis algorithms and software for various applications. From previous research projects, he has demonstrated excellent track records in delivering research results on time and within budget.  His research capability is clearly exhibited in his publications, especially in the content-based image retrieval (CBIR) research area. In addition, his experience with the NHANES II digitized spine x-ray image collection and development of whole shape retrieval algorithms for them further qualifies him as the ideal candidate for this task.  He has designed over 40 real-time machine vision systems and products for various industries. His current research focus at BYU is in content-based medical image retrieval, shape-based pattern recognition, medical image analysis, 3D reconstruction, motion analysis, and object tracking. Dr. Lee spent the summer of 2002 working with the researchers in the Communications Engineering Branch at National Library of Medicine on the content-based spine x-ray image retrieval project. He successfully evaluated and implemented several shape representation and matching methods and obtained and delivered valuable results. In collaboration with the researchers at NLM, he has since submitted and/or published six technical papers as author or co-author on content-based image retrieval of spine x-ray images. Dr. Lee is uniquely qualified for this research work because of his understanding of the project, extensive experience in content-based image retrieval, and thorough understanding of the characteristics of the image data. 

This service will be procured under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.

<SUBJECT>B--Protocol to Deflect Migrating Bowhead Whales Away from an Oil Spill
<SOLNBR>74086
<RESPDATE>090303
<ARCHDATE>08212004
<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contract Specialist 7037871367     Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract to conduct a study entitled Protocol to Deflect Migrating Bowhead Whales Away from an Oil Spill. This study will provide a comprehensive review, analysis, and recommendation for optimal methods and related logistics. The protocol shall be based on scientific and other knowledge of the responses of bowhead and other cetaceans to various disturbances and barriers.  It shall recommend a step-down protocol for keeping bowhead whales away from a proscribed area over a period of days and provide recommendations for enhancing methods of deflecting bowhead whales.  THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES A PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FOR THIS CONTRACT OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS AND A COST RANGE BETWEEN $230,000 AND $237,000.  BACKGROUND: To provide information used in environmental impact statements and environmental assessments under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, and to assure protection of marine mammals under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 USC 1361-1407) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 (16 USC 1531-1543), MMS Environmental Studies Program funds numerous studies involving acquisition and analysis of marine mammal and other environmental data.  Fall hunting of bowhead whales is considered an important part of Inupiat culture and is a vital subsistence harvest for the villages of Barrow, Nuiqsut, and Kaktovik, Alaska.  Keeping whales away from any large oil spills would have important management implications relative to this subsistence harvest.  While implementing the protocol might increase potential disruption of the whale harvest in a given year, it would reduce the likelihood and scope of potential oil-spill effects relative to perceived contamination of whale tissues.  A protocol for keeping bowheads away would likely become a key part of any first-line response in the unlikely event of a large oil spill in the Beaufort Sea. The protocol would help reduce the potential for any oil-spill-related mortality or sub-lethal effects to this endangered species.  In a 2001 Arctic Region Biological Opinion, National Marine Fisheries Service provided a Conservation Recommendation that MMS study "the possible use of air guns as a deterrent for bowhead whales near an oil spill."  Not limited to a particular sound source, this study will develop a protocol for deflection by providing a comprehensive review, analysis, and recommendations for optimal methods and related logistics.  Current leasing schedules indicate that further judicious leasing for oil and gas development is planned for the Beaufort Sea.  With additional information on the deflecting bowhead whales from the general area of a hypothetical oil spill, alternative mitigation options for future Beaufort sales may be feasible.  Information from this endangered-whale study will be used in the preparation of draft and final EA's for Beaufort Sea Lease Sales 195 and 202.  The information will be important to analysis and documents related to the ESA Section 7 consultation for future offshore oil and gas development plans.  Study information will be used in writing post-lease EIS's and EA's and in reviewing oil-industry plans for exploration, development, and transportation in the Beaufort Sea.  The Final Report will be needed in 2004. SCOPE OF WORK: The overall goal of the study is to develop guidelines for keeping bowhead whales away from any large oil spills.  Specific objectives for meeting this goal include: (1) analyze the literature on potential methods (e.g., noise) for excluding or deflecting cetaceans from proscribed areas; (2) develop a coordinated field protocol that uses the best available methods for keeping bowhead whales away from a hypothetical oil spill over a period of days and/or weeks; and, (3) provide recommendations for enhancing methodologies of deflecting migrating bowhead whales from potential oil spills.  LITERATURE ANALYSIS: The Contractor shall analyze the scientific literature as well as published narrative descriptions of commercial and subsistence whale hunters on the various types of disturbances known to deflect whales.  The Contractor shall evaluate the potential for use of acoustic disturbance including but not limited to: air guns, whale boats, and/or prerecorded noises of air guns, orca vocalizations, and icebreaker cavitations.  Non-acoustic methods to be analyzed and rated include (but not limited to) visual disturbance (e.g., low-flying aircraft) and physical barriers (e.g., oil booms, stationary nets) on whales.  The analysis shall fully describe the level of success that any existing methods or protocols may have already had in excluding or deflecting marine mammals from proscribed areas.  The Contractor shall also summarize any permit requirements, schedule considerations, and/or adjustments to existing Incidental Harassment Authorizations needed in order to deflect whales from the vicinity of any oil spills.  PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT: The protocol shall have a rapid-deployment capability in the unlikely event of a large oil spill.  The primary purpose of the protocol is to exclude or deflect migrating bowhead (and other) whales away from the perimeter of a large oil spill in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, with applications to other cetacean species.  The cost of implementing the protocol shall be considered and described, but should not limit important workable options.  The protocol shall be usable for helping to deflect the highest number of whales within the first few days of a spill, when inhalation of volatile components might be expected to have the greatest adverse effect, as well as deflect a maximal number of whales over a period of weeks.  Techniques recommended should be capable of keeping whales from the vicinity of an oil spill but minimize scattering whales.  It shall define how the selected protocol would likely relate to an actual oil-spill clean-up in the Beaufort Sea under several ambient conditions.  The protocol shall discuss variables that might limit the effectiveness of certain options including ambient ice type, ice concentration, competing disturbances from oil-spill cleanup activities, and a certain amount of uncontrolled vessel and air traffic.  In developing the draft field protocol, the contractor shall coordinate fully with existing North Slope oil spill managers such as Alaska Clean Seas so that application of the final report recommendations can be maximized by that group or related government entities.  REVIEW OF DRAFT PROTOCOL: The contractor shall propose and complete an external, broad review of a draft protocol to assure appropriate commentary by Federal and State Agencies, local government, subsistence organizations and other potentially affected and relevant constituents.  The review will be scheduled within the overall project to maximize effectiveness of desired comment.  The contractor shall initiate said review following the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative's concurrence. REPORTING: Report deliverables shall include draft documents and full final report on regular stock paper and a short field protocol printed on waterproof stock.  The field protocol shall contain sufficient illustrations, readable, clear text, and logical step-down sequences for rapid implementation under ambient Beaufort Sea conditions.  The field protocol shall include a list of required off-the-shelf equipment, current commercial sources for such equipment, and a checklist of emergency coordination and permitting.  Per format specifications to be provided, Draft and Final reports will fully describe work completed and results of all activities conducted in accomplishment of study goals and objectives. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT: The Contractor shall adhere to a Program Management Plan (PMP), as proposed and incorporated in the approved Study Plan.  The Contractor shall maximize the potential use of local expertise, vessels, and other extant logistics capabilities when recommending protocol strategies.  As required to accomplish Task 3, the Contractor's PMP shall factor in planning and resources for necessary communication with potential reviewers of the draft protocol.  The Contractor shall also arrange to present the findings of the revised Final Report to key stakeholders.  HOW TO RESPOND: IN ORDER TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT, INTERESTED PARTIES MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO PERFORM THE WORK BY PROVIDING A CAPABILITIES STATEMENT, NOT LATER THAN 04:30PM, 03 SEPTEMBER 2003, DETAILING: (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience; (2) your organizational experience and facilities; and (3) specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number & E-mail address a) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last four years.

<CONTACT>Anne Marie Bastek, Contract Specialist, 781-377-7512 Richard Fox, Contracting Officer, 781-377-6395
<DESC>The following information does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Electronic Systems Center, Global Grid Product Area Directorate (ESC/DIG) at Hanscom Air Force Base, MA is requesting information and feedback from industry for alternative ideas for material solutions and concepts for a robust, beyond line-of-sight (BLOS), command and control (C2) communications capability for sustained control of air operations throughout Afghanistan.  Additionally, companies wishing to provide this capability as a service provider are also invited to respond. The desired outcome of this RFI is to describe solutions and/or concepts, using existing or emerging technologies, which could have an initial capability in place by January 2004, with a longer-term solution to follow if need be.  Information on BLOS C2 Communications will be made available through the Electronic Systems Center Business Opportunities website (HERBB) at http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/. (Note: Select "Systems" within "Business Opportunities" and then scroll to "BLOS C2 Communications"). GENERAL DESCRIPTION: The capability sought will provide non-secure, non-frequency agile VHF (1 frequency plus guard) and UHF (1 frequency plus guard) communications connectivity between aircraft (bombers, fighters, C2 platforms, UAVs) and C2 functions located BLOS of the aircraft.  The C2 functions could be located in Afghanistan or could be at the Al Udeid Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) located 2,000 miles away.  To save on scarce manpower resources, it is highly desired that system components operate unattended and be remotely controlled.  The technical solution should take maximum advantage of commercial off-the-shelf technology, to include commercial satellite systems, if applicable to the design.  Military wideband (25KHz) UHF TACSAT channels are not available; however, narrowband (5 KHz) demand assigned, multiple access (DAMA) channels are available.  System availability rate must not be less than 0.97.  MISSION AND THREAT ANALYSIS:  USCENTAF has a requirement to command and control aircraft in Afghanistan from C2 facilities located BLOS of those aircraft. Air superiority is assumed. Mountainous terrain and extreme distance precludes line-of-sight communications between aircraft and their controllers.  Strong considerations must be given to force protection issues and for ground-based capabilities due to limited control of territory by coalition forces.  There is an inability to provide physical protection of unattended equipment located outside US military compounds in Afghanistan.  NON-MATERIAL ALTERNATIVE:  Changes in concepts of operation, tactics, techniques, procedures and training were initiated as an alternative to the inefficient use of two separate low density/high demand (LD/HD) assets as an airborne radio relay. In the spirit of transformation, an unattended, remotely controllable communications relay system was identified as a viable and cost-effective alternative to relieve LD/HD airborne assets.  CONSTRAINTS: (a) Logistics Support.  Commercial power is not available. Military-provided generator power is not desired because of the subsequent increase in required manpower and support. Neither a commercial nor military telecommunications infrastructure exists.  It is highly desired that maintenance spares and technicians be centrally located to provide as-required on-call support to all unattended radios.  The Government will consider distributed/dedicated spares and personnel located at each site if that is what it takes to obtain a system reliability of 0.97 or better. (b) Transportation.  System components must not exceed the high altitude and load-lifting capabilities of a CH-47.  Additionally, the system components must be capable of being transported by a HMMWV.  (c) Geospatial information and services support. No unique requirements are anticipated.  (d) Manpower.  It is desired that the solution not increase existing manpower requirements; however, the Government will consider options that increase manpower if that is what it takes to obtain a system reliability of 0.97 or better.  This AOR-specific solution will drive a requirement for contract maintenance.  (e) Training. This capability will require operations and maintenance training on all system components and interfaces.  (f) Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence support.  No unique requirements are anticipated. (g) Standardization and Interoperability.  The solution must be simultaneously accessible by not less than 10 C2 elements.  The solution may incorporate any interface to achieve the stated requirements, but must also include provisions for telephonic access.  (h) Timing.  Current LD/HD airborne assets are scheduled to re-deploy in the near future and this capability must be fielded as soon as possible to meet that timeline.  (i) Operational Environment.  It is highly desired that this solution provide a robust, unattended, communications capability to relieve the LD/HD airborne assets from performing radio relay missions in the Afghanistan area of operations.  Note - due to extreme environmental conditions, unattended equipment must be able to operate at altitudes that range from 0,000 MSL to 14,000 MSL in temperature ranges from -40 degrees Fahrenheit to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Written responses to this RFI, not to exceed 10 pages, are due no later than close of business 15 September 2003. Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation may not necessarily result from this RFI.  However, information received in response to the RFI may be reflected in a formal solicitation.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to ESC.  Please note that the HERBB will be the primary source of information for the BLOS C2 Communications acquisition. Interested firms should check for updates frequently and subscribe to the HERBB update service.  Firms are reminded that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. Without written permission from you, ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked with a Proprietary legend.  Any procurement action for this capability will be the subject of a separate, future announcement. Send two paper copies, and 1 electronic copy (i.e., CD or diskette) of your response to the following:  Mr. Richard Fox, Contracting Officer, BLOS C2 Communications, ESC/DIGK, Bldg 1612, 5 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731, richard.fox@hanscom.af.mil, phone: 781-377-6395. Please direct any questions you may have concerning this RFI to Mr. Richard Fox, Contracting Officer (ESC/DIGK) at 781-377-6395 or Ann Bastek, Contract Specialist (ESC/DIGK) at 781-377-7512, ann.bastek@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>This announcement is in accordance with the provisions of FAR 13.5 test program for commercial items.  The U. S. Coast Guard intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with the Maritime Fire and Safety Association (MFSA), Portland, Oregon, a non-profit organization.  The USCG is seeking training and technical support services to enhance the U. S. Coast Guard’s shipboard firefighting and oil spill prevention and response capabilities on the Columbia and Willamette Rivers in Washington and Oregon, pursuant to the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 Public Law 107-295 Sec 407.  Contractor support shall include, but not be limited to, providing specialized training to Coast Guard personnel, assisting the Coast Guard in purchasing shipboard firefighting equipment, and assisting the Coast Guard in maintaining and implementing oil spill response contingency plans for the same region.  The USCG anticipates awarding a five year contract which includes a base year with four one-year option periods.  MFSA was selected for this negotiation because of their presence in the area, their unique expertise with oil spill response contingency planning for the Columbia River, and experience in providing shipboard marine firefighting training.  MFSA is in a unique position to most effectively and efficiently provide this service, in that, it is the only organization in the geographic area that maintains a membership of fire departments on both sides of the Columbia River and has a multiyear record of oil spill and marine fire response on the Columbia River, a Federal navigable waterway.

The following accessories and specifications shall be included in the system:  A) NanoScope IV SPM Control Station with the following: 1) Requires microscope and accessories appropriate for your application.  Microscopes must be NanoScope IV-compatible to support full functionality.  2) Up to 10X faster topographical scanning and PhaseImaging in air with TappingMode+ than provided by conventional SPM controllers.  Standard cantilevers can be used for scanning at conventional rates.  3) Includes Quadrex Extender Electronics with on-board lock-in amplifier for quantitative PhaseImaging, improved accuracy, and enhanced image contrast.  4) Provide OneScan imaging with more data points per scan line (=4000) for the highest resolution available.  Allows zooming on large scans while maintaining nano-scale lateral resolution, without the need for repetitive smaller scans.  5) Q-control for enhanced force control, sensitivity and image contrast, and for studying tip-sample interactions.  6) User-available, low-noise analog feedback loop for some custom applications.  7) High-speed DSP and SPM-computer interface electronics.  8) Six analog-to-digital converters (ADCs, four user-available).  9) Four digital-to-analog converters (DACs) dedicated to Quadrex, and four DACs for other dedicated and user applications.  10) Allows easy access to line sync (end-of-line), frame sync (end-of-frame), and Quadrex lock-in oscillator reference signal.  11) High-speed serial interface for improved hardware/software, including comprehensive image analysis.  12) Windows NT-based SPM imaging software, including comprehensive image analysis.  13) 32-bit dual monitor color display video with effective total resolution 32048x768 pixels.  14) 16-bit resolution on all three scanning axes, regardless of scan size or offset.  15) Extremely flexible for adaptation to user-designed microscopes and/or custom applications.  16) Extensive and expanded real-time control of feedback and other parameters gives the user the freedom to design and execute novel SPM experiments with the advantage of the NanoScope’s precision and reliability.  17) Pentium tower-style PCI computer with twin 18-inch LCD monitors (110V/220V, 50/60 Hz, auto switching).  18) Includes ten micro-actuated probes (Model MMASPCH) if sold with MultiMode microscope.  19) Installation  

B) NanoScope Software & Computer with the following accessories and specifications:  includes a minimum 2.4GHz Pentium 4 PCI, 61GB HD, 512MB RAM, 3.5-inch 1.44MB FD, CD R/W, 100MB Zip Drive, Windows NT operating system, NanoScope SPM Image and Image Analysis Software and network board.

C) NanoScope MultiMode Atomic Force Microscope with the following accessories and specifications:  1) Performs contact and non-contact atomic force, lateral force and TappingMode (air) microscopy.  2) Performs magnetic force and electric force microscopy without additional hardware; however, the Quadrex Extender Electronics (Model Quadrex) or standard Extender Electronics Module (Model PHASE-01) are strongly recommended for the best possible images, including phase/frequency detection and surface potential measurements.  3) Will also perform force modulation (air and fluid), TappingMode (fluid), nanoindenting/scratching, scanning tunneling, electrochemical AFM, and electrochemical STM with additional accessories.  4) Includes new low noise head electronics for lowest possible noise and cleanest possible images when imaging in Q control with a NanoScope IV Control Station.  5) AFM optical head is compatible with on-axis optical viewing of tip placement on the sample, using any of the optional optical microscope systems.  6) XY Sample Stage with 2mm x 2mm range.  7) Accepts samples up to 15mm diameter and 6mm thick.  8) Includes 45X monocular microscope with laser safety filter for viewing the probe and sample.  9) Includes probe handling tools and sample pucks.  10) Includes 20 Silicon Nitride Probes (Model NP-20) and 10 Tapping Mode Etched Silicon Probes (Model RTESP).

D) 10ìm AFM Scanner with Vertical Engage for MMAFM, AFM, and LFM.  This “EV” type scanner provides X-Y range of 10ìm x 10ìm with 2.5ìm vertical range and features a new design for vertical motion which eliminates tilt and lateral movement of the cantilever during engage.  Fully motorized and computer controlled, minimizing manual adjustments.  Includes patented dual piezo material bonded into a single piezo tube scanner with three-point microscope head support.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to acquire 20 each MT-1S reserve parachutes.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency requirement is Para-Flite, Inc., 5800 Magnolia Avenue, Pennsauken, NJ 08109 who owns the patent rights to the item.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. The following specification applies to the MT-1S reserve parachute requirement:  The reserve parachute shall be a 270 square feet, 5-cell ram-air (wing) parachute built using span wise construction with direct suspension line attachment.  The wing span is 21.5 feet, wing chord is 12.75 feet, wing area is 270 square feet, suspended weights are 100-300 pounds, canopy materials is 101 oz ripstop nylon calendered 0-5 cubic feet per minute porosity (F1-11), and the line test strength is 550 pounds.  The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $100,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  This requirement is unrestriced and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 314999 applies. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item #RAQ032320.  However, they must provide supporting evidence they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by September 5, 2003 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Para-Flite, Inc. for the requirements stated here. Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Kay Ryan at 208-387-5717 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

<DESC>The Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has a requirement to solicit additional proposals and expand its research program entitled, “Large Scale Antibody and T Cell Epitope Discovery Program.”  This requirement is to establish and support several highly interactive, multi-disciplinary teams focused on large-scale discovery of novel antibody (B cell) and/or T cell epitopes associated with microorganisms responsible for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, including potential agents of bioterrorism and their toxins (listed as NIAID category A-C agents at www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/bioterrorism/bandc_priority.htm ).  Research conducted under this initiative may include one or more type of epitope discovery, for example:  Discovery of linear and/or conformational antibody epitopes; Discovery of cytotoxic and/or helper T cell epitopes presented by MHC class I and class II molecules, respectively; and Discovery of epitopes/ligands presented by nonclassical MHC and/or MHC-related molecules.  The initiative also promotes the development of novel or improved high-throughput screening methods for antibody and/or T cell epitope identification, with an emphasis on novel methods for the identification of antibody epitopes or T helper cell epitopes.  Through the Large-Scale Antibody and T Cell Epitope Discovery Initiative, the NIAID plans to fund multiple proposals that address one or both of the research areas listed in the Statement of Work.  

This acquisition is an expansion of NIAID RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIT-03-43, Large-Scale Antibody and T Cell Epitope Discovery Program.  The purpose of both acquisitions is identical.  It is anticipated that five to ten (5-10) cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of five years, beginning approximately September 4, 2004.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIT-04-39 will be available electronically on or about August 29, 2003, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

Please note that the RFP for this acquisition only includes the work statement, deliverable and reporting requirements, special requirements, the technical evaluation criteria, and the proposal preparation instructions and provisions.  All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package.  Following proposal submission and the initial review process, offerors comprising the competitive range will be requested to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   NAICS Code: 334516 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the Harvard School of Public Health, 665 Huntington Ave. Boston, MA 02115. The Human Studies Division conducts  research on the health effects of particulate matter (PM). Studies consist of human volunteer subjects inhaling a concentration equivalent to that found in most large U.S. cities. The Personal Cascade Samplers will be to monitor three different size ranges of PM: particles greater than 10 microns  in diameter, particles between 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter, and particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter. These Samplers will also allow the measurement of ozone, as well as elemental/organic carbon and biological components of PM. These measurements are critical for planned epidemiology  studies involving humans with asthma. The samplers will be worn by subjects for a five-day period and pollutant measurements will be taken every day; at the same time, a number of health measurements will be taken.  Mathematical models will then be used to determine if either size range of PM (as  well as other measured pollutants/components) is associated with specific changes in a health indicator. Contractor Requirements: The Contractor shall (1) design, (2) build, and (3) ship four Personal Cascade Samplers that meet the following requirements and characteristics and include the listed  components: (1) Four personal cascade samplers, designed to accommodate three PM cut sizes: 1)particles greater than 10 microns in diameter; 2) particles between 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter; and 3) particles less than microns in diameter. Each sampler must have a flow rate of no more than 5  liters per minute. (2) A flow measuring device to calibrate the samplers to ensure that the correct flow is going through each sampler at the beginning of each day. (3) The cascade samplers must allow the use of polyurethane foam (PUF) instead of Teflon filters to collect particles in the 2.5- 10  micron particle range. NOTE: this is critical because recent methodology has been developed to efficiently extract biological components of PM (which are known to affect asthmatics) from PUF. (4) Stainless steel cutters to cut the PUF to the correct size for the samplers. (5) Four mini-PEM samplers  integrated with each of the cascade samplers to allow the measurement of elemental and organic carbon. These will have an intake of no more than 0.8 liters per minute. (6) Passive samplers integrated with each of the samplers to measure the concentration of ozone in the air. These will have no flow  rate at all. (7) Four rechargeable, battery-operated pumps with flow control that provides at least 5.8 liters per minute of output air. The pump should be small enough to be worn by a person for up to 24 hours, with battery power for at least 24 hours. (8) Four vests or backpacks in which the pump  and samplers can be easily placed and which can be comfortably worn when the subjects are mobile. (9) An operating manual which explains the use and maintenance of the cascade samplers. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Period of performance shall be sixty days from date of award. The EPA has identified  Harvard School of Public Health c/o Petros Koutrakias Ph.D.,the only vendor as the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement. Dr. Petros Koutrakis has extensive experience in designing and constructing samples for both gaseous and particulate pollutants and he has developed personal cascade  samplers which collects particles between 2.5 and 10 microns on PUF. He has also developed a methodology to extract biological components from PUF. The circumstance permitting"other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302-1"Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will  satisfy agency requirements.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source (s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) will be issued. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements and qualifications  may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their  capability and how they would be useful in performing this requirement no later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Jacqueline S. Sayles (MD-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle park, NC 27711. No telephonic or faxed  request will be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   To develop bioindicators for aquatic toxicity applications, the US Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a purchase order under simplified acquisition procedures to Amersham Biosciences.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710 which has a size standard of 500 employees to qualify as a small business.  Amersham Bisociences will develop a database to construct a microarray that would provide an important tool to achieve the Agency's goal of providing a tool to assess risk for water resources.  Amersham has  developed a 3-dimensional coating to synthesize DNA oligos onto microarray slides affording a robust, reproducible, optimal hybridization platform to ensure a dynamic range of detection and results in more useable data per bioarray.  Amersham will provide custom synthesis of a fathead minnow array  and provide quality control validation to guarantee accurate and reliable results.  The following are requirements for this particular requirement:  1.Custom bioarrays need to have a 3-dimensional slide coating comprised of a polymer with amine-reactive groups for covalent attachment of 5'  amino-labeled oligonucleotides.  2. Custom oligonucleotides need to be designed based on provided DNA sequences, and need to be screened in silico and tested under standard expression conditions to ensure optimal and accurate hybridization performance.  3. 100% post dispense inspection needs to be  performed using tracer dyes for the identification and tracking of any manufacturing defects.  4. Bioarrays should be able to detect as low as a single transcript per cell with as little as 2 micrograms of total RNA starting material.  5. The dynamic range needs to be greater than 3 orders of  magnitude which gives more usable data per bioarray.  6. Each bioarray should be set up to ensure uniform hybridization which reduces variability between users.  7. Array set-up and design needs to be compatible with the Affymetrix 528 custom slide analyzer.  The EPA has identified Amersham  Biosciences as the only organization with the qualifications and products to perform the task within the prescribed time frame, i.e., FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements".  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements  may submit qualification statements no later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Please reference RFQ #U4RD35 in any correspondence.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA This combined synopsis/solicitation for Test Prototype Engines for Future Combat Systems(FCS) Manned Ground Vehicles is being ammended for the following reasons: 1) open up the possibility of a rear or sponson mounted engine by removing the reference that the engine will be located in the front of the vehicle 2) change the expected delivery month of the Propulsion Integration Lab (PIL)/Engine Generator Lab (EGL) fr om June 2004 to August 2004, and 3) change the expected delivery month of the Automotive Test Rigs (ATR) from January 2005 to February 2005. Below is the original synopsis with the above three changes incorporated: FABRICATE AND TEST PROTOTYPE ENGINES FOR FUTURE COMBAT (FCS) MANNED GROUND VEVICLES (MGV)  General Dynamics Land Systems will be issuing a Request for Proposal (technical, management and cost) to qualified engine suppliers or manufacturers (hereinafter  referred to as Subcontractor to mature an engine design, develop key accessories, fabricate, and test prototype hardware for the Manned Ground Vehicles (MGV) of the Future Combat Systems (FCS). The focus of this engine program shall be on engine application development, and not on base engine development.  The engine rated power shall be either 35 0 kW or 410 kW with an assembly weight wet no greater than 450 kg.  The assembly shall include basic engine assembly, Engine Control Module (ECM with associated harnesses, sensors, actuators, BIT/BITE, tactical planning, and maintenance logbook functions),  air intake ducting from air cleaner, integral cooling system components (coolant pump(s), oil pumps), water cooled charge air cooler system including ducting and plumbing (diesel only), oil sump and scavenge system, lubricant filtration system, lubricant sampling system, high pressure fuel pump and fuel injection equipment, electrical connectors, exhaust manifolds (diesel only), recuperator (turbine only), mounts, thermostats, cold start system components, turbocharger(s) as applicable. The subcontractor will complete design, development, analysis, fabrication, qualification, and delivery of two (2) engines for Propulsion Integration Lab (PIL)/ Engine Generator Lab (EGL) in August 2004, two (2) engines rated at 100% power for Automotive T est Rigs (ATR) in February 2005, and approximately 50 prototype engine starting in August 2005 through November 2006 at a rate of approximately 3 per month.  The PIL/EGL engines are needed to support generator and propulsion integration efforts and shall h ave all electrical interfaces functional and generate a minimum of 75-80% of the rated power (100% perferred).  The engines referred to as prototypes, will be in a production ready configuration.  Depending on the success of the MGV program, additional 500 0+ engines (production and spares) may be required over a 10-year period, with continued system technical support over a 30-year period.  Delivery of these engines for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) may start as early as 2007. Subcontract award does no t guarantee award of or participation in a follow-on production contract. The engine developed under this subcontract will be part of the hybrid electric drive propulsion system for the MGV.  The MGV includes several vehicle variants.  All variants will use a common engine, with exhaust for engine combustion and propulsion cooli ng air exiting to the rear of the vehicle. The engine exhaust may also be used to generate water for the crew.  The engine will be designed to meet or exceed requirements for all variants.  The engine's primary function is to drive a 600V AC generator (per manent or induction type).  It is anticipated there is no direct mechanical coupling of the engine to the vehicle drive system or suspension/sprockets or wheels nor engine driven accessories other than those directly needed for engine operation.  The gener ator will be used as a primary starter for the engine and will be used to absorb excess power (back-drive) during regenerative brakin g.  The generator is excluded from this RFP. All requests for a copy of the Request for Proposal shall be made to Mr. Craig Rudder at e-mail address rudderc@gdls.com. additonally, he may be contacted at(586)825-4062.

<DESC>CORRECTION: THE TITLE SHOULD READ INDFINITE DELIVERY, INDEFINITE QUANTITY MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR DESIGN-BUILD PROJECTS UNDER ROICC NEW ORLEANS. ALSO, PHASE I WILL BE ISSUED ON OR ABOUT 08 SEPTEMBER 2003 vs 24 SEPTEMBER 2003. PHASE I PROPOSALS WILL BE DUE AROUND 08 OCTOBER 2003 vs 24 OCTOBER 2003. ALL OTHER INFORMATION BELOW REMAINS UNCHANGED.
THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION FOR TWO CONTRACTS, AND POTENTIAL SET-ASIDES FOR ONE 8A AND ONE HUBZONE ELIGIBLE CONCERN FOR THE REMAINING TWO CONTRACTS. This procurement will result in the award of up to four separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Design-Build Construction Contracts for general building type projects--new construction and renovations--including but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facilities, training, family housing, dormitory, community support facilities and industrial buildings, mechanical and electrical improvements, and civil construction--grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water-storage and transmission--, for the Department of Defense activities in the State of Louisiana managed by the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, New Orleans, LA. The work will be concentrated at, but not limited to, the following locations:  Naval Support Activity, Naval Air Station, New Orleans, LA; Defense Information Systems Agency, Slidell, LA and other locations within their area of responsibility. Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal--RFP--procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, cost or price or other factors considered. Each contract is for one year with two option years. The estimated value of all contracts is $30 million. Projects will vary in size from around $100,000 to $3 million with the average project in the $500,000-$2 million range. Proposers will be required to submit a bid bond for the seed project, and for each task order.  This procurement will include potential set-asides for one 8a and one HUBZone eligible contractor. These proposers will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I. If the 8a and-or the HUBZone proposers are not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the solicitation will be reverted to unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders would be responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. Task orders would require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement. Projects would also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract. All professional disciplines shall be registered and-or certified in their discipline. In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers--design-build teams--based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Technical Qualifications--including proposed subcontractors--, Management Approach and Small Business Subcontracting Effort. Phase I design-build factors relate to the three year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects described above. Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. In Phase II, the selected Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals. Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals would not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of construction. Cost and Price proposal may include total cost or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects if it is in the Government's best interest. The other IDIQ contract--s--will be awarded to the design-build offeror--s--who provide the best overall proposal--s--for all seed projects after those offerors who have been awarded a seed project--s--have been removed from further competition. A minimum guarantee of $25,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract--s--where a seed project is not awarded. The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror--s--are awarded no task orders over the three year contract term. Future task orders would be competed among the firms that were awarded an IDIQ contract, with each task order awarded based on best value to the Government. The seed project--s--for this solicitation are unconfirmed at this time. Due to funding constraints, authorization to advertise the seed project--s--is not expected until after the Phase I portion of this solicitation is completed. It is possible that no seed project--s--will be authorized during this fiscal year and Phase II competition would be postponed until at least one suitable seed project is identified. FOR SPECIFICATIONS: The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only. Phase I will be issued on or about 24 September 2003. Phase I proposals will be due around 24 October 2003.  PHASE II WILL BE ISSUED AT A LATER DATE. Both Phase I and Phase II, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil. Prospective Offerors MUST register on the web site. The official plan holders' list will be maintained and can be printed from the web site. Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading. This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION. Offerors MUST be registered in the Contractors Central Registration--CCR--in order to participate in this procurement. The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov. For inquiries about proposals due or number of amendments issued, contact Shirley Shumer at 843-820-5923. Technical inquiries MUST be submitted in writing 15 days before proposals are due to the address listed above, or emailed to Janet Eadie at eadiejg@efdsouth.navfac.navy.mil.

<DESC>Questions and Answers:

1)	Q - Will the Department of State extend the deadline for submission of proposals beyond 12:00 noon (Washington, DC time) on August 26, 2002?
	A - No.  While the Department has received a handful of requests for extensions, all of which were given full consideration, a decision has been made to NOT extend the proposal submission deadline.  The Department arrived at this decision after carefully weighing potential benefits and risks, concluding that such an extension would not be practicable.  This decision is final.

2)	Q - How do copyright restrictions apply to this project?
	A - This project will be for internal Government use only.  The service will be analogous to print news clipping services already provided to the Government by several private firms and other Government agencies.  Thus, any applicable copyright restrictions will be commensurate with those that apply to these other "clipping" services.

3)	Q - What would be a typical collection time profile over a 24-hour period for one broadcast source (for example, 30 minutes at 7:00 am local time, 30 minutes at 12:00 pm local time, and 60 minutes at 6:00 pm local time)?
	A - The two hours of coverage per channel per day are left entirely to discretion of the offeror, as set forth in their proposal.

4)	Q - What is the expected timeframe for viewing a demonstration of a fully-functional prototype system?
	A - The successful contractor must provide the Department with a fully-functional system as soon as possible after contract award.  The estimated time-frame for establishing a fully-functional system must be addressed in your proposal.

5)	Q - What is the purpose of the final distribution of the information in the system (for example, internal Department use only, use of multiple Government agencies, or distribution to the general public)?  This question will help determine the appropriate quality level of the translation.
	A - This information will be used for the Department of State's Office of Research analysis and reporting in support of other Government clients.  Excerpts will likely be used in these reports.  The quality of translation must be sufficient to judge the tone of the covered broadcasts (i.e. what "slant" does a particular news story take).  In order to be useable by the Department, accuracy of the final transcripted, translated broadcast must be at least 80% of the original broadcast.

6)	Q - The solicitation states: "Initially, four users will require access."  How many users would the system expand to when in full production?
	A - While this answer is somewhat dependent upon the quality of the final service, the Department does not envision more than ten users when the system is in full operation.

7) 	Q - Would there be any restrictions on the selected company from offering the service outside the Department of State (i.e. other Government agencies, private firms, etc.)?
	A - The Department does not currently foresee any such restrictions.

<ARCHDATE>08292003
<CONTACT>Cynthia  Molnar, Contract Specialist, Phone 5058455170, Fax 5058456491, Email cmolnar@nnsi.doe.gov
<DESC>Wackenhut Services, Inc. (WSI) has a requirement to provide role players Level 1 and role players Level 2 for a variety of courses.  The role players are an integral part of the practical exercises for each course.  Role players must be able to work in adverse conditions, follow scripts that are provided, and work in a translated environment with foreign nationals.

Role Players Level 1 Requirements
Role players Level 1 are actors who assist in the classes by interacting with the delegates.  Role players do not need simunitions experience or specialized backgrounds.

Emergency Medical Interventions for Mass Casualties (EMIMCS)
During the 5 week course, 84 role players are required for a total of 573 role player hours.

Role player for this course are required to act as victims of a terrorist attack (nuclear, biological or chemical) or show signs of general trauma from a gunshot or from the effects of an explosive device.

Role players are given physical assessments (reguires touching of body from head to toe) by the students and receive treatments such as immobilization and bandaging.

Some exercises expose role players to cold and heat extremes and require them to remain in character for extended periods of time.  Other exercises require role players to become wet with simulated blood or to become wet with water to simulate loss of bladder control or wet with simulated vomit.

Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)
During the 4 week course, 24 role players are required for a total of 150 role player hours.

The role players used for this class are an integral part of the decontamination process performed by the students.  To make the scenarios more realistic, role players are given a script on what is expected during their performance.

There are currently eight(8) scenarios embedded in the WMD course inclding chemical, biological, radiological and explosive incidents.

During the process of the scenarios, at times clothing needs to be cut off of the role players, so WSI suggests that the role players wear swim wear under their clothing.

Role Players Level 2 Requirements

Specialized role players Level 2 are required to have extensive backgrounds in investigative techniques for the TIC course and simunitions training for the VIP Protection and the OST course.

Officer Survival Training(OST)
The Officer Survival Training course (OST) utilizes seven (7) role players for approximately 12 hours over two afternoons and an evening.  

OST role players must possess the following attributes:
     Basic understanding of firearms safety concepts
     Ability to conceptualize and follow instructions
     Basic understanding of police tactics, cover and concealment
     Familiarity with weapons maniputlation, loading and 
       unloading, reloading, presentation, shooting and 
       malfunction clearance

Terrorism Investigation Course (TIC)
The role players are interspersed throughtout the two week course, working a total of 50 hours.  The role players are briefed the day before the actual exercise begins and given written instructions regarding their roles.  During the course of the practical exercise, the role players act as victims, witnesses and subjects for the interviewing and interrogation portion of the class.  Role players are also used as the subjects of a physical surveillance exercise.

The role players should have the following abilities:
     Basic understanding of law enforcement concepts
     Basic understanding of police interviewing and interrogation
        procedures
     Ability to perform under several hours of continuous
        activity such as, walking, talking and avoiding detection

VIP Protection Course (VIP)
The VIP Protection course utilizes a total of 20 role players in four separate practical exercises.

During these practical exercises the students will be engaged in various attack scenarios that will require them to demonstrate principles learned in the earlier presented scenarios.

The scenarios listed below are a good representation of the types of scenarios that the role players could be requuired to perform.

     Knife diversion followed by gun attack
     Medical emergency such as a heart atttack
     Explosive device planted at speech site

Safety

All role players must have an acceptable level of physical fitness so as not to succumb to temperature extremes associated with outdoor exposure.  In addition, role players should be free of communicable diseases since they will be in close contact with foreign students

All role players who will participate in training involving the simunitioins Dye Markeing Cartridge (DMC) shall be given a briefing on the use and limitations of this tool by a member of the NNSI/WSI Live Fire Range staff prior to participating in any DMC training activities.

<CONTACT>Marianne C. Shuster, Contract Specialist, 973-724-4260
<DESC>The U.S. Army Office of the Project Manager (PM) Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) is conducting a market survey to identify existing 155mm Howitzer  Artillery-launched Sensor Fuzed Munitions (SFM).  The operation and  capabilities of these SFM must be analogous to the M898 SADARM.  (The following  website provides a description of the M898 SADARM, http://fas.org/man/dod- 101/sys/land/sadarm.htm.)  The U.S. Army employed the M898 SADARM during  Operation Iraqi Freedom with great success.  However, the remaining stockpile  is only a fraction of the original quantity.  Thus, the U.S. Army wants to  insure 155mm SFM supply alternatives to alleviate this shortfall.  This  identification of supply alternatives must minimize schedule, cost and risk  impacts.  Respondents must comply with the following criteria:  1)  The SFM  must have a demonstrated full-up-system capability of defeating armored  vehicles.  “Full-up-system” means the round is fired from a U.S. Army/NATO  howitzer, flies to the designated target area, and effectively engages and  kills armored vehicle targets stationed in that target area, and 2) The SFM  must have an active production capacity of their SFM nominee.  “Active  production capacity” means the manufacturer(s) involved in the production of  the SFM are currently making the parts and sub-assemblies needed as well as the  complete projectile.  Interested firms should provide their qualifications and  capabilities within twenty (20) calendar days of this published notice via  email to mshuster@pica.army.mil.  Provide manufacturer’s name, address, point- of-contact with telephone number and email address, size of business  (small/large), and country where the facility is located.  This Market Survey  is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for  proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government.   Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey.  SEE NOTE 25.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS  prepared by the National Park Service in accordance with the format in FAR  subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in  this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes  are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  Solicitation No N5023030010.  is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and  will be awarded as single award contract . SITE VISIT will Be Aug. 29,  2003 @ 10:30 am . The North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS) is 115310 the size standard is 15 million dollars. The  solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect  through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-05. The solicitation item is as  follows: Scope of Work:  Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park PROJECT LOCATIONS:  Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park is located in the Marietta  Metropolitan area.  Developed areas surrounding the park and in holding  residential and industrial areas have developed into a Wildland Urban  Interface sprawl.  This has created the need to develop defensible fuel  breaks to reduce wild fire threats to adjacent properties.  A fuel  brake 60 feet wide 25,435 feet long will be developed.  The majority of the  work will be conducted on the southern end of the park.  At Battlefield  Road a fuel break will begin at an existing fuel break and proceed  south to southern end of the park at Powder Springs Road.   Work will then  begin approximately .5 miles up from previous ending point and precede  northward working around private homes and 2 subdivisions located off  of Cheatham Hill Road. Park map will be  provided detailing location where work is to be  completed. SCOPE OF WORK:  The contractor shall furnish all equipment, labor, materials,  transportation, etc. necessary to remove approximately 30 acres of unnaturally  heavy fuels accumulations at Kennesaw Mountain Nation Battlefield Park.  The work of this contract will consists of removing hazardous  trees/fuels build-up which pose a significant safety /fire risk to the public  and private homeowners adjacent to the park.  In designated areas all  ground fuels within sixty feet of the Park boundary will be removed from  the woodlands, bucked, and lopped to manageable lengths and moved from  the 60-foot fuel brake.  Trees and brush 6" in diameter or smaller will  be cut flush with the ground and removed from the fuel brake.   Dead  trees that are standing will be cut down and limbed completely.   Trees  that have already fallen will be reduced, limbed and laid on the ground.   Where there are high concentrations of large dead trees that have been  felled one on the other these will need to be reduced and scattered to  prevent continuous large fire fuels. Pruning remaining trees in the  fuel brake requires branches to be cut at least ten feet from the ground  this will interrupt the fire's path.  Pruning cuts should be clean and  smooth, avoiding flush cuts and stubs.  All limb wood and slash may be  chipped if contractor chooses this as a more cost effective method.   In  the event that a chipper cannot reach the area, limb wood and slash  will be dragged into the interior of the park and scattered.   With-in these locations are sensitive areas such as historic  earthworks.   The contractor is required to be keenly aware of the earthwork  areas.  National Park Service historian will mark all earthworks with-in  the designated work area.  Work in these areas will be sensitive as not  to disturb the historical significance of these resources.  Special care  should be taken when cutting and removing trees and brush from  earthworks.    INSPECTION CONTROL OF WORK:   An NPS representative will be available to make determinations on any  questions of boundary location and tree/brush removal.  Standing dead  pine woody material of any DBH will be cut. Much of this will consist of  dead pine trees killed by the Southern Pine Beetle.  All limb wood less  than 6 inches in diameter from cut material that is not removed may be  chipped if the equipment can reach the site.  All material cut under  this contract, including logs, firewood, and merchantable pulpwood, shall  become the property of the contractor.  If contractor chooses removing  vegetation and downed woody material from the park it must be disposed  in an approved location.  Much of the work area is not accessible by  vehicle or heavy equipment.  Accessibility issues will be discussed with  NPS representative and a determination made as to what is accessible to  equipment.  For sections of the work site that cannot be reached by  equipment, hand removal is required. Larger logs can be cut to manageable  lengths and scattered with in fuel brake.  Stump removal and grinding  is not included in this contract.  Any material that is chipped will be  spread to avoid piles of chips/sawdust. PROJECT OVERVIEW BACKGROUND: Objectives: 1. Reduce fuel accumulation along the boundary between the Park and  subdivision in order to provide adequate defensible space to lessen the  risk of wildfire. 2. Remove heavy concentrations of storm damaged and pine beetle killed  fuels from areas adjacent to subdivisions and park motor roads. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: 1. Cutting restrictions -dead standing timber of any size with-in  60-foot fuel brake will be cut and removed as allowed in scope of work. 2. Equipment restrictions - equipment will be of size and durability to  cut, chip and haul woody materials removed from area.  Any equipment  used along the wood line shall be low impact type and be used in a manner  to restrict damage to the areas.  NO roads or other accessibility  points shall be constructed no matter how temporary in nature. 3. Hauling restrictions:  Units shall not be operated at speeds  exceeding the posted limit.  Trucks and other heavy equipment shall be  confined to the limits of the project on the park road.  Hauling of materials,  supplies, and equipment over the park road, other than within the  limits of the project, will not be permitted except as is necessary to  perform the required work. 4. Chipping: Limbwood and slash may be chipped or hauled and removed  from the park by the contractor.  If chipping is desired the following  constraints will be followed.  (1) All chipped materials will have a  depth not to exceed 1 inch.  (2) The chipping location will be changed  frequently to achieve a uniform distribution of chips (no piles). (3) Any  damage caused by the chipper, wheel ruts, etc. will be rehabilitated to  the satisfaction of the COR. 5. Dumping: In areas where contractor chooses hauling the materials to  be removed to an appropriate site for disposal.  No illegal or  unauthorized dumping of the material is acceptable.  The contractor will be  responsible for paying all of the costs associated with the dumping and  any fees or fines associated with the hauling and dumping of the removed  materials.      6. Scattering:  This will be done under very controlled conditions and  monitored by park staff.   The objective will be to remove the fine  fuels from along the boundary so they pose less of a fire hazard.  Fuels  must be scattered and not piled to prevent fuel build-ups or "jackpots".   They must be taken at least 50 feet into the interior of the park and  then scattered. 7.

The square to round transition for the exhaust opening on the blower shall be schedule 10 stainless pipe 2 ½" ID x 3" long.  P.  TESTING:  A first article (a completely assembled prototype of two isolators and support rack) shall be constructed and approved before the remainder of the items on the delivery order is shipped.  Upon approval of the prototype units, the Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor a release order (a statement acknowledging acceptance of the first article and requesting shipment of the balance of the delivery order).  The Contracting Officer will test the first article unit for (1) compliance with these specifications, and (2) air leakage.  The tests will be conducted within seven days after delivery.  This leakage test will be done with all ports sealed and with dry, clean gaskets.  The isolator unit shall be pressurized to 2" W.C. with air.  The air supply shall be turned off and the isolator static pressure measured after 15 minutes.  A leakage of 25% of the original pressure will be the maximum acceptable leakage.  In the event the first article is not approved due to a minor defect (one not likely to reduce materially the usability of the unit for its intended purpose, or is a departure from the established standards having little bearing of the effective use or operation of the unit), the Contractor shall modify, repair, or replace the article for a subsequent inspection within 30 days of receipt of notice of rejection.  In the event the first article is not approved due to a major defect (one likely to result in failure, or to reduce materially the usability of the unit for its intended purpose), the Contractor shall replace the article for a subsequent inspection within 30 days of receipt of notice of rejection.  The Contractor shall give the Contracting Officer a schedule of corrective actions anticipated by the Contractor within ten days of receipt of the notice of rejection.  Acceptance of defective material is not permitted under any circumstances.  The isolators not passing this test will be returned at the Contractor’s expense.  The approved first article will serve as the manufacturing model and count as part of the production quantity.  Failure of the first article to pass inspection after three testing procedures (either to modified or repaired first articles or to additional first articles) will be indicative of the Contractor’s inability to meet the contract requirements and shall constitute grounds for termination for default in accordance with the termination for cause clause of this contract.  Q.  DELIVERY:  The Government requires delivery of a fully operational cage ready for first article testing within 45 days of contract award.  When the unit is shipped, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer notice that it has been shipped and the anticipated delivery date.  After first article testing is completed, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor of the results of the inspection through a release order, upon receipt of which the Contractor should proceed with the delivery of units remaining on the initial delivery order.  These units shall be delivered within 60 days of the receipt of the release order.  (vii) Delivery shall be FOB Destination, 934 College Station Road, Athens, Georgia, within 60 days of contract award.  Acceptance shall be made at destination.
