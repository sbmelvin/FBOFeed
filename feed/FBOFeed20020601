<DESC>The 311th Human Systems Program Office, (311 HSW/YA), Brooks AFB, Texas is preparing to release the final Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) Program, System Development & Demonstration with Production Options (SDD/Production) contract on 17 June 2002.  The draft RFP is located in the attached files of this website .  Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements thereto.  We anticipate a single award for the SDD/Production effort; production would be an option on the SDD contract. A small business set-aside is not considered appropriate for this program effort.  The SDD contract will feature a cost-plus award fee (CPAF) pricing arrangement. For the Production Options, the offerors are required to submit proposals under a Fixed Price Incentive (Successive Targets) arrangement; in accordance with FAR 16.403-2 (a)(2), the parties will negotiate a fixed price contract arrangement after the completion of the Physical Configuration Audit.  The estimates for SDD and the production options are $25 and $282 million respectively.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 336413.  The contract award will be based on full and open competition.  In order to maximize opportunities to all offerors, potential offerors were notified of program progress and given instructions how to optimize their potential for successful award of the SDD/Production competition.  On 9 May 01, the San Antonio RFP and Acquisition Highway (SARAH) and Commerce Business Daily Notice to Offerors posted information to all offerors, excluding the current Program Development and Risk Reduction (PDRR) contractors, that requested the following items by the listed dates in order to be a potential offeror for the SDD/Production contract: Funding documentation to support their pro-rata share of Government Testing - 30 Jun 01 System Design Information (Conceptual Drawings) - 30 Sept 01 14 Test samples each Material - 31 Oct 01 25 Prototypes - 30 Jan 02 . During SDD, the successful offeror will translate their design approach into a stable, interoperable, producible, supportable, and cost-effective design; validate the affordability and producibility of the system, prove the production processes; and demonstrate system performance to specifications through testing. The proposal evaluation will rely substantially on results of the prototype unit Government testing.  Therefore, offerors who were unable to submit their prototypes and their share of the Government test funds, will not meet minimum criteria in the selection process.  During the  next phase (SDD) the following activities will occur: Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E), man-rating, safe-to-fly certification, Operational Testing &Evaluation (OT&E), technical data development, provisioning of spare parts, Functional Configuration Audit (FCA), Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) and Production Readiness Review. The Government will base its decision to enter production on the results of DT&E, OT&E, production readiness, and system affordability. Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) principles will be used to meet technical requirements at a price the user is willing to pay. Teaming or partnering within industry allows for the most promising technical design and expertise. Please indicate how teaming or partnering will be considered in your approach.  We anticipate releasing the RFP on or about 17 Jun 02.  The RFP will be issued via the SARAH homepage internet address:  http://sarah.brooks.af.mil/  (Click on 311 HSW Human Systems Program Office.  Find solicitation number - F41624-02-R-1007 and click on it.  Scroll down to the bottom and click on the files link.)  Information concerning this acquisition will be updated at this location   Offerors who determine that the technical requirements of this draft RFP require clarification in order to permit submittal of a responsive proposal shall submit all questions in writing via e-mail to the POC only.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. Michael Higgins at (937) 255-6005.  All proposals must be received by 4 p.m. CST, on the closing date.  The closing date will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the RFP.  The anticipated closing date is 19 Jul 2002.  It is the contractor?s responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance and proposal due dates.  Proposals must be addressed to Ms. Ynuaka Newsome, Contracting Officer; 311th Human Systems Program Office / YACN; 7909 Lindbergh Landing; Brooks AFB, TX  78235-5306.  Responses and inquiries may also be directed to the Contracting Officer, at ynuaka.newsome@brooks.af.mil, voice 210-536-4571, or fax 210-536-2993.
