<DESC>This is a synopsis notice for commercial services as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 5.2, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
<p>The Government intends to solicit using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). At this time the&nbsp;Government has determined that only one reasonably available source will satisfy the agency requirements.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may identify their interest and submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency except that foreign participation is NOT permitted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and does not constitute a solicitation. However, all proposals received within the window of publication for this synopsis will be considered by the U.S. Air Force. Any costs incurred by an interested company will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force has a requirement for a service contract to support connectivity between Hill AFB and the Little Mountain Test Facility in Ogden Utah. The overall objective is to install, activate, test, and maintain two (2) individual Digital Signal, Level 1 (DS-1) circuits to connect the Land Mobile Radio Trunking System repeater site to Hill AFB and for voice services.</p>
<p>This noncompetitive contract action is justified based on the existing communication structure. Currently only CenturyLink communication lines exist and any other contractor would have to install new communication lines which would be costly and time consuming. There were no viable sources found willing to install a new communications infrastructure between Hill AFB and the Little Mountain Test Facility. Award to any other vendor would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling mission requirements and would result in substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award this requirement as a noncompetitive contract action to CenturyLink (formerly known as Qwest Government Services Inc.) - Cage Code: 5WBB3. The proposed contract will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) service contract with a Period of Performance (PoP) total estimated at 24&nbsp;months from the date of award (includes 1 (one) 12 month PoP&nbsp;base year for installation and network service&nbsp;and 1 (one) 12 month&nbsp;PoP&nbsp;option year of continual network service). This will be accomplished via a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Performance will be from Little Mountain Test Facility, 12000 W. 12th St Ogden Utah 84404 to 6060 Gum Lane, Hill Air Force Base, UT 84056-5713</p>
<p>Respondents are requested to specify whether they are large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned SB, Hubzone SB, Veteran-owned SB, or Service-disabled veteran- owned SB, and whether U.S. or foreign-owned firm.</p>
<p>Be advised that periodic access to the websites listed above is essential for obtaining updated documentation and the latest information regarding the procurement.</p>
<p>Questions and comments should be emailed to Brittney.Sonnier@us.af.mil or Michelle.Esquivel@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>Fabrication of CMCs for propulsion components and structures is costly, complex, and requires long production processing times. The goal of this inquiry is to ascertain ways to increase yield, rate, and capability while reducing cost.
<p>The manufacturing challenges corresponding to turbine engines and air vehicle structures have potential overlap but may also differ greatly. Respondents should convey their capabilities for the manufacture of CMCs with applications in mind for these material systems; Al2O3-Al2O3 (Oxide-Oxide), SiC/SiC, C/SiC, and any close variants of these containing SiOC or SiNC in each category below.</p>
<p>Ceramic fiber and matrix raw materials production<br />Ceramic fiber coating<br />Matrix densification<br />Environmental Barrier Coatings for CMCs<br />Fabrication of complex shapes, particularly in near-net-shape<br />Machining of CMCs (including surface finishing processes)<br />Assembly of CMC systems from smaller CMC parts <br />Methods to join CMCs to metallic components via mechanical fastening or bonding<br />In-process monitoring and inspection<br />Non-destructive evaluation</p>
<p>Additionally, the Air Force requests information on specific concepts intended to: increase yield, quality, reproducibility, or process robustness; employ process modeling and simulation; develop other innovative manufacturing concepts not listed above towards CMC production and cost reduction. Respondents should include perceived risks, manufacturing maturation priorities, and any manufacturing readiness (MRL) information.</p>

<CONTACT>Scott Bryan, Project Engineer, Phone (937) 904-7082, Email Scott.bryan@us.af.mil
<DESC>For an enterprise wide implementation of VAM technologies to aircraft maintenance four areas of specific interest areas are:
<p>(1)  Content Development. Content is defined as the computer generated visualizations for use in a VAM device. This information may be spatially registered to the physical environment or may be similar to a "billboard" of information or task list. A user would be totally immersed in (virtual) a training use case, or computer generated content could be overlaid onto real world views (augmented or mixed).  Cost effective solutions for VAM content creation are needed across the Air Force enterprise. The sheer magnitude of aircraft preventive and remedial maintenance tasks will require innovative crowd sourcing of AR  content development by airmen. The content must be able to be developed by non-programmers, and not be dependent on digital models of legacy aircraft systems</p>
<p>(2)  Content Approval and Management. Development of solutions for vetting and managing VAM content are also needed. Ensuring that the latest technical data is used by airmen is just as critical when using VAM as other more traditional media. Methods and processes to vet VAM content will be critical in the application of this technology across the Air Force enterprise.</p>
<p>(3) Open Modular Enterprise Solutions. With many potential use cases for VAM, the types of AR devices the Air Force will need is anticipated to be varied. A risk assessment will need to be done for each use case and the device deemed safest for that application should be selected. This includes physical safety of the maintainer and cybersecurity for Air Force computer networks and data. Any solution should be device agnostic and allow for the adsorption of new technical capabilities as they enter the market.</p>
<p>(4) VAM Business Case. Each use case will have an associated monetary impact from application of VAM technologies. First time quality and process throughput are key metrics when describing the business case for additional implementations of VAM technologies.</p>

<ARCHDATE>08182018
<CONTACT>Andrea Helbach, Project Engineer, Phone (937) 255-0083, Email Andrea.helbach@us.af.mil
<DESC>The Air Force is specifically interested in the following four areas:
<p>Current State of the Art. The Air Force would like to understand the current state of the art regarding composite (organic matrix and ceramic matrix) consolidation, debulking and bagging.  Information on how debulking schedules are determined and manufacturing plans for new composite component bagging are accomplished will be useful in determining the baseline state of the art. The Air Force would also like to understand whether innovative approaches (reusable bagging, automation, modeling etc.) have been attempted and the degree to which they were successful including implementation in a manufacturing representative environment. In the responses, the resin and fiber reinforcement and the complexity of the component should be documented as approaches are known to vary across material systems and geometric complexities.</p>
<p>Current Manufacturability Challenges and Business Case. The Air Force would like to understand the current manufacturability challenges associated with consolidation, debulking and bagging. Cycle time, labor hours, part to part variability, rework, bagging consumables utilization, challenges with finding and training production personnel, and production learning curve should all be addressed. This information will be used to determine a business case for quantifying and addressing these challenges.</p>
<p>Innovative Approaches. AFRL would like to receive ideas on innovative approaches for consolidation, debulking and bagging. These ideas should address cycle time reductions, quality improvements, reduction in consumable materials, reduction in rework etc. Of particular interest to the Air Force is incorporating an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) approach to consolidation to reduce the trial and error nature of the current practices. Development and demonstration of these approaches should be discussed as well.</p>
<p>Future Plans. As the Air Force determines the utility and business associated with developing the above innovative approaches, also of interest will be in any current plans and future investment in innovative consolidation approaches. Technologies that can be considered pre-competitive in nature and open to shared investment are of great interest to the Air Force.</p>

<CONTACT>Andrea Helbach, Project Engineer, Phone (937) 255-0083, Email Andrea.helbach@us.af.mil
<DESC>The Air Force is specifically interested in the following four areas:<br />Current Manufacturing Cost Models. AFRL would like to understand the current manufacturing cost modeling state of the art existing at universities, institutes, consortiums, companies, and other government organizations.  Information required for this baseline includes, but is not limited to:  method for manufacturing cost modeling; incorporation of any structural performance metrics, tool maturity level of current manufacturing cost models; type of model (Excel, web-based, etc.); components of the cost model (raw materials, tooling, capital costs, procured quantity, labor hours, cycle time etc.); visualization tools of cost versus performance and validation of cost and structural performance to date.
<p>Manufacturing Cost Model Future Development. AFRL is interested in how current cost models could be further developed or concepts for new model developments.  The information required for future development of cost models is the same as the current SOTA  information in the paragraph above.</p>
<p>Structural Performance. If a future AF program decides to use this materials and manufacturing cost-performance tool, coupons and components will be fabricated and tested to validate the model. AFRL would like to understand recommended methods and coupon and subscale-level component quantities for testing and validating structural performance (to be assessed in conjunction with processing cost).  AFRL is interested in the most appropriate coupon-level and subscale-level components and tests for rapidly assessing structural performance and enable quick screening of novel or nontraditional materials and processes.  These subscale-level components should include geometrical features of interest that have processing challenges or are critical for structural performance.</p>
<p>Future Plans for Cost Model Development. As the Air Force plans to develop cost models as described in Section 1, we are interested in any current capabilities, plans and future investments to develop similar cost and performance models.  Novel approaches connecting materials and manufacturing cost models and structural performance assessment data are also of interest to the Air Force along with visualization tools for rapid evaluation of cost and performance data.</p>

<DESC><strong>NOTE - the final NAICS Codes for TMAS 2 have not yet been determined; thus, four (4) separate FBO announcements are being publicized for the possible OASIS TMAS 2 Pools and their associated NAICS Codes. The potential Pools are Pool 3 (NAICS 541330 Exception A), Pool 5A (NAICS 541715 Exception B), Pool 5B (NAICS 541715 Exception C), and Pool 6 (NAICS 541715 Exception A). Once the NAICS determinations are made, an update will be posted on FBO to notify all interested parties of the OASIS SB Pools under which TMAS 2 will be awarded.</strong>
<p>The Air Force Test Center (AFTC) is in the preliminary stages of Acquisition Planning for the follow-on Technical Management Advisory Services (TMAS) contract, known as TMAS 2. The existing TMAS contracts were awarded as multiple task orders under General Services Agency's (GSA's) One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services (OASIS) Small Business (SB) multiple award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. AFTC intends to utilize GSA OASIS SB for TMAS 2. To keep Industry up to date on TMAS 2 and provide an overview of AFTC's mission, we will conduct an Industry Day on 14 August 2018 from 0800-1700 CDT at the Emerald Coast Convention Center, 1250 Miracle Strip Pkwy SE, Fort Walton Beach FL, 32548. In addition, the TMAS 2 Team will conduct one-on-one sessions on 15 August 2018 at the same location.<br /><br />Companies interested in attending this Industry Day must submit a Visit Request, via email (with the Subject Line, "TMAS 2 Industry Day), to Ms. Kionna Starks, kionna.starks@us.af.mil <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></strong> Mr. Sean Capik, sean.capik@eglin.af.mil. Email requests are due by close of business 7 August 2018. Visit Requests shall include the following information: Company Name, Address, CAGE Code, Attendee Name(s), the name, phone number and email address of the company's primary point of contact, and whether or not your company wants to participate in a one-on-one session.</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit questions regarding the TMAS 2 program prior to the Industry Day. Please submit your questions, via email (with Subject Line "TMAS 2 Industry Day), to holly.deuser@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Contractors unable to attend Industry Day will not be excluded from participating in future Industry Days or from competing for this effort, as long as they have a contract under the applicable OASIS Pool, once determined. Briefings presented during this Industry Day, as well as Questions and Answers, will be posted to FedBizOps following the actual event.</p>
<p>This office will continue to communicate through FedBizOps until Option 1 of the GSA OASIS SB has been exercised; at that time, all communication will be conducted via the applicable GSA OASIS SB Pools' under which the individual TMAS 2 task orders will be awarded.</p>

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. The purpose of the ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. <br />Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting office. Interested parties are invited to contact the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.</p>

Over the past 7 years, NASA ARC has partnered with the Department of Defense (DoD) on a number of activities focused on the development of small / medium satellites, satellite systems and subsystems, assembly integration and test, mission assurance, mission design, responsive manufacturing, ground operations, and launch services - often employing innovative approaches in order to accelerate acquisition timelines. Several of these capabilities are currently being met through a suite of contracts, awarded in 2010, under a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract titled "Rapid Response Space Works (RRSW)" and a multiple award IDIQ contract titled "Modular Space Vehicle (MSV)". The SSPEDI acquisition is envisioned to serve as a follow-on to the RRSW and MSV contracts in the continued pursuit of innovative and affordable approaches through basic research, applied research, and advanced development focused on, but not limited to, payloads, buses (i.e. spacecraft subsystems such as life support; attitude control; guidance, navigation and control; command and data handling; communications system and antennas; power; thermal control; propulsion; and structures and trusses), ground systems / infrastructure and launch systems. The requirement will be split into two requirements described below that are separate but interrelated:&nbsp;</span><br style="line-height: 18.6986px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;" /><br style="line-height: 18.6986px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;" /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">Space Solutions (SpS), a multiple award contract, focuses on the development of small to medium buses, payloads, and space vehicles based on specific technical and mission requirements for ORS.</span><br style="line-height: 18.6986px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;" /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">Primary place of performance will be: The Contractors' Facilities.</span><br style="line-height: 18.6986px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;" /><br style="line-height: 18.6986px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;" /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6866px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">A Request for Information (RFI) NNA16SSPEDI-L for this activity was posted on July 12, 2016.&nbsp;<br /></span>

When an individual with a disability has requested a reasonable accommodation to assist in the performance of a job, the employer, using a problem solving approach, should (1) Analyze the particular job involved and determine its purpose and essential functions; (2) Consult with the individual with a disability to ascertain the precise job-related limitations imposed by the individual's disability and how those limitations could be overcome with a reasonable accommodation; (3) In consultation with the individual to be accommodated, identify potential accommodations and assess the effectiveness each would have in enabling the individual to perform the essential functions of the position; and (4) Consider the preference of the individual to be accommodated and select and implement the accommodation that is most appropriate for both the employee and the employer. Once potential accommodations have been identified, the employer should assess the effectiveness of each potential accommodation in assisting the individual in need of the accommodation in the performance of the essential functions of the position. If more than one of these accommodations will enable the individual to perform the essential functions or if the individual would prefer to provide his or her own accommodation, the preference of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration.
<p>The Clinical Center (CC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires nursing assistant care for a disabled quadriplegic employee to provide reasonable accommodations. The NIH will issue this requirement with one (1) 12 month base period and three (3) 12 month option periods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement to lease a floating shock test platform (FSP) and ancillary lifting equipment, delivery, and incidental services for operations at Lake Glendora, Sullivan, IN 47882.

This is being sole sourced because Hi-Test Laboratories is the only facility capable of fabricating and leasing the floating shock test platform to the US Government in the required time-frame. The amount of time it would take to develop a technical data package makes it impractical to procure from a contractor other than Hi-Test Laboratories.</p>
<p>The Statement of Work (SOW), Specification, and drawing are attached to this Synopsis for reference.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract is a one year contract with two one-year lease option CLINs. Delivery is required by 15 May 2018. Inspection and Acceptance is to be at Destination with delivery F.O.B Destination: NSWC Lake Glendora Test Facility, Sullivan, IN 47882.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
