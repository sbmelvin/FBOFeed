Part I (Technical Section) of the formal, complete & detailed proposal will be the primary proposal for the evaluation, with Part II (Management) and III (Cost/Price) used as supplementary material at the discretion of the individual reviewer. The evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through an independent technical review of each using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: Quality and Technical Merit, Impact of the Project, and Capabilities and Experience.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR), hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, Inc. (SME), OneMine, Inc. to procure the Creation of Metadata Overlays and Incorporation of NIOSH/USBM Publications into OneMine.Org.
<p>Background:<br />OneMine, Inc. (www.OneMine.org) was created in early 2007 by the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration (SME). The goal of OneMine is to collect the most relevant and reliable aggregation of technical papers associated with mining and minerals in one, easy-to-navigate internet location. OneMine brings to the internet a uniquely valuable aggregation of the full-texts of high-impact mining research documents. OneMine is a collaborative effort that is placing the world's most comprehensive collection of mining and minerals based research into one location. Additional contributing societies adopted the concept quickly and these societies include American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers (AIME), the International Marine Minerals Society (IMMS), the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (SAIMM), SME and the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society (TMS). Each of the collaborating organizations has a made substantial contribution to the project.</p>
<p>Project Objective:</p>
<p>The articles contained in OneMine.org are available in a PDF format. The documents are searchable in OneMine.org through a complex company-owned metadata database. A metadata overlay is created by OneMine.org for each publication and is associated with that publication using OneMine.org's specialized software. The metadata database can only be accessed internally through OneMine.org and is not available for modification to entities outside of OneMine.org. In order to protect the pristine nature of the data and the overall accuracy of the information contained inside of the metadata database, the information is added, updated and reviewed only by OneMine.org personnel. Therefore, to create the required metadata for the NIOSH and USBM publications, this work can only be done by OneMine.org personnel.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2010-Q-12542. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with SME, OneMine, Inc. 8307 Shaffer Parkway, Littleton, CO 80127 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted. The government intends to exercise option years for this requirement; total period of performance would be two years.</p>

<DESC><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br />The Library of Congress intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on behalf of the National Defense University Library System to procure a new integrated library system to meet shared cataloging and resource needs. The NDU Library System consists of two academic libraries, the National Defense University Library at Ft Leslie J. McNair in Washington DC and the Ike Skelton Library at JFSC in Norfolk, VA. The project will replace the current Horizon software with a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product that will provide access through the web to library holdings, military resources, commercial resources and Internet resources both in the library at each campus and remotely for NDU students, staff, and faculty. The NDU Library manages the library system currently consisting of SirsiDynix Horizon 7.4.x, and Horizon Information Portal 3.0.8. The Horizon ILS supporting two libraries contains 310,000 bibliographic records, 509,000 items records and 6,000 borrowers. On average, 33,000 items are checked out monthly. In addition, the system houses the 171,000 MARC records of the Staff College Automated Military Periodical Index (SCAMPI) database which contains the indexed records from a variety of military and naval periodicals and other resources. The NDU Library currently uses the Ex Libris SFX OpenURL resolver and Metalib federated search, but will be switching to Serials Solutions 360 Services including Link and Search and the Summon Webscale Discovery tool. All responses to this synopsis shall be in writing. No telephone calls will be accepted. For information about the Library of Congress FEDLINK program, please visit www.loc.gov/flicc. The RFP will be posted on or about August 9, 2010</span></p>

<DESC>This project will be advertised under full and open (unrestricted) competition.

PROJECT DETAILS  This project will consist of bridge deck replacement on project AZ BOR CIBR 900(1),  located approximately 25 miles south of Blythe California, in La Paz County, AZ.  This project also consists of 1800 ft of widening on southbound US 93 on AZ BLM 93(1), Monolith Gardens Trailhead and Turnout, in Mohave County, Arizona.  The estimated price range for both projects is between $1,500,000 and $2,500,000.  

Lower Cibola Bridge Deck Replacement:

The Lower Cibola Bridge is located approximately 25 miles south of Blythe California, and approximately 100 miles north of Yuma, AZ.  The bridge spans across the Colorado River at River Mile 93.6 and is approximately 557 feet in length.  The bridge is wholly located in Arizona and within the Cibola National Wildlife Refuge.  

The project is for a deck replacement of the existing Lower Cibola Bridge.  Minor work included with the deck replacement are: replacement of the existing curb and railing across the bridge, paving approximately 100 feet of  the approaches to the bridge, guardrail installation at the bridge approaches, removal of road closure gates, replacement of navigation lighting,  installation of minor conduit, and jacketing the timber piles of the bridge.  There will be no substructure work other than the pile jacketing. 

The deck replacement will require the removal of the concrete deck, the steel railing, and existing minor conduit.  The removal of the deck will be tightly controlled; no explosives will be allowed or any heavy equipment to remove the slabs.  Deck removal will be by concrete saws and pneumatic or electric hammers of limited weights.  No debris will be allowed into the river. The Colorado River is a navigable waterway, and close coordination with the US Coast Guard will be required during construction.  

It is anticipated approximately 400 cuyds of concrete will be required for this project, approximately 100 tons of asphalt, approximately 1200 feet of steel bridge railing,  approximately 400 feet of guardrail, approximately 200 feet of pile jacketing, and over 1100 feet of conduit.  There is minor earthwork for installation of guardrail, approach road tie-ins, and general road reconditioning.  Minor turf establishment will be required for all disturbances as a result of the construction. The bridge will be closed during construction, however minor traffic control will be required. 

Pile jacketing will require an in depth underwater inspection of the piles and documented for the pile encapsulation. Underwater inspectors will be certified by the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) and will furnish all equipment, labor, licenses, permits, and insurance necessary to perform and complete the work.  Only a small percentage of pile encapsulation is anticipated, however and option will be included for all pile encapsulation should funding be available. 

Monolith Gardens:

The Monolith Gardens project consists of constructing approximately 1800 feet of acceleration and deceleration lane widening on southbound US 93 near milepost 69, approximately 3 miles northwest of Kingman Arizona.  The project also consists of reconstruction of the access to the BLM Monolith Gardens trailhead.  Principle work items include:  400 tons of asphalt pavement, 650 tons of aggregate base, 60 tons of asphalt friction course, 1,500 square yards of pavement milling, 200 cubic yards of roadway excavation, 750 feet of guardrail, and 1 cattle guard and metal gate.

PLEASE NOTE:   The Invitation for Bid will be available for download on or after July 30, 2010, from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov.   PLANS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD IN ADOBE (.pdf) FORMAT ONLY ON CFLHD's WEBSITE at http://www.cflhd.gov/contracting/construction/AdvertisedProjects.cfm  under the Project Name.

<DESC>RECOVERY - Kofax Capture Full Station Licenses and Software Upgrade Assurance.
Solicitation Number:
Agency: Department of the Treasury
Office: Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
Location: National Office Procurement (OS::A:P)

Synopsis:

RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO:  Quality Associates, Inc. (QAI), A SMALL BUSINESS, FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.  

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 Pub.L.111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of intent to issue a Request For Quote (RFQ) to purchase (14) Kofax Capture version 7.5 Full Station Licenses and one year of Software Upgrade Assurance (out-year maintenance for each of the 14 licenses).  Version 7.5 of the Kofax software is already installed and has been in use at the IRS since 2003.

The additional licenses are required for continued support of the Account Management System/Correspondence Imaging System (AMS/CIS) program.  The AMS/CIS program uses document scanners to digitize taxpayer correspondence for use by IRS Customer Service Representatives and Tax Examiners in responding to and resolving taxpayer inquiries/issues.  With the implementation of the Homebuyer Tax Credit enacted by the ARRA, the IRS has experienced increased volumes of taxpayer inquiries specifically relating to that initiative.  The additional licenses will enable more Customer Service Representatives and Tax Examiners to access the AMS/CIS systems and provide the additional assistance required by the increased volume of inquiries.

The Licenses and Software Upgrade Assurance will be acquired via a sole source Request for Quote (RFQ) issued on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  Version 7.5 of the Ascent Capture software is no longer publicly available.  However, Kofax has authorized QAI, a small business, to sell the version 7.5 software licenses to the government.  Since QAI is the only responsible source authorized to sell version 7.5 of the software licenses, the IRS does not anticipate receiving other offers.  A firm-fixed price contract will be awarded.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the TopicSeek LLC, 22 Russell Court, Irvine, California for the analysis of theoretical basis of topic mapping in order to validate and optimize the approach. Topicseek LLC will further characterize its theoretical underpinnings and to develop validation and evaluation approaches for this method. <br />The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), an Institute within the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recently funded a research categorization tool that uses Topic Modeling to perform text-based categorization of NIH grants, and a large scale graphing algorithm to display these them on a map organized spatially into their best-fit categories. This interactive tool is available to the public at http://www.nihmaps.org/. <br />Because of the nature of this analysis, the Institute seeks to employ the services of Topicseek LLC to further characterize its theoretical underpinnings and to develop validation and evaluation approaches for this method. TopicSeek LLC has served as a subcontractor in a prior NINDS requirement. The services as stated above are still required by the NINDS. TopicSeek LLC had already initiated analyses.<br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Period of performance is 12 months with the option for an additional 12 month period.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI1694734 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892-2080, and Attention: Susan A. Nsangou, Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) plans to procure, on a non-competitive basis, maintenance service with MEG International Services Ltd., 1850 Hartley Avenue, Coquitlam, BC, V3K 7A1, Canada. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 334510 and the size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />The NIMH Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Core Facility operates a 275 channel whole head CTF MEG system as a shared resource for the Intramural Research Programs (IRPs) of NIMH and NINDS. MEG is a sophisticated technique allowing high resolution recording of brain activity and as such forms a vital part of the neuroimaging research program. The instrument is in full time use by over forty (40) investigators as part of the program mission of the institutes. In order to insure availability of the system and reliability of patient data, a full time maintenance service is essential.<br /><br />The existing CTF MEG system was previously purchased from VSM MedTech System, Inc. and installed in 2002. MEG International Services Inc. is the successor company to VSM MedTech and as such hold all the proprietary knowledge of the CTF MEG system as well as the only known source of highly specialized and proprietary spare parts. To avoid disruption and delay to the many ongoing studies at the NIMH and NINDS, it is crucial to renew maintenance service for the 275-channel whole head CTF MEG through MEG International Services Ltd. It is determined that MEG International Services is the only source to provide the required service and no other sources would satisfy the agency's requirement.
<p>This is a firm fixed price type acquisition. Delivery is FOB Destination. Period of performance for this maintenance service is to be one year starting on or around August 8, 2010.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses submitted to ln18x@nih.gov on or before 2:00 PM ET July 26, 2010. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the government to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Please reference the announcement number NOI-1652414 on all correspondence.</p>

<SUBJECT>The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Biorepository
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-10-131
<RESPDATE>073010
<CONTACT>Rosanne S Wilson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-4433, Fax 301-443-0501, Email wilsonr@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with the Regents of the University of Michigan, DRDA for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Biorepository requirement.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their<br />interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen<br />days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the<br />Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the<br />discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of<br />determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be one base year with four option years (12 months for each performance year).</p>
<p>The SWAN Biorepository is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The Regents of the University of Michigan has continued to support the SWAN Biorepository activities related to receiving, storing, cataloging, preserving and distributing specimens to qualified investigators. The Contractor used a grant mechanism to design the repository and has assiduously provided services for the SWAN study over the past ten (10) years. The Contractor is the sole proprietor of the specific version of the inventory management system developed for and used by the SWAN repository; therefore, there is limited access to the data management system itself. The Contractor shall obtain services from SeraCare Life Sciences since the frozen biospecimens are housed in sixty-five (65) 80&#8304;C mechanical freezers at SeraCare. There are 1.7 million irreplaceable and highly perishable biological specimens (whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, extracted DNA, buccal cells, immortalized cells) contained in these freezers. To relocate the large repository from SeraCare's location can pose high risks by damaging the viability of cells and progress made over the last ten years of the SWAN study. The Regents of the University of Michigan has the unique capability to provide these required services to NIA for the SWAN BioRepository. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project makes competition unfeasible for this study. The objectives of the requirement are detailed below.<br /><br />Background and Purpose of the SWAN Biorepository:</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) continues to have a need for collecting, storing, monitoring and distributing blood, urine and DNA samples for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). The SWAN Biorepository has been supported since 2000 by a NIH research project grant mechanism (to the University of Michigan) which is separate from the SWAN clinical field sites, coordinating center and central laboratory. This requirement shifts the SWAN award mechanism from a grant to a contract.</p>
<p>SWAN is an ongoing multi-ethnic longitudinal study conducted by seven (7) clinical field sites, a data coordinating center and a central laboratory. It is designed to characterize the physiological and psychosocial changes that occur during menopause and beyond. SWAN has an extensive base of well characterized data and a repository of biological specimens from 3,300 African American, Chinese, Caucasian, Japanese and Hispanic women with over twelve years of annual follow-up visits that describe the endocrinology of the menopause transition and other factors relevant to midlife health and aging. The women, who ranged in age from 42 to 52 years at enrollment in 1996-97, will continue to be followed until they are 59-69 years old under an existing grant mechanism which expires in 2014 (and is separate from this repository requirement). SWAN has the capability to link the expansive biological, medical, social, behavioral, and demographic data it has collected over seventeen years to the development of both positive and deleterious health conditions, disorders and diseases in early old age. The major thematic areas of SWAN include 1) Physical Functioning; 2) Bone/Osteoporosis; 3) Cognitive Function/ Symptoms/ Mental Health; 4) Diabetes/Cardiovascular disease; 5) Physical functional performance and 6) Osteoarthritis,</p>
<p>The SWAN repository samples were meticulously collected and managed from 3,302 women from five race/ethnic groups followed annually prior to, during and after the menopausal transition. The SWAN Biorepository is an integral arm of SWAN intended to support and facilitate (the collection, processing and storage of new specimens from the ongoing study) and extend the SWAN core study to allow the efficient evaluation of new and untested existing hypotheses. The repository specimens consist of 578,000 serum, plasma and urine samples, one million urine samples from the Daily Hormone Study (an annual study of hormone patterns across a full menstrual cycle nested within the parent study) and 26,300 DNA samples (including 7,928 vials of immortalized cells from more than 1,500 participants). SWAN will continue participant follow-up visits and longitudinal data collection between 2010 and 2014. As a result, it is anticipated that an additional 113,792 new serum, plasma and urine samples will be generated for in the SWAN repository.</p>
<p>The SWAN Biorepository is a component of the SWAN Study. The purpose of the SWAN Biorepository is to provide a resource designed to receive, store, catalog, preserve and distribute specimens to qualified investigators. The SWAN Biorepository is needed to 1) support collection and storage of biological specimens from planned follow-up visits in the ongoing SWAN study; 2) provide for the continued management of the current biorepository specimens; 3) provide for continued administration of the review process for requests for specimens and management of specimen distribution; and 4) develop strategies to promote utilization of specimens. The contract shall provide and implement Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures for prospective evaluation of short and long term specimen management, including identification and removal of non-useful specimens as well as refinement of specimen cataloging.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-<br />SBSS-10-131 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-10-131.</p>
<p>The estimated contract award date will be on or about June 30, 2011.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City Division intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to A & J Manufacturing for 3 each, Medium Duty Rack, Model 60-D1-1062; 5 each, Power Panel, Model 150-274; 6 each, Sliding Shelf, Model 160-605; 9 each, Fixed Shelf, Model 150-005. The medium duty rack, panels and shelves being procured are required to fabricate the Amphibious Assault Direction System (AADS) workstations. These items are identical to the equipment that is currently installed. A & J Manufacturing is the only manufacturer of these items. These specific items have gone through the shock and vibration testing required for certification of their safety for shipboard installation. Purchase of any other manufacturer's equipment would require duplication of the shock and vibration testing already performed on this A & J Manufacturing equipment at a cost estimated to exceed the cost of the components being procured. Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to purchase this material from A & J Manufacturing. Delivery will be to NSWC PCD/CO NSAPC 101 Vernon Avenue Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7001. The basis for award is a responsive bid for a fair and reasonable price. Anticipated award date will be on or about 28 July 2010.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
Note:  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island is NOT accepting quotes or proposals via submission through NECO.
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport anticipates acquiring ten (10) Type 18B Periscope Outer Mast Assemblies along with corresponding data on a sole source basis from Kollmorgen Corporation, Electro-Optical Division, 346 King Street, Northampton, MA. The masts will be fabricated and tested per a statement of work and production drawings.  The masts and data will be acquired on a Firm Fixed Price basis.  The sole source is based on estimated duplication of costs for another contractor to obtain sufficient expertise to manufacture the Outer Mast Assemblies according to government approved SUBSAFE processes and procedures.  Further, as there is a considerable lead time in product, any delay would severely impact the operational capability of the submarine fleet.  See Note 22.

<a href="mailto:southerland.john@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement to address the following needs regarding passive sampling assessment of PM10-2.5 spatial variability for the Winter 2010 Cleveland Multiple Air Pollutant Study (CMAPS): analyze passive samples anddetermine spatial variability of PM10-2.5; compare satellite-based spatial model predictions versus measured PM10-2.5 and versus land-use regression models. 
This action is being pursued on a sole source basis. Dr. Thomas Peters (Principal Investigator) and his research group at the University of Iowa, including Dr. Naresh Kumar, were instrumental in the design and execution of 1) the passive sampling effort in Cleveland (Cleveland Scoping Study, summer of 2008) and 2) the summer 2009 CMAPS field study which is the model for the proposed winter 2010 passive sampling effort in the CMAPS. In the summer 2009 CMAPS, Dr. Peters and his research group generated a preliminary estimate of PM10-2.5 variability within the Cleveland urban area using Dr. Kumar's unique spatial model based on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from historic satellite data. The same approach will be used for this requirement to provide a comparison between PM10-2.5 concentration surfaces determined by passive samplers versus the University of Iowa spatial model. Dr. Peters' research group designed the passive sampler rain shelter which is being deployed in CMAPS and has pioneered methods for using passive samplers in the field and for the analysis of passive samples by optical microscopy. Dr. Peters' participation is essential in order to provide continuity and comparability of passive data between the Summer 2009 and Winter 2010 CMAPS studies. 
To the best of our knowledge, Dr. Peters expertise and working knowledge of the aforementioned establishes him as the only person that can provide services to complete all aspects of this requirement within the period of performance.  NAICS Code 541690 applies with a small business size standard of $7M.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Oregon State University, Central Analytical Laboratory (OSU/CAL), 3079 Ag-Life Sciences Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 to provide analysis of a total of 435 soil samples collected from a variety of EPA field site locations in the Oregon Coast and Cascade Mountain Ranges.  The samples will be analyzed for rock fraction, bulk density, up to six moisture retention values, and particle size.  OSU/CAL previously provided all analysis of soil samples collected under this specific research program which provides a benchmark for analyses performed in this study.Samples need to be processed in the same manner, by the same vendor to ensure quality of data and continuity of service.  Having these samples processed by a different vendor at this point in the study would affect the scientific quality of the data, introduce potential systematic bias that may cause erroneous conclusions to be drawn and render the results of analysis useless affecting the outcome of the entire project. Therefore, EPA believes this is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement for these particular samples.  The circumstance permitting ?other than full and open competition? at this time is FAR 13.501(a), "sole source".  The anticipated period of performance is a 12 month base period with four (4) additional 12 month option periods (approximately 87 per year).  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Robin S. Harris (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703 or email to harris.robin@epa.gov.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

1.  Agency/Contracting Activity:

	Department of Veterans Affairs
	Overton Brooks VA Medical Center
	510 East Stoner Avenue
	Shreveport, LA 71111

2.  Description of Action:

This acquisition is to obtain, by the use of other than full and open competition an Intego Pet Infusion System. This equipment increases quality of care to the patient and also to the technologist performing the exam. This system allows accurate, dependable infusion of radiopharmaceutical while significantly reducing the radiation exposure to the patient and technologist. This is helpful because of the difficulty managing radiation exposure in PET imaging, especially that received by the staff.

3.  Description of Services:

    a. To Obtain a Intego PET Infusion System
     b. The estimated cost is $96,160.00

4.  Statutory Authority:

Acquisition by other than full and open competition is provided under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302 (1) (a).

5.  Reason for Authority Cited:

     a. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) when supplies or services required by the agency are available form only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.    

     b. Effort to Obtain Competition - Based on market research MEDRAD Inc. has received FDA clearance to market the MEDRAD Intego PET Infusion System (Intego) for Sodium Fluoride (F18-NaF) administration in PET imaging. F18-NaF PET is most frequently used in oncology to find and assess bone metastases.   With its rapid uptake in the bone and quick bone clearance, there is growing clinical evidence of the value of F18-NaF as a very effective diagnostic imaging agent in bone cancer imaging. PET technology provides high resolution images that may be quantified for detailed and comparative analysis. It is these benefits, in part, that led the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to announce plans in February 2010 to cover F18-NaF PET imaging for beneficiaries under Coverage with Evidence Development program.  Receiving FDA clearance for F18 fluoro-deoxy-glucose (F18-FDG) administration in 2008, Intego is the only multi-PET agent infusion system currently cleared by the FDA. The system is loaded with a multi-dose vial and nuclear medicine technologists can dose on demand from a touchscreen to enable precise, flexible, safe, and efficient administration of PET agents. MEDRAD Intego systems are in place in hospitals and clinics throughout the U.S., Europe, Australia and the Middle East. 

     c. Date of Synopsis -   In accordance with FAR 5.101, Dissemination of Information, the sole source solicitation will be posted in a public place for 3 calendar days based on estimated cost for required services.  

     d. The above acquisition will be negotiated with MEDRAD, INC.

6.  Contracting Officer Determination:

The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the government is fair and reasonable based on price.  

7.  Market Survey:

Based on other companies programs not being compiled in format VA personnel are familiar with and potential cost to the Government to properly train personnel for a different program, requirement to be sole source to MEDRAD, INC.

8. Additional Support for Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

Based on requirement PET imaging utilizes higher energy isotopes that can be challenging to manage from a radiation safety aspect. This infusion system provides an accurate, dependable, and repeatable means of infusing the desired radiopharmaceutical while reducing radiation exposure significantly to technologist performing the exam and moderately to the patient having the test.

9.  Other Interested Sources:

There are no known sources expressing an interest in this acquisition.

10. Action That Will Be Taken To Overcome Barriers to Future Competition:

N/A

During fiscal year 05, NAP (Philadelphia District) entered into contract number W912BU-05-D-0004 with Inglett and Stubbs, International for the installation and expansion of electrical power distribution systems in Afghanistan and Iraq in support of military contingency operations.  The contract was awarded as an IDIQ (indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity) contract with a ceiling of $500 million (base year plus four option years).  This action provides support to military contingencies for various ongoing missions including Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn and various other contingency operations that will still require these services throughout CENTCOM and AFRICOM.  Afghanistan Engineer District (AED) was tasked by USFORA and Multi-National Central Command Iraq (MNC-I) to provide a follow-on contract action for a twelve month base year with four option year periods.  Unfortunately, AED and Gulf Region District (GRD) are unable to accomplish this task due to their present workload and insufficient contracting manpower constraints.  Both AED and Gulf Region District requested that NAP accomplish the follow-on contract action. <BR><BR>The services under this contract include: fixed labor rates for electrical services and materials to support these services, mobilization/demobilization costs, fuel and meetings/conferences.  Many of the military base commands are in need of electricity for critical installation support facilities in support military operations.  <BR><BR>The resulting contract will be a single, firm fixed price, indefinite-delivery type contract.  An award will be made to the offerer that represents the best value to the government.

The technical factors, when combined, are equal.  The technical factors are more important than price.  However, price remains a significant factor.  <BR>Prices will be evaluated utilizing a pricing matrix.  Two sample task orders will be included in the solicitation for evaluation purposes.  One sample task order will represent a conflict environment and the second sample task order will represent a disaster response mission.  All of these task orders are representative of typical situations that a contractor may be called upon to respond under this contract.  <BR>In order to be eligible for award, prices must be submitted on all line items.  Failure to submit a price on all line items may cause rejection of the offer.  The procurement is being conducted as a best value acquisition under Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  <BR>Proposals will be evaluated for completeness in satisfying the requirements of the RFP.  <BR>The applicable NAICS code is 221119 with a size standard of 4 million megawatt hours (a firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours).  The Standard Industrial Code (SIC) is 4911, Electric Services (other electric power generation).<BR>The solicitation will be issued on, or about, 15 April 2010 with proposals due by 14 May 2010.  Solicitation documents will only be available via the web, hard copies will not be available.  Faxed or emailed proposals will not be accepted.<BR>The government will award a contract resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<SUBJECT>Light and Medium-Lift, Fixed-Wing Flight Services Supporting Polar Research
<SOLNBR>DACS10P2189
<RESPDATE>073110
<CONTACT>Pamela Franzel, Contracting Officer, Email pfranzel@nsf.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. There is no solicitation available at this time. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for Market Research purposes only. The National Science Foundation is seeking sources for light and medium-lift, fixed-wing flight services from ski-equipped twin-engine aircraft to support its polar research programs (i.e., the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), and the National Science Foundation's Arctic Program.) The USAP is the national program of scientific research in Antarctica and includes the activities of NSF and other U.S. Government agencies. In the Arctic, NSF is one of many U.S. Government agencies conducting scientific research in that area. NSF-sponsored researchers routinely conduct Arctic research activities in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Russia, and within Scandinavia, often in cooperation with institutions and researchers from those countries and regions.
<p><br />In the Antarctic, operations will be staged primarily from McMurdo Station, Antarctica, employing a "hub-and-spoke" operational plan. It is anticipated the contractor will deploy/redeploy its aircraft annually; however, it is not a government requirement. All coordination (including country clearances and fuel) for deployment to and redeployment from Antarctica will be the responsibility of the contractor. Annual aircraft usage is approximately twelve hundred flight hours over a ninety-four day exclusive use period, generally from early November through early February of the following year. Flights to and from U.S. and other national program bases, field camps, and/or various research stations within Antarctica should be anticipated. Search and Rescue (SAR) missions and remote operations for extended periods from locations other than McMurdo Station are also required. Field operations (900 nm or more) may require aircraft and crew to base out of remote locations (camps) for weeks at a time in adverse weather conditions and at high altitudes. The contractor must be prepared to "camp" as part of a daily routine. The contractor will provide fully contractor operated and maintained flight services consisting of a minimum of two light utility twin engine airplanes and a minimum of two twin engine medium utility airplanes, including full spares package and field equipment (e.g., cargo nets, tie-down straps, tool kit, and survival kit, and other consumables). The Government will supply berthing, meals, fuel, ground power, and certain ground support equipment such as Herman-Nelson style heaters. Contractors are encouraged to supply their own tie-down equipment. The Government has no hangar facilities in Antarctica and aircraft will be exposed to the elements for the duration of their deployment. The government's prime Antarctic support contractor schedules and coordinates daily flight schedules and the aviation services contractor must coordinate closely with the prime contractor on a daily basis in the execution of the flight schedule.</p>
<p>In the Arctic, flight services requirements are intermittent, and may be required at any time of the year. Services are occasionally required in Alaska, but the most concentrated effort is support of ocean sampling sites in a broad region between the Canadian Forces Station Alert and the North Pole. This work occurs for several weeks duration between March and May of each year and involves transportation of science teams and their equipment between sea ice field sites. In Greenland, the work occurs throughout the year but mostly between May and August and involves ferrying field teams to and around the Greenland Ice Cap. The contractor will provide all labor, aircraft and field equipment, materials, fuel, supplies, and consumables. Approximately 150 flight hours annually are anticipated.</p>
<p>As noted, the primary role for both the light and medium utility aircraft in both theaters of operation will be for "utility" transportation services, e.g., ferrying personnel and materials to remote, often unprepared, field locations. However, in the Antarctic, the USAP requires that one or more of the aircraft be configured as &lsquo;science' aircraft, to support various USAP science projects throughout Antarctica. The &lsquo;science' aircraft will likely require outfitting with camera pods, a nadir port, wing hard-points and in-wing cable raceways to allow the aircraft to be used for filming and remote sensing activities to include: aerogeophysical surveys, aerial photography, LIDAR and remote digital mapping, and operation of ice-penetrating radar systems. An additional special requirement will be the ability to fly a towed (cable-deployed) or wing-tip magnetometer for aeromagnetic surveys. Modifications to the contract aircraft are routine so the contractor must have the engineering expertise to provide additional modifications to the aircraft. The installation of any required equipment must be FAA-approved.</p>
<p>The contractor must comply with all laws and regulations, and otherwise have or obtain all needed licenses, permits, and certifications, including those necessary for the carriage of persons or property for hire within the United States, Canada, and Greenland for the duration of the contract. The contractor must hold a current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Carrier Certificate or foreign equivalent. The contractor's Operations Specifications shall authorize operation of the category and class of aircraft, the number of passengers offered, and conditions of flight required by the NSF which include: visual flight rules (VFR day and night), instrument flight rules (IFR), passengers, and cargo. Aircraft must be operated and maintained under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 135 or 121, as appropriate and identified as required by 14 CFR Part 121.135(7) or Part 135.63 or Operations Specifications Part D, "Aircraft Listing," as appropriate. Aircraft must&nbsp;have a Standard Airworthiness Certificate.</p>
<p>Currently the NSF anticipates the following aircraft minimum requirements:<br />Light Utility Aircraft (1 aircraft exclusive use with guaranteed usage - 1 on call aircraft without guaranteed usage)<br />&#61485; Aircraft must be approved for use with AN8, JP8, and JP5 fuel<br />&#61485; Multi-engine, turbine-powered <br />&#61485; Equipped with wheel skis or wheels and/or skis combo<br />&#61485; FAA-approved for flight with door removed<br />&#61485; High wing<br />&#61485; Equipped for flight into Known Ice <br />&#61485; Approved for operations to -54 degrees C <br />&#61485; 150-knot cruise speed at 10,000 feet MSL, ISA with 80% maximum rated power with a cruising endurance of at least four hours.<br />&#61485; Minimum payload of 2,800 pounds with two pilots (360 pounds), and fuel (6.7 pounds per gallon) for 400 nautical miles with 30 minutes reserve. <br />&#61485; Seating for 9 passengers in a standard approved seating configuration<br />&#61485; Maintain positive single engine rate of climb gradient in accordance with the Aircraft Flight manual, at manufacturer's gross takeoff weight (calculated at 5,000' pressure altitude ISA+30) <br />&#61485; Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) capable from ungroomed surfaces. Aircraft shall be able to clear a 50-foot obstacle during takeoff and landing with a runway length of 2000 feet on a standard day at sea level with zero wind at maximum gross certified weight. <br />&#61485; Minimum door size of 62 x 50 inches and must be side facing exit aft of main landing gear or a rear door</p>
<p>Medium Utility Aircraft (1 aircraft exclusive use with guaranteed usage - 1 on call aircraft without guaranteed usage)<br />&#61485; Pressurized cabin or permanently installed oxygen system for flight crew and passengers. <br />&#61485; Capable of operations to -54 degrees C <br />&#61485; Multi Turbine engine powered<br />&#61485; Equipped with wheel skis<br />&#61485; Capable of carrying 19 passengers and have a minimum of 19 quick removal passenger seats<br />&#61485; Equipped with winch for cargo loading and unloading (DC 3T only)<br />&#61485; Cargo door of at least 84 x 56 inches<br />&#61485; Minimum cruise speed of 180 KTS, TAS at 10,000 feet MSL<br />&#61485; Minimum payload of 7,000 pounds with 2.5 hours fuel, plus reserve<br />&#61485; Range of 1,900 nautical miles with 30 minute fuel reserve at optimum altitude and airspeed/power for maximum range at maximum takeoff weight (MTOW), fuel 6.7 pounds/gallon<br />&#61485; Maintain positive single engine rate of climb gradient in accordance with the Aircraft Flight manual, at manufacturer's gross takeoff weight (calculated at 5,000' pressure altitude ISA+30)</p>
<p>The statement of work for fixed-wing aviation services currently under contract is attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the USAP and the respondent's potential ability to meet NSF's requirement. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify interested vendors - large businesses, small businesses, non-profits or other interested parties and to determine if a set-aside is warranted. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 481211 - Nonscheduled Chartered Passenger Air Transportation, which has a small business size standard of 1,500 employees.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">2.0 Introduction to Challenges and Prizes</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Obama Administration recognizes the promise of prizes and challenges to spur innovation, tap the expertise of the American people, and bring the top talent and best ideas to bear on our nation's most pressing problems. In his September 2009 <a href="http://fcw.com/Articles/2010/07/12/FEAT-CTO-job.aspx?Page=3&amp;p=1http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nec/StrategyforAmericanInnovation/"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Strategy for American Innovation</em></a>, the President called on agencies to increase their ability to promote and harness innovation by using tools such as prizes and challenges to solve tough problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In March 2010, the White House Office of Management and Budget issued a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-11.pdf">memorandum</a> to all heads of the Executive Departments and Agencies affirming the Administration's commitment and providing a policy and legal framework to guide agencies in utilizing prizes to stimulate innovation to advance their core mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In April 2010, the White House and the Case Foundation <a href="http://www.casefoundation.org/sites/www.casefoundation.org/files/Promoting%20Innovation_Agenda%204-30.pdf">convened</a> some of the world's top experts in prize competitions to share private sector success stories with nearly 200 policymakers from more than 35 agencies across the Executive Branch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-11.pdf">March 2010 OMB Guidance</a> outlines the nature of the Administration's interest in prizes and challenges. There are four important points for the purposes of this RFI:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Impact</strong>: The Administration is committed to identifying high-impact prizes that best leverage the potential benefits of prizes and challenges, including enabling government to: 1) establish an important goal without having to choose the team or approach that is most likely to succeed, 2) pay only for results, 3) increase the number and diversity of the individuals, organization, and teams that are addressing a particular problem or challenge, 4) stimulate private sector investment that is many times greater than the cash value of the prize, and 5) capture the public imagination and change the public's and the government's perception of what is possible.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Types: </strong>The Administration is interested in the full spectrum of prize types from "point solution prizes" that reward and spur development for solutions to a well defined problem; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>to "exposition prizes" that identify promising ideas and practices that may not otherwise get attention; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>to "participation prizes" that motivate behavior change and skill development by the contestants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Federal agencies are exploring challenges and prizes that will result in promising ideas and practices, product innovations or improvements, process improvements, increased awareness and participation, and new or strengthened networks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></p>

Therefore, agencies are encouraged to explore prizes and challenges as tools to spur innovations large (e.g. <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ipp/innovation_incubator/centennial_challenges/index.html">NASA Centennial Challenges</a>, <a href="http://www.lightingprize.org/">Energy's L Prize to Change the Lighting Landscape</a>) and small (e.g. <a href="http://www.appsforhealthykids.com/">Apps for Health Kids</a>, <a href="http://fcw.com/Articles/2010/07/12/FEAT-CTO-job.aspx?Page=3&amp;p=1">Department of Labor Career Videos Challenge</a>).<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></p>

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Request for Information: Products and Services for Challenges and Prizes</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong>1.0 Background <br />The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has been directed to provide access to qualified contractors who can assist federal government agencies in identifying, designing, and implementing challenges and prizes to promote open government, innovation, and other national priorities.</p>
<p>On March 8, 2010 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES M-10-11Guidance on the Use of Challenges and Prizes to Promote Open Government, which affirms the Obama Administration's commitment to expand agencies' use of prizes and challenges and provides agencies with a preliminary policy and legal framework for doing so. <br />Among other things, the OMB memorandum states:<br />Additionally, the General Services Administration (GSA) will develop, as expeditiously as possible, a contract vehicle to provide agency access to relevant products and services, including technical assistance in structuring and conducting contests to take maximum benefit of the marketplace as they identify and pursue contest initiatives to further the policy objectives of the Federal Government.</p>
<p>As the ecosystem of vendors that provide products and services for challenges and prizes is relatively new and quickly changing, GSA has determined that a Request for Information (RFI) is needed to supplement its extensive market research, seek feedback on planned acquisition approaches, and announce an Industry Day.</p>
<p>GSA's planned acquisition approach at this time is to:<br />&bull;Identify vendors already on GSA schedule who have past experience providing the capabilities needed for agencies to identify, design, and run challenges and prizes;<br />&bull;Assist vendors with challenge and prize experience who are not yet on GSA schedule with information on how to get on GSA schedule;<br />&bull;Encourage teaming and subcontracting between GSA Schedule contractors without complete capabilities and vendors with challenge expertise and capabilities who are not yet on GSA schedule; and<br />&bull;Determine the potential for future multiple award contracts or other acquisition strategies.</p>
<p>2.0 Introduction to Challenges and Prizes</p>
<p>The Obama Administration recognizes the promise of prizes and challenges to spur innovation, tap the expertise of the American people, and bring the top talent and best ideas to bear on our nation's most pressing problems. In his September 2009 Strategy for American Innovation, the President called on agencies to increase their ability to promote and harness innovation by using tools such as prizes and challenges to solve tough problems. In March 2010, the White House Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum to all heads of the Executive Departments and Agencies affirming the Administration's commitment and providing a policy and legal framework to guide agencies in utilizing prizes to stimulate innovation to advance their core mission. In April 2010, the White House and the Case Foundation convened some of the world's top experts in prize competitions to share private sector success stories with nearly 200 policymakers from more than 35 agencies across the Executive Branch.</p>
<p>The March 2010 OMB Guidance outlines the nature of the Administration's interest in prizes and challenges. There are four important points for the purposes of this RFI:</p>
<p>&bull;Impact: The Administration is committed to identifying high-impact prizes that best leverage the potential benefits of prizes and challenges, including enabling government to: 1) establish an important goal without having to choose the team or approach that is most likely to succeed, 2) pay only for results, 3) increase the number and diversity of the individuals, organization, and teams that are addressing a particular problem or challenge, 4) stimulate private sector investment that is many times greater than the cash value of the prize, and 5) capture the public imagination and change the public's and the government's perception of what is possible.</p>
<p>&bull;Types: The Administration is interested in the full spectrum of prize types from "point solution prizes" that reward and spur development for solutions to a well defined problem; to "exposition prizes" that identify promising ideas and practices that may not otherwise get attention; to "participation prizes" that motivate behavior change and skill development by the contestants. Federal agencies are exploring challenges and prizes that will result in promising ideas and practices, product innovations or improvements, process improvements, increased awareness and participation, and new or strengthened networks.</p>
<p>&bull;Policy Areas: The Administration sees potential to reap the benefits of prizes in a broad set of policy areas, from space exploration, science, and technology to education, workforce development, and nutrition. Every federal agency has been encouraged to consider the role of prizes and challenges to drive innovation and their core mission.</p>
<p>&bull;Size of Prize: The Administration believes high-impact challenges need not feature a high dollar prize purse. Therefore, agencies are encouraged to explore prizes and challenges as tools to spur innovations large (e.g. NASA Centennial Challenges, Energy's L Prize to Change the Lighting Landscape) and small (e.g. Apps for Health Kids, Department of Labor Career Videos Challenge).</p>
<p>3.0 Government Requirements<br />As federal agencies increasingly use challenges and prizes, they will require streamlined access to a new set of products and professional service solutions.</p>
<p>A.Products <br />Through a previous competitive process, GSA provides a challenge platform to federal agencies at Challenge.gov, which agencies can use to create new challenges and showcase challenges from any platform.</p>
<p>To implement prizes and challenges, agencies may require additional technology products such as 1) web-based challenge platforms that meet the needs of specific challenge types or targeted solver communities, or 2) bug/defect fixes and updates/upgrades in function and technology to maintain the operability and usability of the software products and technology platform.</p>
<p>Web-based challenge platforms may require some or all, but not limited to, the following characteristics:</p>
<p>Basics<br />&bull;Be provided as Software as a Service (SaaS) or hosted by an agency behind their firewall;</p>
<p>&bull;May require supplemental professional services as discussed in Section B below;</p>
<p>&bull;Include an established solver community or functionality to form a community around the challenge;</p>
<p>&bull;Support multiple and concurrent challenges;</p>
<p>&bull;Comply with federal legal and regulatory software/hardware requirements, including Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (accessibility requirements), privacy and security regulations and policy.</p>
<p>User-Friendly &amp; Flexible to Accommodate Distinct Prize Designs</p>
<p>&bull;Make it easy for government to clearly communicate the problem to be solved, the type of solutions sought, and the rules of the prize or challenge;</p>
<p>&bull;Enable government to post monetary, non-monetary, or no-prize challenges;</p>
<p>&bull;Make the type and size of prize immediately visible to potential solvers;</p>
<p>&bull;Make it easy for users to submit solutions to a government-sponsored prize or challenge.</p>
<p>&bull;Enable users to submit a range of solution types (e.g. idea, video, proof of concept, prototype) and include the following types of media in their submission: links, images, photos, videos, software applications, and other attachments;</p>
<p>&bull;Make it easy for a private group of judges to confidentially review, rate &amp; rank submissions in a systematic work flow;<br />&bull;Make it easy to display and communicate winning solutions.</p>
<p>Transparent &amp; Collaborative</p>
<p>&bull;Enable the broader public to browse the prizes, challenges, innovative solutions, discussions, and winners without registration; <br />&bull;Enable users to see, discuss, refine, and evaluate solutions proposed by others;<br />&bull;Enable users to vote or rate others' submissions;<br />&bull;Include a gaming/market environment which allows participants to "invest" in submitted idea, win points and rewards for the participation, or other forms of incentives to participate;<br />&bull;Enable users to share challenges and proposed solutions via email, social networks, RSS, APIs, etc.;<br />&bull;Enable users to form teams; <br />&bull;Enable users to establish a visible reputation by using the site, which can then be used to weight feedback and comments;<br />&bull;Enable administrator to turn/off any of the transparency and collaboration features.<br />Analytics<br />&bull;Detailed analytics of the ongoing engagement (e.g. number of participants, number of submissions or entries, votes and comments).<br />B.Professional Services<br />In order to maximize the benefits of prizes and challenges, agencies may require technical assistance from experienced individuals or companies to identify, design, or conduct challenges and prize competitions. Services may be provided separately or packaged with a technology product to provide a single overall solution.</p>
<p>Agencies may require some or all, but not limited to, the following services:</p>
<p>Portfolio Mapping &amp; Prize Identification</p>
<p>&bull;Work with agency leadership to map policy priorities and identify the problems, questions, and needs that can best be solved through prizes and challenges; <br />&bull;Translate agency priorities into a set of actionable prize concepts.<br />Challenge and Prize Design<br />&bull;Strategic concept development; <br />&bull;Identify the right prize archetype for the stated goal; <br />&bull;Market research, interviews, and stakeholder engagement to understand how best to structure the prize given 1) existing activity in the space, 2) number and kind of potential participants, and 3) primary motivations of contestants;<br />&bull;Craft the problem statement and call to action; <br />&bull;Recommend length of prize competition, type and size of prize purse, eligibility, submission rules, and other incentives; <br />&bull;Provide legal guidance on rules, such as intellectual property recommendations<br />&bull;Establish judging criteria;<br />&bull;Suggest judges and advise on public versus expert judging;<br />&bull;Recommend the technology platform/solver-community given the type of challenge.<br />Prize Implementation &amp; Administration<br />&bull;Develop work plan and timeline for the prize or challenge administration;<br />&bull;Ensure compliance with federal legal and regulatory software/hardware requirements, including Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (accessibility requirements), privacy and security regulations and policy;<br />&bull;Build, motivate, and nurture a problem solver community; <br />&bull;Conduct outreach and marketing campaigns to engage the public and commercial marketplace; <br />&bull;Moderate or advise on moderation; <br />&bull;Answer questions from potential entrants; <br />&bull;Review submissions for security and/or eligibility; <br />&bull;Provide analytics and metrics on the prize or challenge; <br />&bull;Evaluation and report on the challenge; <br />&bull;Plan and execute event to celebrate the winners; <br />&bull;Other aspects of daily program management and administration;<br />&bull;Ability to support multiple and concurrent challenges, including multiple concurrent challenges by a single agency or group of agencies.</p>
<p>4.0. Request for Information</p>
<p>In addition to the current planned acquisition strategy, GSA is looking at the potential to provide future services via the Multiple Award Schedule program or other acquisition alternatives, and is seeking information from industry partners that currently hold a Schedule 70 or Schedule 541 contract, or are interested in providing such services and/or products by becoming a Schedule 70 or Schedule 541 contractor (directly or through teaming).</p>
<p>All responses to this RFI are due not later than August 6, 2010 to Ms. Carmen Calloway. Please send your responses to Ms. Calloway at Carmen.Calloway@gsa.gov with the subject as challenges and prizes.</p>

<DESC><p>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</p>
<p>OVERVIEW:</p>
<p>The Department of State is conducting market research to determine the degree of interest and capability of American small businesses only in providing local guard services and surveillance detection services at the U.S. Consulates in Calgary, Winnipeg and Quebec City, Canada. The Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security plays an essential role in ensuring that foreign policy missions are accomplished in a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the local guard services is to provide protection for US personnel, facilities and equipment from damage or loss due to violent attack and theft. The local guards act as an early warning signal to the American Consulate and the RSO. The contractor shall be required to control access to the facilities; protect human life; maintain order, and resist criminal attacks against mission personnel, visitors, and family dependents. The Contractor shall be responsible for responding to intruder alerts by notifying the RSO and following the procedures identified in the General Post Orders and individual Post Orders. The Contractor shall maintain a sufficient number of trained and qualified personnel in order to meet the required hours of operation for each post listed on Exhibit A (Guard Posts and Schedule of Guard Coverage)</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to provide Standard as well as Additional or Emergency (A&amp;E) guard services. The need for A&amp;E services may stem from such things as a Very Important Person (VIP) visitor to the Consulate, information indicating a possible terrorist attack, or change in threat environment. These changes form the basis for on-going analysis and review of the structure and location of posts as well as the level of security in effect.</p>
<p>At the present time, The Department of State plans on awarding three (3) separate contracts; however, it reserves the right to combine the requirements for one or more locations into one or more contracts.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to perform routine guard services (i.e., control access to facilities, protect human life, maintain order and resist criminal attacks against mission personnel, visitors, and family dependents) as well as Surveillance Detection Operations.</p>
<p>Surveillance Detection Operations are discreet and are not to be considered as a replacement for the on going efforts by others such as members of the Local Guard Force; Surveillance detection operations are intended to be an early warning mechanism to detect rather than protect. Since coordination and cooperation with host country police and/or security forces will be required, it will be essential for the Contractor to recognize any political sensitivity that may arise in the performance of these operations</p>
<p>No guard or surveillance detection specialist will be approved to work until he/she has completed all training required by the contract. Therefore, the contractor must have or have the ability to provide the training required by the contract. The basic training program for guards shall be a minimum of eighty (80) hours. The US Government will provide the initial Surveillance Detection (SD) Training to SD personnel. Thereafter, the Contractor is responsible for providing initial training to new employees as well as conducting SD annual refresher training.</p>
<p>PLANNED ACQUISITION:</p>
<p>The Government will solicit this requirement using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this procurement is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services, and the small business size standard is $18,500,000 in average annual receipts. The Government plans to award one or multiple contracts for these services. The anticipated period of performance is a base year consisting of 12 months of full performance and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. The Contractor will be required to provide all necessary equipment and supplies (i.e., uniforms, radios, vehicles, cell phones, desks, file cabinets, computer(s), printer(s), digitial cameras, binoculars, log books, file folders, administrative supplies) as identified in the request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>Unlike some guard service contracts, the Department of State does not allow subcontracting of either Standard or Additional or Emergency Services. However, a contractor can subcontract support services such as maintenance of equipment.</p>
<p>All Contractor personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor including checks of employment history, criminal record, residence, and credit. Furthermore, each employee must be formally nominated and approved by the U.S. Government in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract before they can begin work under the contract.</p>
<p>The estimated number of annual hours of Local Guard Services and Surveillance Detection (SD) operations to be conducted at each Consulate is listed below:</p>
<p>Labor Category&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quebec City&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calgary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winnipeg</span><br /></strong>Guard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14,568&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,928&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,960<br />Senior Guard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,944&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,952&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NA<br />SD Specialist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8,760&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5,952&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NA<br />SD Supervisor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,944&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1,952&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; NA<br />Totals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27,216&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12,784&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1,960</p>

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION ON GUARD SOLICITATIONS AND CONTRACTS:</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in providing Local Guard Services to the U.S. Department of State. The below information is provided about the local guard contracts for your reference. Please contact the Contract Specialist (stated above in the Sources Sought Notice) with any questions about the local guard program.</p>
<p>All local guard solicitations are posted on FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov). You are encouraged to review other recently posted local guard solicitations to familiarize yourself with the contract format, terms, and conditions. Some recently posted solicitations are:</p>
<p>&bull;SAQMMA09R0282, Kampala, Uganda <br />&bull;SAQMMA10R0221, Luxembourg, Luxembourg <br />&bull;SAQMMA09R0280; Paris, France</p>
<p>The following sections of the solicitation are particularly important for familiarization:<br />o Section C - Performance Work Statement (provides purpose, objectives, mission, specific tasks)<br />o Section H - Special Contract Requirements (includes approval and acceptance of Contractor Employees, training requirements, key personnel requirements, licensing and insurance requirements)<br />o Exhibit A - Guard Posts and Schedule of Guard Coverage (provides number of guards and schedule required by contract, as well as labor category designation)<br />o Exhibit C - Quality Assurance and Surveillance Plan (shows how Government will monitor Contractor performance and how deductions are taken for unacceptable performance)<br />o Exhibit D - Contractor Furnished Property (displays list of property to be furnished by Contractor)</p>
<p>STANDARD ACQUISITION TIME LINE:</p>
<p>The Government plans to issue a solicitation for this requirement within the next 90 days, and the solicitation will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (i.e., https://www.fbo.gov). No paper copies of the solicitation will be mailed to prospective offerors, and all announcements and amendments made to this solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>The synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days. Then the solicitation will be posted and the Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period begins. The solicitation will be open for sixty (60) days and proposals must be received by close of the sixty (60) day submission period with award to be made approximately forty-five (45) to sixty (60) days after proposal submission. All dates are subject to change.<br /><br />A site visit at the U.S. Consulates are tentatively scheduled to take place approximately thirty (30) days after the solicitation opens and a firm date will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted. Offerors are responsible for all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations. Due to space limitations, only two representatives from each firm will be allowed to attend the site visit.</p>
<p>CONTRACT TYPE AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION: <br /><br />Type of Contract:</p>
<p>The type of contract will be a Time-and-Materials (T&amp;M) contract as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.601. The contract will also include firm-fixed price and cost-reimbursement components.</p>
<p>Hourly Rates:</p>
<p>Fixed Hourly Rates - The fixed hourly rates for Standard Services as well as Additional or Emergency Services are fully burdened rates and shall include all wages (local labor law compliance if applicable and any premiums relating to overtime, holidays, or night shifts), overhead, fringe benefits, severance costs, general and administrative expenses and profit for each category of labor.</p>
<p>Since the prices are fixed at the time of award for the period of the contract (i.e., base year plus option periods), they will only be adjusted in accordance with DOSAR 652.216-71 Price Adjustment (AUG 1999) which states the following:</p>
<p>The contract price may be increased or decreased in actual costs of direct service labor. The changes result from laws enacted and effective during the term of this contract by the host Government. Direct service labor costs include only the costs of wages and direct benefits (such as social security, health insurance, unemployment compensation insurance) paid to or incurred for the direct benefit of personnel performing services under one of the categories listed in Section B (Supplies or Services and Prices) of the contract. Price adjustments will include only changes in direct service labor costs incurred in order to comply with the requirements of law. No adjustment will be made under this clause with respect to labor costs of personnel not performing direct service labor under the categories of Section B, or for overhead, profit, general and administrative (G&amp;A) costs, taxes or any other costs whatsoever.</p>
<p>Payment Information:</p>
<p>Offers and payment may be in U.S. dollars. A United States (U.S.) corporation desiring to be paid in U.S. dollars should submit their offer in U.S. dollars. A U.S. corporation should not to be confused with the definition of a U.S. person for the purpose of applying U.S. preference in the proposal evaluation.</p>
<p>Information about 22USC4864(c) (3) as it pertains to the award of local guard contracts:</p>
<p>In accordance with 22USC4864(c)(3), the State Department is required to award guard service contracts to the technically acceptable firm offering the lowest evaluated price, except that proposals of United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons (as defined in subsection (d) of this section) shall be evaluated by reducing the bid price by 10 percent.</p>
<p>Section 136 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, Public Law 101-246 (22 U.S.C. 4864), as amended, provides that a "United States person" or a "qualified United States joint venture" must meet certain requirements, listed in the Act, to be eligible for the statutory preference.</p>
<p>Therefore, any solicitation released for guard services is subject to Section 136 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (22 U.S.C. 4864). Each solicitation and contract for guard services includes DOSAR 652.237-73 Statement of Qualifications For Preference As A U.S. Person (APR 2004) as well as a requirement for the Contractor to complete a certification (Statement Of Qualifications For Purposes Of Obtaining Preference As A U.S. Person (22 U.S.C. 4864) if the Contractor is requesting eligibility for the statutory preference. (See Attachment)</p>
<p>TRANSITION PLAN AND PHASED TAKEOVER:</p>
<p>A timely and smooth transition is of the utmost importance to the Government.</p>
<p>A Preliminary Transition Plan is requested as part of any proposal and is approved at the time of award. A Final Transition Plan is required within ten (10) days of contract award. The transition period shall not exceed ninety (90) calendar days and full performance shall commence at the date specified in the Notice-to-Proceed (NTP) issued by the Contracting Officer (CO).</p>
<p>The NTP can only be issued after the contractor provides the U.S. Government the deliverables required by the contract such as the following: draft incident report, copy of all licenses and permits, and copy of applicable insurance policies.</p>
<p>An incoming Contractor assumes full responsibility for an orderly phase-in of operations that minimize the impact to the Embassy. Outgoing Contractors develop a Phase-Out Plan for the orderly transition of the operations. The transition procedures shall not disrupt or adversely affect the day-to-day operations of the Consulate and shall result in a smooth and orderly transfer of responsibility to the successor.</p>
<p>The Government prefers that the Contractor begin full performance of the contract requirements on a specific changeover date. Failure of the Contractor to complete transition either within ninety (90) days after contract award or by the start date stated in the Notice-to-Proceed, whichever is later, may be grounds for termination of the contract for default. <br />HOW PROPOSALS WILL BE EVALUATED IF REQUESTED:<br />General Information:</p>
<p>Each proposal must meet all the requirements stated in the solicitation and be prepared in accordance with Section L (Instructions, Conditions and Notices To Offerors). The Government will evaluate acceptable proposals as described in Section M and the Offeror's responsibility in accordance with FAR Part 9. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the technical requirements, (i.e., Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA)).</p>
<p>In order to be considered acceptable and receive a "pass", the Offeror's Technical Proposal must demonstrate the ability to perform the prospective contract successfully. The Government will consider the factors and sub-factors, described in the solicitation in determining acceptability.</p>
<p>The evaluation of each factor and sub-factor will consider completeness and clarity, degree of compliance with the solicitation, and the likelihood that the approach will be successful as proposed. The Government is seeking to determine if the Offeror demonstrates a thorough understanding of the scope and complexity of the work and recognizes the need to protect government property, employees, and the visitors.</p>
<p>The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.<br />Rejection of Offers:<br />The Government reserves the right to reject an offer if one of the following conditions exists:</p>
<p>&bull;Offer fails to submit any of the required proposal documents as required by Section L;<br />&bull;Offer submits a cost/price proposal that cannot be adequately explained or substantiated; and<br />&bull;Offer submits an offer that could not be made technically acceptable without a major re-write.<br />Overall Evaluation:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate proposals in three phases:</p>
<p>1. Review of the proposal to determine whether it is timely and complies with the instructions in Section L (Instructions, Conditions and Notices To Offerors);<br />2. Technical evaluation to determine the technical acceptability of the offer to the solicitation's technical requirements; and<br />3. A price evaluation to determine the total price proposed by each Offeror, including any applicable U.S. preference.</p>

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Central Energy Resources Science Center, Denver, CO has a need to develop methods to document and report on the release of methane in the Arctic Ocean coastal environments.
This requirement is intended to understand the role that methane gas as released from the Arctic shelf may have on atmospheric chemistry and potentially climate change.  The specific outcome of this effort will be the development of improved remotely operated vehicle (ROV) techniques for surveying underwater gas release on the transgressed shelf of the Beaufort Sea.  A remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) as supplied by the awarded vendor shall be deployed as part of a planned Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) led expedition to the southern Beaufort Sea in the vicinity of the Mackenzie Delta where sea bed gas release has been observed in various geologic environments.  The awarded vendor shall lead the ROV component of the research activities in close association with thee collaborators (1) the Geological Survey of Canada, (2) Fisheries and Oceans Canada and (3) the Canadian Coast Guard Service.  The goal of the awarded vendor's ROV dives shall be to characterize the nature of gas release at the seabed and to improve methods and practices for simple ROV operations.  The awarded vendor's required Phantom ROV is a small special built ROV that can be relatively easily used in and Arctic setting.  The goals of this research are to evaluate if this type of equipment can be used to characterize seabed gas releases and eventually used to survey the Beaufort Sea shelf off the northern coast of Alaska.
The research expedition under the direction of (1) the Geological Survey of Canada, (2) Fisheries and Oceans Canada, (3) Canadian Coast Guard Service, and the (4) MBARI (or the awarded vendor) shall visit two areas where sonar data have allowed identification of possible gas plumes emanating from the sea bed.  These include gas plumes and surface water gas release in the mid shelf environment (water depths 40-60m) typified by the Kopanoar pingo like feature described by Paull et al., (2007) and gas releases at the shelf edge/shelf break environment  (80-120 m water depth) described by Hughes-Clarke et al., (2009).  Similar features may exist on the Alaskan shelf, but because of the lack of focused research expeditions and survey data their potential occurrence are uncertain.
The ROV as supplied by the awarded vendor shall be equipped with high resolution underwater cameras, imaging sonar, and a new water column gas sampling apparatus as provided by MBARI.  The project collaborators, which include the (1) Geological Survey of Canada, (2) Fisheries and Oceans Canada, (3) Canadian Coast Guard Service, and the (4) MBARI (or the awarded vendor) shall undertake ROV surveys where gas plumes have been previously identified.  The focus of this effort shall be to evaluate and use visible and imaging ROV sonar techniques to trace the acoustically defined gas plumes to their sea bed source.  Once the sea bed source is identified the research collaborators lead by the awarded vendor shall use the capabilities of the small ROV to appraise the character of gas release (bubble size and frequency of emissions), the detailed morphologies related to gas release sites (for instance is the gas being released from orifices or cracks in the sea bed?) and the possible occurrence of unique biologic communities related to gas release and the broad regional character of the sea bed where past gas release may have occurred.
Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Moss Landing, CA 95039-9644, and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required products/services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business, July 30, 2010 by 3:00 PM Mountain Standard Time.

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers; Detroit District intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to the Oceanweather, Inc.. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>Assistance on creation of a long term-wind and pressure field climatology for the entire Great Lake region has been requested to develop new inundation flood maps water level maps for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  Extreme storm waves and surge heights are used for the flood maps.  Providing quality surge and wave estimates in the Great Lakes are dictated by the quality of the forcing functions, namely the winds and pressure fields.  Describing the fast moving meteorological events can be accomplished by many methods.  One method used for the past decade is the Natural Neighbor Method (NN, D. Beletsky, et al.  2003), spatially interpolating point-source meteorological information (e.g. wind speed, direction, and barometric pressure) producing time varying spatial fields.  This method has been used for a series of pilot studies in Lake Michigan involving validation of wave and surge modeling technologies.  Results from these tests indicated certain northerly and southerly wind events extending along the central axis of Lake Michigan did not produce an expected spatial coherency in the wind fields.  The consequences of this deficiency produced a persistent negative bias in the wave and surge model estimates compared to the measurements.  Very recently, a new set of high-resolution meteorological products have been produced.  The CFSR archive is based on a re-analysis program of all meteorological products generated by NOAAs National Center for Environmental Predictions.  This 31-year archive (1979 to 2009) provides wind and barometric fields on a 0.5-deg global geographical resolution at a one-hour interval.  This archive only became available in early 2010, and was not originally considered as a source to be used for the pilot studies.  Based on the shortcoming in the NN winds and pressures (i.e., lacking spatial coherency along the central axis of Lake Michigan), the CFSR products were created for a handful of storms in the pilot studies. The CFSR archive was accessed by ERDC CHL staff, the files downloaded, translated from a GRid In Binary (GRIB), and interpolated on the wave model grid.  The time required to perform these tasks was significant.  Modeling studies conducted to date indicate significant advantages to using the CFSR wind product, and this wind information is needed to maximize the accuracy and quality of modeling studies being done in support of FEMA for all the Great Lakes.<BR><BR>Work will be conducted to down-load, translate, and interpolate wind and pressure fields for the entire CFSR archive data set.  The interpolation method used would be a bi-linear interpolation.  The target domain will encompass all of the Great Lakes including Lake St. Clair and will be bounded by the following longitude and latitudes:<BR><BR>				LATITUDE:  41.0-deg N to 50.0-deg N<BR>				LONGUDE:  93.5-deg W to 75.5-deg W<BR><BR>The grid resolution should be no greater than 0.02-deg for longitude and latitude.  Hourly wind (u and v components), and barometric pressure fields will be generated.  Nominal testing of quality in the CFSR fields should be pursued, only to assure time consistency and checks for any discontinuities in the data stream<BR><BR>The Government intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract on a sole source basis. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities to perform the requirements in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 14:00 hrs Eastern Time Zone on 21 July 2010. Your response must demonstrate your firms capabilities, and experience. These will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort with full and open competition, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the government to: LRE-Quotes@usace.army.mil with W911XK-10-T-0096 referenced in the subject line.<BR> <BR>The estimated dollar value of this procurement is between $10,000 and 20,000<BR>

The Safe Patient Handling Business Case will: 1) Create a comprehensive, transparent, robust and defensible understanding of the total costs and benefits of an SPH program at the VA; 2) Identify possible alternative means, methods, or levels for implementing an SPH and create understanding of the relative advantages and disadvantages of each using a decision analysis methodology; 3) For the best implementation alternative, create new options to increase the value created by the program; 4) For the final plan with value-increasing options, create an "investment grade" business case of the costs and benefits to support the decision-making and approval processes and subsequent implementation. "Investment grade" means a business case supplying the substantiation, numerical projections, and rationale necessary for the applicable decision-making processes.

The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, and size standard is $7 million.

<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Contracting Officer, Email christopher.glista@darpa.mil - Paul Eremenko, Program Manager, Email paul.eremenko@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Tactical Technology Office (TTO), intends to award a sole-source contract to Local Motors, Inc. (LMI), of Chandler, Arizona for a Vehicle Crowd-Sourcing Challenge effort. LMI is a developer and supplier of crowd-sourced custom vehicles that employs a vast social network and collaboration tools to compete, judge, and develop novel vehicle concepts which are subsequently manufactured by a supplier network and assembled in LMI's micro-factories. The Vehicle Crowd-Sourcing Challenge will leverage LMI's existing infrastructure to crowd-source the design, manufacturing, and assembly of a militarily-relevant body for an existing off-road vehicle chassis and powertrain design. This is intended to serve as a pilot and proof-of-concept activity for future DARPA vehicle crowd-sourcing efforts which the Government intends to solicit competitively.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." As the developer, owner, and operator of a large, existing crowd-sourcing social network; a crowd-sourcing collaboration environment for vehicle design; an infrastructure for advertising, promulgating, conducting, and judging challenge-style competitive developments; a rapidly responsive custom supplier network; and an appropriate micro-factory manufacturing facility, LMI possesses unique knowledge, capabilities, and  intellectual property necessary to carry out the required effort. No other source would be capable of satisfying the requirements for an affordable and complete end-to-end solution within the aggressive timeframe necessary to meet the Government's needs. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.<br /> Responses/proposals received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting a white paper and past performance data by no later than 12:00 PM (noon), August 30, 2010 to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr. Christopher Glista, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 or via email to christopher.glista@darpa.mil. Questions shall be submitted to the above email address. Please refer to Special Notice 10-61.<br />It is noted that DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO) maintains an annual office-wide Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeking system and subsystem level technologies that enable revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military. Parties wishing to respond to this notice are invited, as an alternative, to submit a white paper against DARPA-BAA-10-09 "Innovative Systems for Military Missions."<br />

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), to negotiate/award a purchase order to Atempo Americas, 2465 E Bayshore Rd. Suite 400, Palo Alto, CA 94303-3228 for the purchase and maintenance of Tempo Live backup for Windows and MAC.
 NHGRI has deployed a wide-range of servers and desktops, including these MAC servers, laptops, and desktops. The MAC platform is running proprietary software that cannot be easily ported to other platforms, and are necessary to support the goals of the institute.  To ensure the continued success of NHGRI, it is necessary to purchase the additional drives to expand the capabilities of our backups for our MAC platform.

This renewal is necessary to provide and protect the data files on NHGRIs  Macintosh platform and scientific workstations.  This service will also allow staff members to contact the manufacturer with technical issues and ensure that NHGRI has access to latest technology to protect the network environment from vulnerabilities.  

Atempo is currently providing licensing and maintenance service to NHGRI. Remaining with this vendor would maintain the continuity of ongoing research being conducted in various studies. Changing vendors at this time would jeopardize the investments already made by the Government

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 511210 and the Size Standard is $25 Million. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6151, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee, by fax transmission to (301)480-3345 or by email to ferebeers@nhlbi.nih.gov

This action is under the authority of 41.U.S.C.253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 13.106(b)(2), and HHSAR 306-302-1. Interested parties responding to this announcement need to do so by 9:00am Eastern Standard Time on July 21, 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERY PWR ARRA MORA PMIS 72360 For Information Only - Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Modification to 8a Contract,  MORA Sunrise Visitor Center, Renovation of Flooring, Doors, Cabinets, and Millwork.
RECOVERY TAS::14 1035::TAS RECOVERY MORA PMIS 72360 The National Park Service intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract modification in the amount of $27,135 to Saybr Contractors, Inc., 3852 South 66th Street, Tacoma, Washington 98409 for additional construction and renovation at the Sunrise Visitor Center, Mount Rainier National Park. This is not a request for competitive proposals and is published for the purpose of providing public notification. 
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS SOLE SOURCE ACTION
1. Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity: Department of Interior, National Park Service, Pacific West Region, Mount Rainier National Park, action awarded through North Cascades National Park, Sedro-Woolley, WA 98284.
2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: The National Park Service, North Cascades National Park, intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract modification for additional construction and renovation work as identified in this announcement in accordance with FAR Part 6, FAR Part 43, and FAR 19.8 and 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (5) to Saybr Contractors of Tacoma, Washington. 
3. A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value: Modification, additional within scope work at Mount Rainier National Park, Sunrise Visitor Center; added work includes removing existing displays, remove and replace additional flooring, additional casework per revised drawings, add new door sidelights to match existing for historical accuracy, various deducts based on site visit. Net increase $27,135 

4. An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: FAR Part 6, and FAR 19.8 and 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (5). 
5. A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: Saybr Contractors was recently awarded a contract to perform work at Mount Rainier NP, Sunrise VC. The added work is a result of revised drawings and specifications, and a site visit that was not possible at time of initial negotiation and award. Saybr was initially selected based on the following: Saybr Contractors is a Small Business Administration certified small and disadvantaged business with extensive construction experience at Mount Rainier. Saybr has performed numerous projects at Mount Rainier National Park, all have been satisfactory.  The Sunrise Visitor Center is located at 6400 feet and no access to the jobsite is available this time of year without the use of helicopters and/or snowmobiles, the area is prone to snowstorms, blizzard conditions, and avalanche risk. Due to the aforementioned factors, conducting any form of group site visit is impractical and could be dangerous. Normal road access to Sunrise VC, for the purpose of a competitive site visit, is not anticipated until June, this would not allow sufficient time to solicit and award a contract for performance this year.  This would also delay the opening of the exhibits.  Additionally, this would not allow expenditure of the ARRA funded money within the timeframe designated for expenditure of funds (all requirements of law are being met and this action is in full compliance with acquisition regulations). Saybr has direct experience at Mount Rainier, direct experience working in remote locations, and direct experience in forecasting the costs related to performing the work at Mount Rainier.

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies: Soliciting a single offer from a SBA certified small disadvantaged business is authorized through the SBA 8a Program at this dollar threshold. This ARRA funded modification is synopsized to promote maximum transparency of expenditure of ARRA funds.
7. A Determination by the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable: NPS utilizes Architects and Engineers to review the proposed modification to insure fair and reasonable pricing.
8. A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research was conducted by the Contracting Officer at North Cascades National Park and by the Program Personnel at MORA to verify the aforementioned factors are accurate. 
9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples): N/A
10. A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A
11. A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required: Award of this action is in accordance with all laws and within all guidelines of Federal Acquisition Regulations and based upon the aforementioned factors is in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for the installation of ABB UNITROL Static Excitation Systems for Mobile District Projects Allatoona Lake, GA and West Point Dam and lake, GA and AL.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, ABB Inc., 10300 Boul Henri-Bourassa O, Saint-Laurent Canada, H4S IN6, under authority of FAR 6.302.  At the time of procurement for the Static Excitation Systems, it was the Governments intent to perform the installation, but the current workload at both powerhouses is preventing this work from taking place.  Had the current circumstances been anticipated at the time of procurement, the installation would have been included in the supply contract awarded to ABB.  ABB is the product manufacturer; therefore, technical problems will be minimized on the installation and the warranty will not be compromised.  Moreover, under the current contract for the equipment, ABB is required to conduct the commissioning and training for the systems.  Therefore, it is determined to be in the Governments best interest to have ABB install the systems.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract will be awarded. The (NAICS) code is 811310 and the number dollar amount is $7.0M. <BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within fifteen calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: U.S. Army Engineer District, Mobile, P.O.

<p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)).<br />USDA, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE, Midwest Area, Procurement &amp; Property Section.<br />2. Nature/Description of Actions(s) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)). <br />a. This action is for an AgLeader Yield Monitoring System required to be on a used combine per solicitation # AG-64PP-S-10-BB04. <br />3. Description of Supplies/Services (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)). <br />AgLeader Yield Monitoring System <br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)(c)).<br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1. The equipment required by the agency is the only one available that will satisfy the Agency requirements. <br />5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique qualifications (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)).<br />a. Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2))<br />(1) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)) states,<br />"When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."<br />(2) The requirement is for an AgLeader Yield Monitoring System to be installed on a used combine as part of the purchase price. The Research Unit is requiring the AgLeader brand because this brand is already installed on an existing combine as well as a cotton picker. This allows the Research Unit to be able to move the existing Insight color display from one to the other without having to purchase additional color displays. This also allows for consistent research data without the need to interpret data from various systems. <br />6. Federal Business Opportunities - FedBizOpp.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6)).<br />a. A Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required equipment. <br />b.USDA/ARS does not anticipate other qualified sources; however, should any responses be received, they will be evaluated to determine if they can meet future needs of the Government. <br />7.

Description of Market Research (FAR 6.303-2(a)(8)). <br />USDA/ARS is constantly surveying the market and from this experience knows that the equipment is proprietary and is the only on that will fit Agency needs. <br />9. Any Other Supporting Facts (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))<br />Due to the proprietary nature of the item needed to perform the research, at this time there is only one source available. <br />10. Listing of Interested Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10)).<br />No other sources are available at this time.<br />11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition (FAR 6.303(a)(11)).<br />Vendor surveys are done from time to time to see if other vendors can meet the research requirements. So far none have been able to.<br />12. Technical Requirements and Certifications; (FAR 6.303-1(b) and FAR 6.303-2(b)).<br />I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION: (FAR 6.303-1(A), 6.303-2(A)(12)).<br />I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

Our laboratory has also purchased one of the first commercially available electronic noses, and many publications have resulted using this instrument. Recently, our laboratory has increased its. Sensory evaluation testing capacity. While sensory evaluation is absolutely necessary to set industry standards for food products, instrumental measurements are often preferred as they are usually cheaper than using human taste panels. Electronic nose technology has proven effective and accurate at predicting flavor quality in fruit and fruit juices. Preliminary tests performed with USDA orange juice samples with the electronic tongue showed that juice made with fruit from trees affected by the Huanglongbing (HLB) disease could be well differentiated. An electronic tongue instrument would adequately complement the data currently obtained with the electronic nose and the taste panels, and provide standards of quality to the industry using this approach, combined with volatile and non-volatile compounds analyzed by chromatography. <br />Specifications: <br />The electronic tongue should be able to differentiate between samples with the same degree of <br />sensitivity as a taste panel. It should be built for food and beverages applicati.ons. It should be <br />equipped with an auto-sampler and the software to process the data should be compatible with <br />the software used to process electronic nose data. While there is active University research on <br />electronic sensors, only two companies make these instruments available commercially.</p>
<p><br />Shipping is to be included. Evaluation of quotations will be made based on price and suitability of equipment to meet the needs of the research unit.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 and in accordance with FAR 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote, solicitation number SP3300-10-Q-0162.

The Defense Distribution Center located in New Cumberland, PA has a requirement to purchase NetScout hardware and applications to support the Defense Distribution Center, Susquehanna Pennsylvania with their network monitoring and troubleshooting.

This is an unrestricted acquisition for vendors that can provide NetScout to meet the requirements specified.  The NAICS code is 334210.  The size standard is 1000 employees.  

This is a brand name requirement.  The current NetScout product utilized by J6N for data investigation is the only single packaged solution available that can perform the following functions:

	Graphically display automated and manual monitoring  network status
	Allows data manipulation across many protocol platforms
	Facilitates adjudication of system application errors
	Permits data gathering from multiple points within the network based on industry standard design 
	Enables flexible mining across time to speed troubleshooting of difficult issues

A NetScout product must be used for the required network expansion to ensure functionality across the DLA enterprise network.  The NetScout solution required would allow seamless expansion across the current environment utilized by DLA.  Incorporation of an alternative product would require a complete reconfiguration of the current environment and would not allow full functionality of the current solution.  

 Expansion upon the current solution with this manufacturer will allow J6N continued compatibility with system utilized by outside agencies (DISA, ETN, CCC, USAF, Army and others within DoD community) to assist with network troubleshooting when needed.

No other vendor can provide compatible hardware and software that will operate with the Legacy equipment in a single environment. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the government to award this requirement to a vendor who can provide the brand name product.

See  Attachment #1 schedule of supplies and services for CLIN identification. 

Offerors shall provide a firm fixed unit price for each CLIN and the total amount inclusive of shipping cost FOB destination.  Delivery is required 30 days after receipt of order to Defense Distribution Center Susquehanna, Attn: Michael Krause, M Avenue, Building 54 Door 8, New Cumberland, PA 17070.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>Subject:  This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) using a Statement of Objectives (SOO) approach, for benefit of the California Army National Guard (CANG) Family Readiness Program. <BR>The United States Property and Fiscal Office for California (USPFO for CA) hereby issues this RFQ with Statement of Objectives  on behalf of the California Army National Guard, to purchase Family Readiness Program services support.  This solicitation is issued in accordance with FAR part 37-Service Contracting and subpart 37.6-Performance Based Acquisition.  <BR>Set Aside: This acquisition has been set aside for total small business.  Only proposals from small business will be considered.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 624190-Other Individual and Family Services. The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $7.0 million. <BR>Quote Submittal:  Quotes must be submitted to Jeannie Thornton via e-mail to Jeannie.r.thornton@us.army.mil or via fax to 805-594-6348. Quotes are due no later than Tuesday, August 17, 2010 before 2:00pm PST.<BR>Period of Performance:  The period of performance is a 12 month base period from date of award followed by four (4) 12 month option periods.<BR>Place of Performance:  <BR>Army National Guard Facilities at: Joint Forces Headquarters, 9800 Goethe Road, Sacramento, CA 95827 and various additional locations throughout California.<BR>Statement of Objective Approach Explained<BR>Statement of Objectives (SOO) means a Government prepared document incorporated into this solicitation that states the overall performance objectives. A SOO presents the Government with an opportunity to assess the offerors understanding of all aspects of the effort to be performed, by eliminating the how to instructions to accomplish the required effort normally contained in a Statement of Work the Government provides to prospective offerors.  The SOO is used, along with other information and instructions in the RFQ, by offerors, to develop the work breakdown structure, Performance Work Statement (PWS), and any other documents supporting and defining the offerors proposed effort.  The SOO is replaced at time of contract award into the contract by a proposed and accepted Performance Work Statement. <BR>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):  A WBS should be used in developing the PWS. A WBS provides the framework for a disciplined approach of structuring and defining the total project or program.  It is a product-oriented family tree composed of (as applicable to the particular acquisition) equipment, services, and other items which make up the project or program, and provides the basis for progress reporting, performance and engineering evaluations, and financial data reporting.<BR>The SOO included in this solicitation (see attachment) provides the Governments overall objectives for this requirement.  Offerors shall use the SOO together with other applicable portions of this RFQ, as the basis for preparing their proposals, including the WBS and PWS. The offeror shall ensure all aspects of the SOO are addressed.<BR>Best Value Technical Tradeoff. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose<BR>Proposal is determined to provide the best value to the Government. FAR Part 15.101-1<BR>procedures apply to this acquisition using a tradeoff procedure as described herein. The<BR>Government will evaluate the Non-Price (Technical) Evaluation Factors listed below, including<BR>the submitted WBS and corresponding PWS, which, when combined, are significantly more<BR>important than Price, for the best value tradeoff analysis. The relative importance of Price will<BR>increase if Offerors are considered essentially equal under the evaluation of their respective NonPrice<BR>Factor Proposals. There are no sub-factors which will be separately evaluated under any<BR>of the listed evaluation factors.<BR><BR>Submissions shall be no more than 50 pages (single sided), 12 point font. Resumes are not counted against the 50 page maximum. <BR>(1) Technical Approach<BR>(1) a) Technical Approach  Submission<BR><BR>Demonstrate your firm's knowledge and understanding of the requirement as outlined in the<BR>SOO by submitting a Work Breakdown Structure and Performance Work Statement (PWS) that<BR>is contract ready. Your PWS should reflect (rather than explain) the methodology and<BR>techniques your firm shall utilize to fulfill the technical requirements described under Section 2.0<BR>Specific Program Objectives. Because the awardee's PWS shall become part of the contract<BR>terms and conditions, Contractor duties shall be worded as 'The Contractor shall.' The PWS<BR>should specify in clear, understandable terms the work to be done in providing the services to be<BR>performed by the contractor. Preparation of an effective PWS requires both an understanding of<BR>the services that are needed to satisfy this particular requirement and an ability to define what is<BR>required in specific, performance based, quantitative terms. The offerors understanding of both<BR>required services, and work effort required to accomplish should be fully demonstrated in the<BR>offeror's proposed PWS and corresponding WBS. In writing its PWS submission, your firm<BR>should avoid words and phrases such as will, as required, as necessary, periodically and<BR>any other terms that are vague and lack specific, meaningful content. Rather your PWS should<BR>use terms that are measurable, quantifiable and clear as to meaning. Your PWS should provide<BR>clear explanation and definition of terms as is apparent to be necessary. As part of your PWS,<BR>you must provide a Quality Control Plan that addresses how your firm will provide quality<BR>control for the technical service requirement of the PWS.<BR><BR>In addition to the PWS submission, the technical quote must include a listing of the proposed<BR>labor categories being proposed, the number of hours proposed for each labor category (for each<BR>time period of the contract), and a position description for each labor category, which, at a<BR>minimum, shall describe the roles, responsibilities, experience, education, and training<BR>requirements for the labor category (DO NOT INCLUDE PRICING IN YOUR TECHNICAL<BR>APPROACH SECTION OF YOUR QUOTE). Relate each labor category to its relevance in fulfilling each technical requirement under the PWS, which should be reflective of the SOO to which it responds. Along with the WBS, you may identify, describe and explain your firm's methodology and techniques as part of your larger technical quote supplementing the PWS.<BR><BR>Your firm is also required to provide a Quality Surveillance Plan (QASP) as part of its proposal<BR>which includes surveillance methods corresponding to each objective/acceptance criterion of the<BR>PWS submission.<BR><BR>This QASP must:<BR>" Identify the services and products that will be measured.<BR>" Provide surveillance methods with clear reference back to the corresponding objective<BR>and performance standard/acceptable quality level (AQL).<BR>" Define the Government role in overseeing the performance.<BR>Where subcontractors or teaming arrangements are proposed, organizational control shall be<BR>clearly delineated so as to demonstrate and ensure responsiveness to the needs of the<BR>Government.<BR><BR>(1) b) Technical Approach - Evaluation:<BR><BR>The Government will evaluate your firm's knowledge and understanding of the requirement as<BR>outlined in the SOO by assessing your firm's ability to fulfill the technical requirements<BR>described under Section 2.0 Specific Program Objectives of the SOO. As part of that<BR>evaluation, the PWS and supporting WBS submissions will be evaluated for completeness and<BR>clarity, versus vague or ambiguous language, in defining acceptance criteria for each objective<BR>listed in the SOO. The Government also will make an assessment as to whether the mix of labor<BR>categories proposed and the number of hours proposed per labor category reflect the Offeror's<BR>understanding of the requirement as also reflected in its PWS submission and any additional<BR>description of methodology and techniques. The submitted QASP shall be evaluated for<BR>completeness and clarity in defining surveillance methods for acceptance criteria in the PWS.<BR>The Government will also evaluate the submitted Quality Control Plan to ensure that your firm is likely to provide quality control for the technical service requirement of the PWS.<BR><BR><BR>(2) Past Performance<BR><BR>(2) a) Past Performance  Submission<BR><BR>Provide the following information for three (3) current or recent, past contracts of similar size<BR>and scope.<BR><BR>a. Contracting and technical point of contact names, titles, and current telephone<BR>numbers;<BR>b. Dates of performance; and<BR>c. Brief narrative relating the Contractor's past performance/experience to this task<BR>order.<BR><BR>Please have the references complete the attached Past Performance Questionnaire for each contract or task order and return to Jeannie Thornton at Jeannie.r.thornton@us.army.mil no later than the closing date of this solicitation.<BR>The government reserves the right to take into account any performance information provided by<BR>any additional sources. Past performance will be evaluated on quality of performance, cost of<BR>performance, schedule of performance, and business relations.<BR><BR>(2) b) Past Performance  Evaluation<BR><BR>The Government will evaluate the Offerors' past performance for similar projects as those<BR>described in the SOO. Performance information will be used to assess how well it has<BR>performed under these projects. When assessing the past performance information for an<BR>Offeror, the Government will consider the Offeror's explanation about the relevance of the<BR>projects listed, any problems that the Offeror encountered during the course of performance, the<BR>actions that the Offeror took to overcome such obstacles; and any quality awards or other<BR>certifications that indicate the Offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and<BR>producing the product or service required. The Government will consider past performance<BR>information regarding predecessor companies to the Offeror, but only if the Offeror explains the<BR>relationship between such predecessor companies and the Offeror. The Government will also<BR>consider the past performance information for major proposed sub-contractors and teaming<BR>partners, but only to the extent that the proposed sub-contractor or teaming partner will be<BR>performing specific project requirements. Offerors with no past performance information will be<BR>evaluated with neither a favorable nor unfavorable rating.<BR><BR>(3) Price Proposal:<BR><BR>(3) a) Price  Submission<BR><BR>A proposal that includes an overall yearly price that is excessively high or low may be<BR>considered unrealistic and unreasonable, and may receive no further consideration. Except when<BR>it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206 (b) not to be in the government's best interest,<BR>the government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to<BR>the total price for the base year. Evaluation of options will not obligate the government<BR>to exercise the options.<BR><BR>Provide a firm fixed price that is fair, reasonable and realistic for the base and for each option<BR>year. The price proposal shall also include, at minimum, the following information:<BR><BR>a) Skill labor categories (along with a description of the education and experience<BR>requirements needed for individuals to qualify for the listed category)<BR>b) Skill labor hourly rates<BR>c) Skill labor hours/day per personnel<BR>d) Skill labor total number of hours per year<BR><BR>The price proposal should include a cost reimbursable ceiling for travel in the amount of $80,000<BR>for the base period and each option period.<BR><BR>Please note that proposals should not include any costs for any materials. This project is strictly<BR>for services.<BR><BR>(3) b) Price  Evaluation. The Government shall evaluate the Offeror's total proposed price to<BR>ensure that the offered price is fair, reasonable and realistic for the project.<BR><BR>Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17 .206(b) not to be in the Government's<BR>best interest, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price<BR>for all options to the total price for the base requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate<BR>the Government to exercise the option( s).<BR><BR>Prices that are excessively high or low may be considered unrealistic and unreasonable, and may<BR>receive no further consideration for award. Proposals should avoid unbalanced pricing across<BR>option years and optional line items. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and<BR>could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an<BR>acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over<BR>or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques.<BR><BR>Additional Instructions to Offerors<BR><BR>The Government intends to award without discussions and reserves the right to award a contract immediately following the conclusion of the evaluation of initial offerors without clarifications, discussions or negotiations if determined in the best interest of the Government by the Contracting Officer. Therefore, it is critical that each offeror be fully responsive to the solicitation, its provisions and submits their best proposals initially. However, upon a complete initial review of the quotations received the Government may establish a competitive range comprised of the greatest number of proposals rated most highly as determined by the Contracting Officer. The Government also reserves the right to request Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) of offers determined to be within the competitive range established by the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>Proposals must be valid for at least 30 days from the date of submission.<BR><BR>This contract may be incrementally funded during the base period and the option period in<BR>accordance with DFARS 252.232-7007, Limitation of Governments Obligation and FAR<BR>52.232-22, Limitation of Funds.<BR><BR>Please ensure that your firm's registration on the DOD's Central Contractor Registry (CCR) system at http://www.ccr.gov/ is accurate and current.<BR><BR><BR>

<p>The NESDIS Satellite Operations Control Center is responsible for the health and safety of the nation's Weather Satellite Systems. One of those spacecraft systems is the GOES-N/O/P series of Geostationary Satellites. Engineering activities used to ensure satellite safety involve planning and exercise of procedures using spacecraft simulator equipment. <br /><br />During spacecraft manufacture and testing, several hardware upgrades were identified and completed to portions of the simulator components. Now that all three spacecraft have been launched and are being supported by OSO, Hardware Upgrades to the remaining simulator components are necessary to allow the full complement of the Spacecraft Ground System to be utilized.</p>
<p>In order to obtain updates to this hardware product and to receive support for ADI, we are required to continue Hardware Maintenance Services. The equipment and programming for this spacecraft series of simulator was developed by, and is proprietary to, Applied Dynamics International (ADI).</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334111, 1,000 employees small business size. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Amy.Sanderswhite@noaa.gov or faxed to (301) 713-0808 by July 31, 2010. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-44. The determination to compete or not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial item (Services) prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
This requirement is being issued as Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N712710A032.  This acquisition is subject to Public Law 100-656, Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and is open to all concerns regardless of size.  NAICS code: 541370.  This is a service contract and service contract wage rates apply. Service contract wage rates will be added as an amendment to this announcement.  A firm fixed price contract will be awarded for these Commercial Items (Service).
THIS ACQUISITION IS FOR THE FOLLOWING WORK:
Develop digital ortho-photo for National Park Service unit being the entire area of Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico including the detached Tsankawi Unit.
This project involves installation of ground control surveys, collection of imagery using an aerial digital camera system platform, and digital image processing as needed to produce digital orthophotography of Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico including the detached Tsankawi Unit (see attached map), with pixels sizes and remotely sensed imagery types that meet the stated specifications.
The project has been divided into two functional tasks (task 1, establishment of new survey monuments, and task 2, acquisition and processing of ADS, 4-Band multispectral imagery; most of the actual work would occur during the 2010 calendar year with receipt of final product anticipated by early 2011.
The digital orthophotography is to be acquired using a Leica ADS 40 or better Airborne Digital Sensor. The ADS40 is an airborne digital sensor with 2 or 3 panchromatic and 4 multispectral (RGB and near infrared) CCD line sensors. Each panchromatic sensor is set to collect forward, nadir and backward views, and it is able to acquire the same ground area 3 times at different viewing angles.
Collect imagery during deciduous tree leaf-off conditions when the sun angle is at least 30 under clear atmospheric conditions between mid-October and early November 2010. Imagery shall not be acquired when the ground is visibly obscured by haze, snow, frost, smoke, dust, floodwaters or other environmental factors. Final imagery shall have less than 1% obstruction due to cloud cover or other environmental factors. The Contractor shall propose flying heights (above mean terrain) for the selected areas at the selected ground pixel resolutions. The contractor shall state the proposed ground sampling distance prior to re-sampling such that the imagery is acquired with a minimum of 30% side overlap between adjacent strips. Delivery of all required product deliverables is due within 180 days of the last date of aerial acquisition including the 30-day review and 30-day edit periods. The Contractor shall provide a detailed schedule for each task, including a 30 day review period for the National Park Service to inspect the products. An additional 30 days will be included to complete edits and corrections to the data. The National Park Service will retain exclusive ownership of the deliverables developed by the Contractor. The contractor shall provide concise documentation in the form of a project report detailing methods and specifications used to establish control points and process imagery in production of digital orthophotography.
____________________________________________________________________________________TASK 1 - Establishment of survey monuments and associated geodetic surveying to create survey control monuments in Bandelier National Monument to facilitate planned imaging acquisition (see Task 2) 
Project Description: This task will entail the establishment of ten new "permanent" survey monuments at locations determined to provide adequate ground control for proposed ADS imagery acquisition. Task 1 would involve establishing a minimum of ten permanent survey monuments within Bandelier National Monument, including high-accuracy, geodetic, GPS surveying (see attached Ground Control Survey specifications) of each survey monument to establish UTM (metric) and New Mexico State Plane (English) coordinates. The survey monument effort is in support of imaging acquisition planned for fall 2010 (Task 2); the number of new survey monuments required is the minimum necessary to provide adequate ground control for post-processing of ADS imagery. Survey monuments would be sited after reconnaissance of each target area and selection of mutually agreeable locations near intended target locations. Some of the target locations will necessarily be in remote backcountry areas accessible only on foot or by horse, and all equipment and supplies would need to be carried or packed in. Priority would be given to locations that would potentially survive long-term to enable repeated use as aerial imaging targeting sites. Standard permanent monument options include: 1) 3-1/2" brass or aluminum caps cemented into bedrock, 2) pre-cast concrete monuments with brass or aluminum caps set into the ground, and 3) 3/4" rebar driven to resistance in areas where bedrock is very soft; but actual standards for this project will be developed in consultation with National Park Service staff. All control will be surveyed using dual-frequency GPS survey equipment. Static GPS procedures using high-accuracy, dual frequency GPS will be conducted for each monument. Each new survey monument will also be tied to selected existing Bandelier primary control monuments as well as to an existing control point at the Santa Fe airport (required for digital imaging projects) using baseline surveys. A least-squares adjustment of all control will be performed on the survey data and positions published in UTM (metric) and NMSP (English). National Park Service and cooperating partners reserve the right to collect independent ground control for purposes of accuracy evaluation and quality control.
Deliverables: 1) Establishment of ten (or more as required) permanent monuments within Bandelier National Monument per ABGPS survey standards (see attached Ground Control Survey specifications) which will serve as primary survey control for future mapping projects and digital imaging target; 2) Coordinates (UTM, NMSP) for survey points as component of ArcGIS shape file attribute table; 3) The contractor shall provide concise documentation of the methods used to establish control points.
________________________________________________________________________________TASK 2 - Collection of 1:3000 4-Band (R, G, B, CNIR), 16-Bit, ADS imaging of Bandelier National Monument Lands and Production of Digital Ortho-Photo Data.  Deleted Item:  Task 2 (delete 2000 Lidar evaluation @ 5K) Project Description: Finalize installation of ground control survey points, acquire 1:3000 4-Band 16-Bit airborne imagery with ADS40 or better sensor for entire park area (plus buffer) of ca. 53 square miles, process imagery and provide digital 4-Band (R,G,B,CNIR) ortho-product (15cm pixel resolution).  Ideally, imagery acquisition would occur in a single flight between mid-October and early November 2010 weather permitting (i.e. cloud cover or other environmental factors obscuring <1% of ground surface).DELIVERABLES:
Finalize Installation of Ground Control Survey PointsInstall visible targets and verify the integrity of each of the monuments prior to aerial flight. National Park Service staff will remove visible targets after the successful capture of digital imaging data.  
1) Visible target installation immediately prior to imagery acquisition
2) Provide survey tie for airport base station to targeted ground control survey points at Bandelier
Imagery Acquisition and Processing1) Set and maintain the Santa Fe Airport Base Station.
2) Acquisition of digital imagery (.5 ft or 6" [15cm] pixel resolution) for an approximately 53 square mile area using 4-band, 16 bit ADS40/SH52 digital airborne camera sensor or better. This will include approximately 100m buffers on borders where this is allowable, and up to 1000 m on the western border where that would be within the westernmost aerial swath (see attached map). Mobilization and imagery acquisition will require approximately 3-days depending on Flight Restrictions and weather.
3) Extract 5m resolution, auto-correlated DEM coverage from ADS imagery for ortho- rectification
4) Evaluate utility of existing Lidar 4ft DEM to enhance ADS 5m DEM
5) Post-processing of ADS imagery, including ortho-retification, to produce seamless, digital product (4-Band, (R,G,B,CNIR) 15cm pixel resolution) in NAD83 NAVD88 New Mexico State Plane Geoid 03 delivered on DVD or USB compatible hard drive.
6) The contractor shall provide concise documentation of the methods used to acquire and process imagery and generate the final digital orthophotography.
Optional Item: if feasible, use existing 4ft Lidar dataset to enhance ADS 5m DEM for ortho-rec		Deliver by May 1, 2011 to Bandelier National Monument, 15 Entrance Road, Los Alamos, NM 87544. 
NOTE:  Overflight permission's/ communications prior to scheduled imagery acquisition: Contractor will need to contact  NNSA (National Nuclear Safety Administration at LANL (Los Alamos National Lab) to schedule entry into restricted airspace along the Hwy 4 flight line both at main unit and Tsankawi prior to flight, as well notify staff at TA-49 Interagency Fire Center, and adhere to relevant federal (DOI/NPS) and state (New Mexico) flight safety/ coordination/ and communication standards FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable.

<p>PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition. The FAR Provision 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, and 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF, OR SUBMIT A WRITTEN RESPONSE TO, THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Understanding of the Requirement/Technical Capabilities = 40 points: The offeror shall document that they have the necessary technical capability to complete the requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW). The offeror shall be evaluated on &amp; show documentation of: (a) Staffing plan adequate to complete the requirements listed in the attached Scope of Work. (b) Licensure AND Board Certification (general radiology) and Initial Training in mammography (minimum of 3 months) (to be utilized when technology/capability is available). (c) Initial Category I Education (minimum 60 hours, 15 of these must be within the last 3 years) (d) New Mammography Modality Training (8 hrs - digital) (to be utilized when technology/capability is available). (e) Continuing Experience (3,000 General X-ray, 600 Ultrasound, 600 Mammograms, 125 CT, and 100 MRI readings during the past 12 months) (f) Continuing Education (15 Category I CMEs) (g) Radiologist(s) with experience as a Lead Radiologist for FDA/ACR accreditation activities. (h) Internal staff to conduct Medical Physicist surveys for the Review Work Station &amp; to establish local network firewalls &amp; procedures to ensure patient confidentiality &amp; security consistent with Federal requirements. Note: mammogram requirements are in place to accommodate that capability when it becomes available. (2) Past Performance = 30 points: Past performance shall be used to assess the experience &amp; quality of the offeror's past experience with the same or similar tasks in past rural orders. The offeror shall list contracts similar in complexity &amp; scope as the requirements in the SOW. The offeror shall include the following information for each contract successfully performed: (a) Name of ordering agency &amp; Contracting Officer (b) Contract number (c) Type of contract (d) Total contract value (e) Brief description of work (f) Use of technology to provide interpretations to a remotely located agency (g) Identify the contract that you consider the most successful &amp; the reason(s) for this determination ; describe process for corrective actions if problems arose; describe process for communication with the ordering agency for recommendations for improvements. (3) Cost = 30 points: The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the task in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a task order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the tasks to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among proposals with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. Technical Criteria will be 70% and cost will be 30% determining factors for this award. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s). (c) A written notice of award of acceptance or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, the test program in FAR Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-42, effective June 16, 2010.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is W912SV-10-R-0027 and is issued as a request for proposals (RFP), unless otherwise indicated herein.  This acquisition will be conducted under full and open competition to provide Dining Hall Food Preparation and Attendant Services under NAICS code 722310  Food Service Contractors with a small business size standard of $20,500,000.00 in average annual receipts. Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract awarded using Simplified Acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR 13.  Funds are not presently available for this acquisition. No contract award will be made until appropriated funds are made available.<BR><BR><BR>SPECIFICATIONS:<BR><BR>This solicitation is for the provision of all labor and expertise necessary to perform Dining Facility services listed in, and in accordance with, the Statement of Work (SOW).  Such work shall include food preparation, food serving, dishwashing, replenishing Government-provided supplies, and cleaning of dining hall and equipment. The contractor must furnish one supervisor/manager to supervise mess attendants and cooks, perform quality control functions, identify deficiencies and ensure corrective action.   The facility serves on average 400 personnel per day, which may increase to as much as approximately 1000 personnel per day during periods of increased military training.  The contractor must be able to place orders for food and certain supplies with the Massachusetts National Guard Directorate of Logistics (DOL) based upon projected meal requirements and based upon standard Army 14-day meal menus.  Period of performance is for one base year plus two option years and commences 15 August 2010.  <BR><BR>TECHNICAL FACTORS:  <BR><BR>Refer to the requirements in the Statement of Work.<BR><BR>Offerors are strongly cautioned to complete Exhibit A, Parts 1 and 2, in its entirety, in the format provided.  Failure to do so may eliminate your proposal from consideration for award. <BR><BR>Offerors shall answer each question on the Exhibit A, Performance Relevancy Questionnaire in detail.  Use as much space as necessary.  Offeror shall complete three (3) to five (5) Part 1 of Exhibit A and only one (1) Part 2 of Exhibit A.  Contracts included on Part 1 forms should demonstrate experience in performing work that is similar in scope, size, and complexity to the requirements in this solicitation.<BR><BR>Offerors should include with their proposal information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's correction actions.  Include awards, customer letters of commendation, etc., with points of contact and telephone numbers.  <BR><BR>PAST PERFORMANCE:  <BR><BR>Past Performance References  REQUIRED  Offerors shall prepare and submit to prior client(s) of the all the projects listed on their Exhibit A submission, a Reference Package (Exhibit B) (Detailed instructions are included in Exhibit B Package).  This includes correspondence explaining the requirement to obtain an independent evaluation of prior contract performance, and the Past Performance Questionnaire for use in evaluating Past Performance. <BR><BR>EVALUATION FACTORS: <BR><BR>The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to the offeror whose proposal represents the BEST VALUE in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation in accordance with the following evaluation factors for this requirement: Past Performance, Price, and Technical. <BR><BR>1.1 EVALUATION METHODOLOGY. The evaluation of qualifying proposals will consist of three parts, <BR><BR>       1.1.1 	The Source Selection Evaluation (SSEB) will evaluate an offeror's Past Performance at a factor level that most accurately defines the offeror's performance risk considering all potential evaluation criteria identified in this section. <BR>       <BR>       1.1.2 The SSEB will evaluate an offeror's technical proposal using a color rating that combines technical merit and proposal risk that most accurately defines the offeror's performance risk. <BR>       <BR>       1.1.3 	The SSEB will evaluate price and assign a go or no/go rating to each proposal. <BR><BR>1.2 	The following process will be used to determine the best value for selection of the Dining Hall Food Preparation and Attendant Services award.<BR><BR>       1.2.1 To arrive at a Best Value decision, the Source Selection Authority (SSA) will integrate the evaluation Price with Past Performance and Technical.  Technical and past performance; when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The firm that represents the best value to the Government will be selected for award.  <BR><BR>1.2.1.1 Note:  This acquisition is subject to the requirements of the Randolph-Sheppard Act. If the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind submits a proposal that meets the requirements of this solicitation (if award is made without discussions), or is in the competitive range (if discussions are held), award shall be made to Massachusetts Commission for the Blind.<BR><BR>       1.2.2 The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the contract without discussions, therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. <BR>       <BR>       1.2.3 If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<BR><BR>       1.2.4 The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; award a contract to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated; and award contracts to offerors submitting a proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.<BR>       <BR>       1.2.5 The Contracting Specialist will conduct a proposal compliance review before the convening of the Source Selection Board and refer any non-compliant proposals to the Contracting Officer and/or SSA for determination of adequacy.  Failure to comply with solicitation instructions (outlined in the solicitation) will result in the proposal being found non-responsive, rejected and eliminated from further consideration for award.<BR><BR>       1.2.6 A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>2.1 PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION <BR><BR>	2.1.1  The SSEB will conduct a performance risk assessment based upon the past performance of the offeror as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the work required by the solicitation.  The evaluation will consider the offeror's past performance considering currency, relevancy, sources, context, and trends to include but not limited to:<BR><BR>  2.1.1.1 Personnel<BR>  2.1.1.2 Ordering, Receipt and Care of Food and Related Products<BR>  2.1.1.3 Meal Preparation and Serving<BR>  2.1.1.4 Sanitation Requirements<BR>  2.1.1.5 Care of Government/Customer Furnished Property and Facilities<BR>  2.1.1.6 Safety/Quality Control<BR>  2.1.1.7 Overall Customer Satisfaction<BR><BR>			2.1.2  In conducting the performance risk assessment, the SSEB may use data provided by the offeror, and data obtained from other sources.   Contractors have been asked to submit 3-5 completed Exhibit A Part 1, one (1) Exhibit A Part 2, and  prepare and submit to prior client(s) of the all the projects listed in Exhibit A submission a Reference Package (Exhibit B)  in order to provide the Government with adequate past performance information. The evaluator may: evaluate past performance information through the use of questionnaires completed by the offeror's references (Exhibit B); use data independently obtained from other Government or commercial sources, to include but not limited to Government databases; or reliance upon personal business experience with the offeror.  The evaluation will also consider information provided relative to corrective actions taken to resolve problems on past or existing contracts.   The evaluators may contact references and parties other than those identified by the offeror, and information received may be used in the evaluation of the offerors past performance.  While the government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the offeror.<BR><BR>		 2.1.3  An offeror with no past performance shall be evaluated as neutral.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most <BR>advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors. Offerors without previous Government contracts shall also be rated neutral.<BR><BR>		2.1.4  Currency and Trends: The SSEB will consider the currency and trends of the performance information while conducting its performance evaluation.  For the purpose of this solicitation, currency is performance occurring within the last three (3) years prior to the solicitation release date.  Within this period, performance occurring later in the period may have greater significance than work occurring earlier in the period.  For example, performance information for work occurring between 1 August 2009 and the date of the proposal may have greater importance than performance information for work occurring from 1 August 2007 through 1 August 2009. <BR><BR>	2.1.5  Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposals, e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond or to resolve minor clerical errors.<BR><BR>	2.1.6  In the evaluation of Past Performance, the evaluator will use the following adjectives and related definitions to define the performance risk the contractor poses. <BR><BR>Risk rating<BR>Description of risk rating<BR>Very Low Risk<BR>Very high quality past performance.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was generally current and very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR>Low Risk<BR>Good quality past performance.  Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective actions to resolve where appropriate.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Average Risk<BR>Adequate quality of past performance.  Problems may have been identified and the contractor usually took adequate corrective action.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Although performance exceeds expectations and was rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were generally semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Above Average Risk<BR>Rather poor quality of past performance. Problems may have been identified and contractor occasionally took corrective action, but not always to the owners satisfaction.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>High Risk<BR>Unacceptable quality of past performance. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature.  Contractors corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective.  Performance was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral<BR>No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.  <BR><BR>2.2 TECHNICAL PROPOSAL EVALUATION  <BR><BR>TECHNICAL FACTORS - The evaluation of each technical proposal will access and measure the ability of the offeror to provide the specified service/supply outlined in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   To be considered technically acceptable the offeror will have to:<BR><BR>(1) Demonstrate capability of providing services that meet or exceed the requirements listed in the Statement of Work.<BR>(2) The contractor must provide an affirmative statement regarding ability to commence, and continue, food services during the Period of Performance listed in this solicitation.<BR>(3) Experience in full service Dining Facility operations and demonstrate a clear understanding of the Camp Edwards dining services mission  and technical requirements of Dining Facility food service operations <BR>(4) Provide Past Performance in similar acquisitions<BR><BR>Adjectival rating<BR>Description of adjectival rating<BR>Very Good<BR>Proposal meets solicitation requirements, demonstrates a very good understanding of the requirements and has salient features that offer significant advantage to the Government.  Very good in all respects.  Advantages/strengths not offset by disadvantages/weaknesses.  Very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Government requirements.  <BR>Good<BR>Proposal meets most solicitation requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to the Government over basic RFP requirements.  Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant, unless significant advantages are proposed that outweigh significant disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications, given by contractor, were acceptable.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government requirements.   <BR>Satisfactory<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements, but offers disadvantages (weaknesses) outweighing other advantages (strengths).  Examples may include little or no experience cited; weak proposal; mimics RFP language rather than expressing offerors approach or understanding of the RFP.  Probability of success considered less than full confidence.<BR>Marginal<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements.  Examples:  Proposal does not address all required RFP criteria; little or no experience to the extent that Overall quality cannot be determined because of errors, omissions or deficiencies that may be capable of being corrected without a major rewrite or revision of proposal.  Probability of success is questionable without further explanation by offeror.  <BR>Unsatisfactory<BR>Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations.  Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies.<BR><BR>2.3 	PRICE EVALUATION - The Source Selection Board will conduct comparative evaluations of offers concerning price.  The determination that a proposed price is reasonable should be based on the Independent Government Estimate (IGE). Pricing should be submitted as a separate attachment, to allow for non-disclosure of price until after technical and past performance have been rated.  If the price is determined to be reasonable in comparison to the (IGE) a GO rating will be given, if found to be unreasonable, a NO GO rating will be assigned to the price evaluation factor. <BR><BR>2.3.1  Discounts:  Prompt payment discounts will not be considered in the <BR>evaluation of offers. <BR>	<BR>       2.3.2  Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR><BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS:<BR><BR>Offers shall include in their proposal:<BR><BR> (1) A detailed proposal that shows pricing for Dining Facilities services as follows:<BR><BR>BASE YEAR  Period of Performance 15 August 2010  14 August 2011:<BR><BR>CLIN 0001	QTY: 1  Lump Sum 	Provide labor and expertise necessary to perform one hundred and twelve (112) days of Dining Facility Meal services.

Q:A site requirement is integration with Microsoft Office SharePoint and SharePoint sites - It seems that you have considered using Sharepoint in this instance, but have decided against it for some reason.  Can you elaborate on what's affecting your decision to use another tool?  This important answer will help provide us a basis for us to recommend a different tool to better meet your needs.
A:  We have not considered Sharepoint for this purpose.  However Sharepoint is in use and content does exist in Sharepoints throughout the NPS that we would like to access and make more accessible to everyone.
Q:In reviewing your requirements I noticed that NPS is only considering .net solutions.  Would NPS consider a superior PHP based open source solution?  
A:  The workforce capabilities within NPS require .net.
Q:REQUIREMENT 2.0 INTREGRATION - What is the need to integrate withSharePoint, when SharePoint is itself a content management system?  
A:  Sharepoint has not been deployed as a Enterprise Content Management (ECM) System.  It is more akin to a portal product than an ECM.  NPS needs a way to expose the content within the myriad of Sharepoints that have sprawled across the organization while maintaining the rich administrative capabilities of a true ECM and the usability and ease of design and information architecture that a true ECM provides.
Q:REQUIREMENT 2.0 INTREGRATION - When you mention nesting of SharePointsites can you be more specific as to what is to be accomplished here?
A:  Exposing the content within Sharepoint sites on the presentation layer so that the user does not know the difference between the Sharepoint content and the CMS content.  
Q:REQUIREMENT 9.0 IMAGE LIBRARY - Can you elaborate on what is required for"Shall include image security and workflow processes?"
A:  This is the same as any Digital Asset Management.  Managing of images needs to follow an authentication routine, and editorial workflows enabled to be applied to image management.
Q:REQUIREMENT 11.0 WORKFLOW - Shall include publishing of partial pagecontent. Does this mean creating a web page and only showing portions of iton the internet?
A:  This means that a page can be comprised of multiple "elements"/"objects" and each of those objects can be published on the page separately and/or all at the same time.   For instance, a page may have an 'image with caption' object and a 'text object' the author may decide to publish only the text and not the image or the author could publish the whole page or the author could publish the image and not the text.

This procurement is to obtain a contract for the purpose installing eyewash and deluge shower and mixing valves at the VA Omaha location.

Temperature and water pressure gauges and regulators required at each mixing valve outlet.  Wall penetration must be properly fire caulked, water piping to be installed and properly labeled with the respective to the pipe insulated.  Contractor will provide fire extinguisher and obtain burn hot work permits for each area work is performed.  No hot work shall be permitted without obtaining an all clear from safety as to smoke detectors and heat detectors as to not have false alarms.  Contractor will trace lines to find isolation valves and obtain permission from engineering before closing any water valves or cutting into any waste or drain lines.  Some work may have to be accomplished during weekend or night hours if water cannot be shut off during business hours.  This will need to be coordinated with engineering and respective departments affected in advance.  Work areas to be cleaned up at end of work day and kept clear of debris.  Dust and noise will be kept as low as possible.  HEPA filters may be required in certain areas.  Other areas may require special precautions to prevent disease spread and will be up to Department managers in some areas.  If the contractor can safely freeze some water lines to prevent widespread shut down of water this can be discussed as an option on this entire project on a case by case basis.  Check with engineering.  VA hospital plumbers will assist in locating valves as time permits, but contractor will need to trace lines as best as they can before asking for VA employee assistance.  If isolation valves aren't available or inoperable this will have to be discussed with engineering before any changes can be made.  Research building has all new isolation valves throughout the facility.  This should not be an issue in that building.

<p>Based upon Market Research analysis, the Air Force has determined that the ASC/XRA Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) services support requirement qualifies for a small business set aside. We anticipate a multiple award acquisition to teams capable of performing the entire Facility and Infrastructure (F&amp;I) operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Services and the Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis (MS&amp;A) services support for SIMAF customers. The support requirements are identified in the ASC/XRA requirements document dated 21 Aug 2009 in FedBizOps.</p>
<p>No response from industry is required at this time. A draft request for proposal for the ASC/XRA SIMAF services support is anticipated to be released later this summer or early fall. For questions concerning this post, contact Mr. Nicholas Massey or Mr. Melvin Boykins, Contracting officer, by e-mail to Nicholas.massey@wpafb.af.mil and Melvin.boykins@wpafb.af.mil, or by mail to the following address: 577 AESG/PK, Attn: Nicholas Massey and Melvin Boykins, 2145 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433-7017.</p>

<DESC><br />The U.S. Department of Education (ED) is conducting Market Research. This REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is being used to determine if sufficient interest and capability exists among all qualified vendors regarding the PRIVACY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER (PTAC). This notice is provided as information to the marketplace to determine if there are vendors capable of performing the requirements in the attached &lsquo;Draft' Performance Work Statement (PWS) . Information submitted in response to this RFI may be used as a basis for a future solicitation and/or as a basis for more in-depth research.
<p>ED's Institute of Education Sciences (IES), National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) anticipates the award of a firm fixed price contract for the PTAC that will be designed as a "one-stop" resource center for SEAs, LEAs, the postsecondary community, and other parties engaged in building and using education data bases. The PTAC's role will be to provide timely and accurate information and guidance about data privacy, confidentiality, and security issues and practices in education and closely related fields; to disseminate this information to the field and the public; and to provide technical assistance to key stakeholders. <br />PTAC will serve as a "first response" resource for questions about privacy, confidentiality, and security, but will in no way replace existing responsibilities or activities of Offices within ED or develop ED guidance surrounding privacy. For example, while PTAC will respond to initial high-level questions, it will refer questions that require a more detailed legal or statistical response to FPCO, OGC, or NCES, as appropriate. The appropriate group to respond to various questions will be determined through communications between the COR and PAC. Training materials to be developed by PTAC will be done with input, review and comment from staff in appropriate Offices at ED and must be reviewed by the COR before publication or dissemination. The materials will be shared with SEAs, LEAs, and postsecondary institutions, as well as with Offices within ED that serve those same populations. <br />Additionally, the contractor should have the necessary expertise in or have access to individuals who have expertise in legal, security, statistical and/or policy issues with regard to privacy, confidentiality and security in order to provide technical assistance on privacy issues. The contractor shall prepare materials on data privacy, confidentiality, and security practices related to education data, and also shall draw on experiences from other public service sectors (e.g., health, human services, and corrections). This work will help keep SEAs, LEAs, and postsecondary institutions current with timely and accurate methods for protecting confidentiality within public reporting activities.</p>
<p><br />In response to the Draft PWS, ED hereby solicits capability statements from all qualified vendors. <br />Capability Statement Instructions:<br />These statements shall be at a maximum 25 pages or less. Vendors should include information regarding past performance (not included in the 25 pages) of similar work from other entities including federal and state agencies and private companies. This Information should reference previously demonstrated experience at the corporate, subcontract and consultant level. If any of this experience is met through consultants, the contractor must provide evidence of commitment to work on this project.<br />Vendors should also submit resumes of proposed personnel (please see page 11 and 12 of the draft PWS). Resumes are also not included in the 25 page limit. <br />All interested parties shall demonstrate their expertise and experience related to the eleven tasks listed in the attached PWS: <br />1. Management and Project Plan<br />2. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Document<br />3. Privacy Toolkit<br />4. Training Material<br />5. Site Visits<br />6. Support Center<br />7. Regional Meetings<br />8. Technical Assistance Tracking Database<br />9. Lessons Learned Forum<br />10. Privacy Advisor Committee<br />11. Transition</p>
<p>Interested parties are asked when submitting the Capability Statements to include the following information on the title page: 1) Company Name and Mailing Address; 2) Point of contact (name, title, email address, and telephone number. All vendors should provide their size designation on their capability statement, as well as their GSA schedule contract numbers if applicable.<br />Note: The government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for providing this information. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IN NO WAY OBLIGATES THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD ANY CONTRACT. ED WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONDING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>The deadline for submitting capability statements (electronically) is July 28, 2010 by 2 pm EDT via email to the following: Sylvia.Reid@ed.gov and Sharon.Masciana@ed.gov .</p>

The work requirement under this task order will be for the Overhaul Dry Dock Steel Caisson at Trident Refit Facility, Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia.  The caisson is a critical component to the dry dock system. It is the removable door that allows vessels to enter the dry dock and when ballasted in place, at the entrance to the dry dock, allows the water to be pumped out of the dry dock.  This leaves the vessel out of the water ready to be worked on.  The caisson is approximately 117.5 feet long, 63 feet tall and 22 feet wide. NAVSEA requires a satisfactory material condition of critical dry dock structures and systems to maintain dry dock certification.  A caisson's structure and its operating systems are critical to the safe operation of a dry dock.  The scope of this repair project includes overhaul of the steel caisson exterior and interior.  The surfaces require cleaning, inspection, blasting, repair, and coating.  The tanks also require new piping, pumps and electrical.  This project will have a maximum duration of 240 calendar days from the date of award of the task order.  The task order funds are Operations & Maintenance, Navy RA.

<DESC>(c)	The APEX program is a two-part program that combines an intensive mental skills education and training workshop with an experiential learning activity. The two are inextricably linked as a developmental tool within the DAU Fellowship curriculum. In addition to teaching and developing these five critical mental skills for peak performance,  APEX has incorporated the teachings into a Gettysburg Leadership Experience, historically know as a "staff ride", in a way that blends history, leadership, and mental strength. The 2-day experience has been uniquely developed by APEX in a way that enhances our DAU Fellowship students' ability to apply the lessons learned from the Battle of Gettysburg to the development of their own leadership capabilities. Not only do they address key leadership lessons learned but also the key mental and emotional factors that directly led to leader success or failure on both sides. With the preparation the students receive in the APEX Peak Performance Mental Skills workshop prior to the Gettysburg experience, they are well armed to address these elements of the battle as they walk the battlefield. There are no other known vendors that conducts similar two part programs.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): MCMILLEN, LLC      W91238-10-D-0001-CPO2<br><br>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is a task/delivery order where an exception to fair opportunity requirements was approved as this is a follow-on order to a competitive initial order (FAR 8.405-6(b)(2) or 16.505(b)(2)(iii).<br><br>BACKGROUND: Warm Springs Dam, Lake Sonoma is located on Dry Creek, in Sonoma County, California 14 miles above the confluence with the Russian River and the City of Heasldsburg.  The San Francisco District (District) owns and operates two reservoirs on tributaries to the Russian River, Warm Springs Dam, Lake Sonoma in Sonoma County and Coyote Valley Dam, Lake Mendocino, on the EF Russian River in Mendocino County.  Both dam are multi-purpose projects, consisting of flood control, water conservation and recreation facilities operated by the US Army Corps of Engineers, San Francisco District to reduce flood damages.<BR>Warm Spring Dam was completed in the early 1980s and consists of a rolled earth embankment, with a dam crest of 319 ft above the streambed.  At gross pool, Lake Sonoma captures 381,000 acre-feet of runoff from the upper Dry Creek watershed, 130 square miles, above the Dam.  Outlet flows are regulated via the projects two service gates and multi-level low flow outlet and an unregulated ogee spillway for emergency releases.  The design flood peak inflow and outflow are 77,000 and 37,700 cubic feet per second, respectively, with 6 feet of freeboard.<BR>This study shall examine the adequacy of the Warm Spring Dam Spillway and its effects downstream of the dam, along Dry Creek and the Russian River.  <BR><BR> 3) OBLIGATION OF CONTRACTOR: The Contractor shall gather information, collect data, and perform analyses as necessary to successfully complete the tasks given in section 5 of this scope of work.  All technical work performed as part of this scope of work shall be conducted by personnel trained in hydrology and hydraulics with a minimum of 3 years of experience.  The work shall be supervised by a person trained in hydrology and hydraulics with a minimum of 10 years of experience who is also registered in the state of California as a civil engineer.<BR><BR><BR>4)  OBLIGATION OF THE GOVERNMENT: Government personnel will be available for advice, guidance, and comments on all work under this contract.  Any comment, advice and/or guidance given by the Government personnel will be to assist the Contractor in performing the work and will not change the scope of work or release the Contractor from performing all work required herein unless written notification of such, signed by the Contracting Officer (CO) is received by the Contractor.  Should the Contractor require assistance from the Government in regards to this scope, they shall contact one of the Government's points of contacts given in section 1 of this scope of work.  The Government's point of contact will then either assist the Contractor directly, or provide an appropriate point of contact to answer the Contractor's questions.<BR><BR>5)	DESCRIPTION OF WORK:   The purpose of the study is to evaluate the adequacy of the Warm Spring Dam Spillway and to determine the most likely downstream inundation area and flood depths in case of failure of the dam.   The analysis shall determine the downstream inundation caused by both with and without failure analysis of the dam for the Probably Maximum Flood (PMF), as well as the 50-, 100-, 200-, and 500-year frequency based storms and a sunny day failure scenario.  The study also includes mapping of the various failure analyses. <BR><BR>The flood wave shall be routed from Warm Springs Dam, along Dry Creek to the Russian River to the Pacific Ocean.   The District just completed a similar study for Coyote Valley Dam in July 2009.  Coyote Valley Dam is also located in the Russian River watershed, upstream of Warm Springs Dam and Dry Creek.  The Coyote Valley Dam study routed the flood wave from Coyote Valley Dam thru the Russian River to the Pacific Ocean.  The hydraulic model used for the Russian River portion of the study has already been developed as part of the Coyote Valley Dam study and shall be used for this study for the Russian River reach between Dry Creek and the Pacific Ocean.   <BR><BR>The same methodology for the Coyote Valley Dam study shall be used in this study.  This report shall be made available to the contractor for review prior to the Fee Proposal due date.  The study will include the use of existing GIS data, terrain model, flow data, high water marks, hydraulic and hydrologic models developed for the entirety of the Russian River watershed for the Coyote Valley Dam study.<BR><BR>  Additional data shall be provided to the contractor specific to Warm Springs Dam and Dry Creek.  Additional cross section data is available for Dry Creek from the District office and shall be provided to the contractor.  However, it will be necessary to develop additional channel data along Dry Creek based on FEMA profiles, site visit and older HEC-2/HEC-RAS geometries.  The hydraulic models will be calibrated and validated to available historic data.  Calibrated models will be used to model all of the events.  Data specific to calibration of the models, such as high water marks, is limited and additional research will be necessary to determine the availability and quality of such data.   <BR><BR>

<p><br /><br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN<br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p><br />I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>Contract: FA8823-07-D-0003</p>
<p>Contractor: Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) <br /><br />Requiring Activity: SMC SLG<br /><br />Acquisition Office: SMC SLG</p>
<p>Contracting Office Location: Space and Missile Systems Center <br />SMC SLG/PK<br />1050 E. Stewart Avenue<br />Colorado Springs, Colorado 80914-2902</p>
<p>Contracting Officer: Mr. Victor J. Wells<br />DSN 834-5021<br />Comm: (719) 556-5021</p>
<p><br />II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>This individual Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is for authority to increase the current contract ceiling by $15M from $49.5M to $64.5M for the Consolidated Logistics Advisory and Assistance Services (CLASS) contract provided by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).</p>
<p>The current contract was awarded on 30 August 2007 with a base period of 31 Aug 07 to 31 Dec 07and 4 one calendar year options, 1 Jan 08 - 31 Dec 08, 1 Jan 09 - 31 Dec 09, 1 Jan 10 - 31 Dec 10 and 1 Jan 11 - 31 Dec 11, respectively. If all options were exercised the Period of Performance would have provided continued sustainment support through 31 Dec 2011 with an expected total contract value of $49.5M.</p>
<p>However due to an unexpected increase in usage the current CLASS contract ceiling of $49.5M has been reached. The Space Logistics Group (SLG) initially projected the workload based on the program offices workload as of 2006. Since then program workloads have increased substantially. MILSATCOM and Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) were not originally expected to utilize this contract but now accounts for $28M in requirements. This has resulted in increased reliance on the CLASS contractor to support the program offices with expertise and experienced personnel. The increase in support hours has caused the contract ceiling to run out ahead of schedule and with that the competitively awarded contract to SAIC has effectively ended.</p>
<p>The purpose of this J&amp;A is to extend services, for six months while a competition for a follow on acquisition is performed. The work to be performed during this period is solely to complete the residual work already placed on contract that will be required prior to the award of a new contract.</p>
<p>Based on projected mission and workload requirements, the program office projects a ceiling increase of the contract value by $15M for a total contract value of $64.5M will accommodate the completion of the residual work.</p>
<p>The CLASS contract provides services in support of the operation of systems supporting the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) mission. CLASS provides A&amp;AS to the Space and Missile Systems Center Logistics Group and related space organizations using Contractor Personnel resources through a single vehicle to optimize efficiencies for: planning, programming, sustainment and implementation cycles, development of policy, decision making, management and administration, etc, provide analysis/recommendations to Research and Development activities along with Engineering and technical advice. CLASS improves the effectiveness of management processes and/or procedures. CLASS support takes the form of advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training and technical support. CLASS improves the operation of systems supporting the Air Force Space Command mission. The SMC/SLG also requires CLASS support during several phases of planning, programming, sustainment, and implementation cycles of various government systems and complements the government's technical expertise in accomplishing its mission.</p>
<p><br />III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>The proposed increase covered by this J&amp;A will allow the CLASS contractor to continue work until a follow-on contract is awarded.</p>
<p>CLASS is an advisory and assistance services contract that provides SMC and related space organizations with the capability to execute effective support and responsive acquisition management in the areas of:</p>
<p>Direct Weapon Systems Logistics A&amp;AS Support</p>
<p>Sustainment Manning Analysis<br />Sustainment Personnel Assessment<br />Maintenance<br />Supportability<br />Systems Engineering<br />Data Management<br />Supply<br />Transportation<br />Configuration Management<br />Weapon Systems Training<br />Program Management <br />Equipment Specialist <br />Tech Order Mgt Agency (TOMA) <br />System Security Engineering <br />Test and Evaluation<br />Acquisition Planning</p>
<p>The mission of the SMC SLG is to sustain and improve space weapons systems. This is accomplished by providing logistical support to various space organizations such as, but not limited to, Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), Spacelift Range System (SLRS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), Military Satellite Communications (MILSTAR), and Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS). The mission of the SMC/LG also includes providing support to the assigned System Support Managers (SSMs) and System Program Directors (SPDs) in meeting life-cycle performance and cost requirements in support to the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) and Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) mission.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>This request is made pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(l), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(B), "Only one responsible source and no other supply or services will satisfy<br />agency requirement when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements."</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLCABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br />Pursuant to the cited authority, full and open competition need not be provided when it is likely that award to any other source "would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements", FAR 6.302-l(a)(2)(iii)(B). Failure to retain the current contractor throughout the current contract duration would result in harm to government operations due to the following issues:</p>
<p>&bull; Key sustainment personnel with experience in CLASS requirements and infrastructure are critical to program stability. It is unlikely that current employees would transfer to another contractor for such a short period of time especially while SAIC would be competing for the follow-on contract.<br />&bull; The learning curve that is required would cause a negative impact on the mission. <br />&bull; Consistency and prevention of unacceptable delays in program activities are crucial to the mission.</p>
<p>SMC's ability to sustain weapon systems shall be at undue risk and shall jeopardize our ability to maintain operational capabilities of the Air Force Space Weapon Systems if we do not increase the ceiling of the current CLASS contract with the current contractor. However, to reiterate, the reason for this J&amp;A is to solely support the invoking of FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services for six months while a competition for a follow on acquisition is performed. The work to be performed during the period is solely to complete the residual work already placed on contract that will be required prior to the award of a new contract.</p>
<p><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>This effort is in the process of being re-competed and the official Source Selection process will begin soon. Market research started on 10 February 2010. This Source Selection will be a full and open competition competitive acquisition. Contract award is expected in December 2010.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The work to be performed under this J&amp;A to extend services for six months is still within the original period of performance of the contract. The Contracting Officer will utilize the current contract rates and any other necessary cost and pricing data to ensure the cost to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>Market Research is being conducted on the follow-on requirement. The purpose of this action is to provide continued contractual coverage for the advisory and assistance services support of SMC programs. The work is within the original period of performance and the ceiling is being increased to complete orders already on contract for this calendar year. A notice was posted to FedBizOps on 15 Jun 10 to inform industry of the circumstances leading to this extension and of the Government's intention to extend accordingly. The notice also reiterated the potential opportunity to contract for the subsequent follow-on effort. The Contracting Officer suspects no objections will be submitted prior to the 15-day expiration date of 30 Jun 10.</p>
<p>The current contract was issued in accordance with FAR Part 6.1 to SAIC.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />This requirement is in the process of being re-competed. The new procurement will be full and open competition. The continuation of services to the end of the calendar year is to complete the orders already on contract until a new contract can be awarded. Any other contractor other than the current contractor would cause disruptions and confusion to the programs for this short time needed to support the programs.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>N/A<br /><br />XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>The follow-on action will be full and open competition. The increase in workload leading to the sudden approach to the contract ceiling has resulted in this six month continuation of services with subsequent increase in ceiling to complete contract orders and support to the end of this calendar year.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document/Justification Review Document is evidence that he has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief. (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).</p>
<p>XIII. Technical/Requirement Personnel's Certification</p>
<p>As evidenced by the signature on the Coordination and Approval Document/Justification Review Document, the Program Manager of SLG/RM certified that any supporting data contained herein is both accurate and complete. The Program Manager for this effort is responsible for verifying the technical requirement for this effort. (FAR 6.303-2(b))</p>

Subject:  Appropriations Law Seminar Justification & Approval

*** Replaces Signed Justification & Approval posted to FBO on June 28, 2010

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:	

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.303,  justification and approval for other than full and open competition is hereby approved for the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority cited herein.

1.  CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:

Department of Veterans Affairs
Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 5     
849 International Drive, Suite 275
Linthicum, MD 21090

2.  NATURE OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:   This justification and approval is for the award of a sole source contract to International Training Consortium, Inc.  to conduct appropriations law training at VISN 5.

3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES:  

Contractor shall provide two four-(4) day Appropriations Law Seminars (Fundamental Training) in an undetermined location in the Linthicum, Maryland area on August 16-20, 2010 (Session 1) and October 25-29, 2010 (Session 2).  Estimated number of attendees for each training session is 30.  Objective of the seminar is to increase attendee's knowledge of Federal Appropriations Law as related to their scope of work within the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Training must be tailored to the Federal Government and be specific to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Contractor shall provide students/participants with an analytical framework for identifying and resolving appropriations law issues that arise within the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The total contract value is $11,950.


Contractor shall provide course materials for each student, and students will keep this course material.  In addition, four (4) Principles of Appropriation Manuals and any corresponding CDs, etc. will be provided for issuance to the facility Chief, Fiscal Service, and the VISN 5 Chief Financial Officer.  

Training certificates from the vendor shall be provided to each student upon completion of the seminar.  

Course Outline:  At a minimum, course outline shall include the entire following five (5) core areas listed below:  

1.  Anti-Deficiency Act
2.  Bona Fide Needs Rule
3.  Multi-Year Contracting
4.  Obligating and Disbursing Funds
5.  VA's Appropriations (train participants on the purposes and principles of federal fiscal law as it relates to the VA)


4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY: The requirement was procured under Public Law 109-461, Sec. 8127 (Veterans First Contracting) and in accordance with FAR 6.302-5 (Authorized or Required by Statute)


5.  RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE:  

Pursuant to Public Law 109-461, Section 8127 (Veterans First Contracting) and as codified in 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), contracting officers may use other than competitive procedures (including sole-source awards) for contracts to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) where the anticipated price will exceed the Simplified Acquisition Procedures threshold,  but not to exceed $5,000,000 (including options).

The contractor, International Training Consortium, Inc. (ITC), is a registered SDVOSB, as verified at http://www.vetbiz.gov.

6.  EFFORT TO SOLICIT POTENTIAL SOURCES:  No effort to solicit potential sources was done, since this acquisition was done as a sole-source contract award to an SDVOSB in accordance with Public Law 109-461, Sec. 8127 (Veterans First Contracting) FAR 6.302-5 (Authorized or Required by Statute).

7.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  VISN 5 has reviewed and determined that the total contract value of $11,950 is fair and reasonable.



8.  MARKET RESEARCH:  VISN 5 posted a Sources Sought notice on the Government Point of Entry at Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) on 5/27/2010 inviting companies to submit capability statements for the Appropriations Law training.  Multiple sources were identified, including ITC, a SDVOSB. 

9.  ADDITIONAL SUPPORT:  N/A

10.  OTHER INTERESTED SOURCES:  N/A

11.  FUTURE COMPETITIVE PLAN:  This will be a one-time training funded by VISN 5. No future competitions for this type of training are contemplated at this time.

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION:  I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

(1)	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition." 

	          VA North Texas Health Care System, Dallas, TX
                      VISN 17

(2)	Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 

Purchase Request 549-10-4-464-0020 for purchase and installation of  a walk-in controlled environment room for the newly activated Fort Worth Clinic,  which is projected to be fully operational and servicing eligible veteran patients by August 2010,  from Frost Environmental Rooms, Houston, TX.

		
(3)	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). 	

The requirement is to provide an environmental walk-in cooler, with an estimated value of $37,500 that must meet specific dimensions due to space limitations and is required to provide laboratory services at the new Fort Worth Community Outpatient Clinic (CBOC).  This walk-in environmental cooler will allow the clinic to store reagents, supplies, and patient samples which must be kept in a controlled refrigerated climate. 


(4)	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 
		
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253  c (2) ( or 10 USC 2304 c (2)  as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency













(5)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. 
		
Frost Environmental Rooms is uniquely qualified to furnish and install an walk-in environmental room which meets the government's specifications based on the following:

a. Due to the opening of a newly constructed Ft. Worth CBOC eligible veteran patients are scheduled for various medical service in August 2010.  Frost Environmental Rooms can provide a walk-in environmental refrigerated room, which meets the government's specific dimensions required for the Ft Worth CBOC and will not require utility changes.  Due to limited space requirements, Frost Environmental Rooms is able to accommodate the requirement without modifying equipment. Frost is also able to provide equipment, installation, and train staff on the cooler prior to the projected opening of the new Ft. Worth CBOC. Use of this vendor will ensure a contiguous, on-time installation for the new facility. 


(6)	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 
	
The contracting officer has determined that FAR 5.202(a)(2), Exception does apply to this acquisition.

      "The proposed contract action is made under the conditions described in 
       6.302-2 (or, for purchases conducted using simplified acquisition procedures, 
       if unusual and compelling urgency precludes competition to the maximum 
       extent practicable) and the Government would be seriously injured if the 
       agency complies with the time periods specified in 5.203"

(7)	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 
		
The contracting officer has determined, based on the opening of the Ft Worth CBOC and urgent need, the anticipated cost to the government are fair and reasonable.  Commercial item in the marketplace appears to be comparable or higher in terms of price.

(8)	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 
		
Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) website was checked; however no vendor appeared to be capable of meeting timeframe or specification requirements.














(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 

(i)	Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. 

There are specific dimensions required for the walk-in cooler we purchase for this clinic. The walk-in cooler from Frost Environmental Rooms meets these set dimensions and we will not have to make any utility changes.  

When FAR 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. 



(ii)	When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. 

Estimated cost of equipment, installation and training of staff is $37,500.  Due to the urgent need for the equipment to effectively store reagents, supplies, and patient samples which must be kept in a controlled refrigerated climate,  eligible beneficiary patients can potentially be seriously harmed, if  improper storage of samples may alter medical results.



(10) A listing of the sources, if any, which expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. 
	
Due to the urgent and compelling nature of the acquisition a synopsis was not conducted, pursuant FAR 5.202.

(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 

Steps will be taken to educate the customer on future requirements, in reference to Acquisition Planning.

(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. 


(b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.
