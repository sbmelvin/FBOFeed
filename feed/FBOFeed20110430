It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Wilkes Barre, PA Medical Center (WBVAMC) intends to solicit proposal from contractors in the metropolitan Wilkes Barre, PA area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about 15 May 2011.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.   

NAICS Code is 624229 ($4M) and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Dressing Sponges. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.</strong>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is July 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619)532-8537; Cindy Ingrao, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cynthia.ingrao.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-8517;Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Dressing Sponges. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $3,038,581. This forecast is based on historical Prime Vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top forty-nine (49) line items of the total one hundred twenty-four (124) line items, account for 83.89% ($2,549,071) of the total volume in sales ($3,038,581) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 8 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>A vendor interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, Ms. Cindy Ingrao, Clinical Analyst, cynthia.ingrao.ctr.@med.navy.mil and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>A vendor who does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The four (4) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement:<br /><br />1. Vendor MUST provide a line of Dressing Sponges products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below for sterile and non-sterile, woven, and latex free Dressing Sponges in a variety of materials and widths as follows: <br />a.<br />GAUZE SPONGE, 8X4 12PLY BULK NONSTERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 4X4IN 8PLY NON-STERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 4X4IN 12PLY STERILE<br />COVER SPONGE, RAYON/CELLULOSE, PEEL-BACK PKG, 4" X 4", STERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 2X2IN 8PLY STERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 2X2IN 12PLY NON-STERILE LATEX-FREE<br />SPONGE FLUFF MEDIUM 6X6 3/4IN DIAG <br />3" X 8", FINE MESH, STERILE<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Dressing Sponges.</p>
<p>b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. A vendor is required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type. (A vendor who does not have a complete product line as stated above will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Dressing Sponges product line. Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. A vendor without a DAPA number or who has not applied for a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Dressing Sponges or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. A vendor whose products are not available through the Prime Vendors or who has not applied for PV distribution will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />4. Vendor MUST submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. <br />(Note: vendor who fails to submit a discount off of DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative). Vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.</p>
<p>Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process.</span></strong> <strong>Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples.</strong> This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). Two (2) packs of each type and size listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation. <br />Gauze Sponge Dressing, 4X4IN 8PLY Non-Sterile<br />Gauze Sponge Dressing, 2X2IN 8PLY Sterile <br />Gauze Sponge Dressing 4X4IN 12PLY Sterile <br />Cover Sponge, Rayon/Cellulose, Peel-Pack4X4 Sterile <br />Sponge Fluff Medium 6X6 3/4IN Diagnostic<br />3" X 8" Fine Mesh, Sterile<br />The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate each Dressing Sponge product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) - Completely Unacceptable, two (2) - Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) - Partially Unacceptable, four (4) - Acceptable, and five (5) - Highly Acceptable. The MMESO TPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified or has not been selected will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be seventeen (17) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. The dressing sponge does not lint/release fragments of material. (Patient Safety - NPSG #7 - 07.05.01) The weave and composition of the dressing sponge must remain securely intact. The release of woven material fragments can contribute to the formation of granulomas and/or act as a foreign body which may contribute to a Hospital Acquired Surgical Site infection.<br />2. The dressing sponge is composed of a soft and absorbable material. (Patient Safety/Comfort - NPSG 07.05.01) Product should be soft and absorbable reducing risk of tissue damage to patient. Abrasive materials can damage the skin and internal tissues and contribute to bleeding, abrade tissue and cause harm to surrounding tissue which results in an inflammatory response to the tissue damage.<br />3. The dressing sponge is durable and does not fray. (Patient Safety - NPSG-7.05.01) Product will have woven material which will maintain its shape and required construction. Sponges which do not retain durability and fray can be harmful to the tissue.<br />4. The packaging must be constructed allowing for immediate sterile opening during sterile procedure and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field. (Patient Safety and Efficiency of Usage) Package edges should separate easily and evenly. Packaging/containers which open unevenly can deliver a contaminated sponge to a sterile field.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />C3 PROVISION 952.233-0001 C3 AGENCY PROTEST PROGRAM (NOV 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld. If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)/Senior Contracting Official (SCO) in accordance with FAR 33.103. A protest to C3 is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The C3 Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within C3, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>(b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the C3 Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by C3. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:</p>
<p>(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.<br />(2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.<br />(3) An award or proposed award of the contract.<br />(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.</p>
<p>(c) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (f) of this provision for resolution of protests.</p>
<p>(d) For the purpose of filing a C3 Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.</p>
<p>(e) An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(f) C3 Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from ______________________. [Contracting Officer designate the official or location where a protest may be served on the Contracting Officer.]</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
