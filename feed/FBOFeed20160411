<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334515 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.
<p>AFRL requires QTY- 3 CapaciTorr CF 35 J, QTY-3 C 400-2 DSK, QTY- 1 CapaciTorr CF 35 D 400/B 200 Power Supply, QTY-1 Cable Mains Input CF 35 3MT and QTY- 1 Cable Supply Output CF 35 D400/B200 3MT.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with SAES Getters USA, Inc. 1122 E Cheyenne Mountain Blvd. Colorado Springs, CO 80906.</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source has a&nbsp;commercial offering that can meet the required performance in order&nbsp;to achieve and maintain vacuum of 10-12 Torr.&nbsp; The CapaciTorr D 400-2 pumps use a high performing S172 (Zr-V-Fe) material in the form of disks in order to achieve high pumping performances in a very compact configuration.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Brooke.Hoffman@us.af.mil . Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice.

<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>

<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

WILDLIFE CATCHMENT MINIMUM TANK SPECIFICATIONS

The dome top plastic Wildlife Catchment Tank shall be a minimum of 1,800 gallons, cross-linked polyethylene with bird ladder and 1.25" pre-installed overflow pipe adapter.

The wildlife water catchment tank shall be manufactured of rotationally molded high density cross-linked polyethylene with ultraviolet inhibitors, suitable for watering wildlife. Wall thickness shall be strong enough to contain fluids of 1.65 specific gravity to withstand solid freezing.  Capacity of the catchment tank shall be 1,800 gals at a 24" high drinker level. The assembled cover and tank shall be no more than 8.5' wide by 16' long to allow transport to the field without special permits. The catchment tank including the dome cover shall be strong enough to withstand elk, cattle, and snow loads without collapsing, puncturing, or cracking.  The cover shall easily attach/detach for transporting and field placement.  The cover shall attach to the tank with 3/8" stainless steel bolts, nuts, and washers to preclude rusting. The total weight of the tank and cover shall be about 800 pounds.  The cover shall have a minimum 17 inch inside diameter man way to allow access to the tank for cleaning.

The drinker shall be integral to the tank and require no float valves to function.  The water holding portion of the tank shall be seamless one piece construction to eliminate potential leaks.  The drinker and small animal ramp are to be molded of the same cross-linked polyethylene into the cover to reduce maintenance created by separate parts.

Catchment tank and cover shall be dark brown in color. No painting shall be required; the color of the tank shall be inherent to the tank material.   

The catchment tank shall be constructed so it can be partially buried (up to the drinker lip if required) to achieve a maximum above ground level of 20 inches.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) hereby announces its intent to award a sole source contract to LEAP Technologies, Inc., 610 Jones Ferry Road, Suite 100, Carrboro, NC 27510-6113 for the acquisition of a LEAP Technologies Dual Head PAL3, RSI/RSI Autosampler.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.</p>
<p><br />The period of performance for this procurement is one 60-day base period.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is for LEAP Technologies, Inc. to provide the Dual Head PAL3, RSI/RSI Autosampler. LEAP Technologies is the only company that makes a compatible Dual Head PAL3, RSI/RSI Autosampler. The PAL3 Autosampler uses a system of servos which make it more reliable by reducing transport errors and fiber breaks to the barest minimum. This ability helps to streamline maintenance operations in our laboratory; thereby reducing the cost of replacing broken fibers. The new PAL3 Autosampler, apart from having a better mechanical design, comes with Chronos software that is compatible with our Agilent 7890A GC instrument software Chemstation. In essence, because we are familiar with the Chronos software, communication errors between instruments are prevented. The PAL3 Autosampler's Chronos software allows for single sample list control and optimizes intelligent time-management control. This is essential for our headspace and Solid Phase Micro-Extraction (SPME) automation that is required for our SPME headspace measurement of NHANES samples. It will not be feasible to purchase another type of Autosample that is not compatible to the Agilent 7890A GC Chemstation. To do so will alter the results of our ongoing study. This system also employs a dual arm system on one rail that is an exclusive product to LEAP Technologies, Inc. The dual system will allow for future automation and possible development of new methods. Other systems are not compatible with our Agilent 7890A GC Chemstation and prevent instrument communication signals, thereby causing delays and loss of sample data. There is no other company that can provide the required instrumentation with the ability to perform as the LEAP Technologies, Inc. Dual Head PAL3, RSI/RSI Autosampler.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps.com. We will issue only one solicitation to LEAP Technologies, Inc. However, all responsible sources who believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications to Tonya S.

<p>The period of performance for this procurement is one 60-day base period.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is for Cerulean Corporation to provide the Shisha Single Port (SPS100) Smoking Device. This is the only commercially available smoking machine designed specifically for smoking water pipes. Its unique design allows for the use of an Electrostatic Trap for measuring metals. Additionally, it allows the user to adapt the Shisha for use as a Hookah by way of the Beedi Holder Adapter Kit. This instrument also has an adaptation for an Impinger Kit as well. These additional attachments make this the only commercially available unit of its kind. Other instruments did not have the flexibility of the SPS100. Their instruments lacked the addition of the Electrostatic Trap as well as the Impinger Kit, all of which are essential to our analysis. There is no other company that can provide the required instrumentation with the ability to perform as the Cerulean SPS100.</p>

<p>The period of performance for this procurement is one 12-month base period.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is for National Ground Water Association to provides services taking pre-existing data and putting it into a form that can be distributed to public health practitioners to improve well water outreach and education programs. In 2011, the Health Studies Branch of the National Center for Environmental Health launched the Clean Water for Health program to build state and local capacity to protect populations and communities served by unregulated drinking water systems. In 2014, the National Ground Water Association (NGWA) along with subcontractors, the Water Quality Association (WGA) and the Ohio State University College of Public Health (OSU), was awarded a contract to aid the program by addressing a gap of current knowledge and understanding to identify the types and provide examples of educational campaigns that are most effective at getting well owners to 1) regularly test their unregulated drinking water, and 2) implement interventions to reduce exposures to contaminants. This acquisition will further this work by using the data from the final report to develop manuscripts, presentations at national partner conferences and a toolkit for water programs across the United States.</p>
<p>NGWA, who conducted the initial literature search, data collection, and analysis, is the only entity who can do this work because they are familiar with the data that were collected, how they were compiled and analyzed, the interpretation of the data, and the best ways to take the information gleaned from the original project and translate it into dissemination products to inform public health.</p>

Propensity score matching is a well-accepted statistical technique for generating samples based on strata. YouGov has a panel of over 1 million participants and is able to provide estimates at both the national and state level. Because YouGov's samples are demographically representative of the U.S. and of each state, it will allow us to generalize the findings to the U.S. and each state. Their winter survey included questions that capture constructs relevant to our program's goals (i.e., awareness of why some children struggle in the U.S., support for alternative strategies to help children succeed, current child-rearing practices and perceived social norms related to child maltreatment). In addition, the data was collected prior to the national screening of The Raising of America, a documentary that Essentials for Childhood is using to raise awareness and commitment. Therefore, YouGov's data is timely for our baseline. Other products considered were not acceptable because their panel is small (~50,00 compared to YouGov's 1 million participants), unable to provide state-level estimates, used highly skewed samples or unwilling to disclose the size of their opt-in panel. In addition, other products used a random-digit-dial to select their sample with mail follow-up; this method is problematic due to non-response and public movement to cellphones. YouGov is the only company that can meet our requirements.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps.com. We will issue only one solicitation to YouGov America, Inc. However, all responsible sources who believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications to Tonya S. Justice, Contract Specialist, via email to TJustice@cdc.gov NO LATER THAN 6:00pm EST on April 26, 2016. Reference solicitation number 2016-Q-64954 in the subject line of the email.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and is solely in the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>THIS REQUEST FOR QUOTATION IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET&#8208;ASIDE.  QUOTES MUST BE FROM A SMALL BUSINESS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.
NOTICE: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is issuing the following Request for Quote (RFQ), set&#8208;aside for small businesses, for a MonoCL Swift Cathodoluminscence System per the item/minimum specifications included here in.  This requirement is a total small business set&#8208;aside. Only quotes submitted by small business concerns will be accepted by the Government. Any quote that is submitted by a vendor that is not a small business concern will not be considered for award.
Interested vendors are strongly encouraged to submit their quotation on the RFQ Standard Form (SF) 18, and provide all supporting documents, as necessary, via the FedConnect portal at www.fedconnect.net. The vendor?s quotation may also be accepted via email and fax. Vendors may email their quote to the Contract Specialist assigned to this requirement, Mr. Robert Mohn, at Robert.Mohn@netl.doe.gov or send by fax to 412&#8208;386&#8208;5770, Attn: Robert Mohn, by the due date and time indicated in Block 10 of the RFQ SF&#8208;18. Mr. Mohn can also be reached by telephone at 412&#8208;386&#8208;4963. If submitting a quote via FedConnect, please do not also submit via email.
EVALUATION: An award shall be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote.  For award purposes, the lowest priced response will be determined by factoring in the base item only (and not the individual optional items, although they will be reviewed for price reasonableness prior to award). An award shall be made to the responsible vendor submitting a technically acceptable quote and offering the lowest evaluated price. To be considered for award, vendors must quote on all items/services listed in the solicitation. Vendors shall submit descriptive literature detailing features, technical capabilities and warranty data (as necessary for an acceptability determination by the Government). Technical acceptability shall be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this solicitation as it compares to the item/minimum specifications included here in. The technical acceptability determination will be based meeting the salient characteris tic of the item included within this RFQ. Therefore, it is essential that vendors provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability. Compliance shall be determined by the vendor?s provision of literature showing performance capabilities or through written narrative discussing the points not covered by the published literature.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203 to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">In 2001, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) sponsored the creation of the National EMS Research Agenda; this document, among other important topics, advised the EMS community to apply evidence from scientific research to improve pre-hospital patient care. In 2006, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) furthered this recommendation by also advocating for evidence based guidelines (EBGs) in its report on the Future of Emergency Care in the United States. These documents led to recent efforts to create nationally accepted evidence-based guideline model process that will allow Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Systems to provide scientifically validated and more effective, pre-hospital care to the American public. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">NHTSA and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) recently sponsored the development of a number of EBGs focusing on topics such as pain management, trauma care, air medical transportation of trauma patients, pediatric seizure management, and pediatric respiratory distress. In addition to sponsoring the creation of EBGs, NHTSA is exploring the implementation of EBGs at the State level through a cooperative agreement awarded to the National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) in 2012. As more EBGs are created and are adopted by States and EMS systems, it is critical that a method for tracking their implementation and effectiveness is conceived.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The first step in tracking the implementation and effectiveness of EBGs is to assess the utility of currently available medical data from EMS information systems, States, and the Federal Government. Most States are now participating in the National EMS Information System, commonly known as NEMSIS, which provides the framework for collecting, storing and sharing standardized EMS patient care data. Participating States collect and transmit a subset of their data to the National EMS Database, where it is available for EMS stakeholders, researchers and public use.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The existence of these sources of data provides a potential mechanism to track, assess, and understand the impact of pre-hospital EBGs on patient treatment from motor vehicle crashes and other health emergencies. Unfortunately, it is unclear whether the appropriate data exist or are in the appropriate format for scientific assessment of the implementation and effectiveness of new EBGs. <span style="COLOR: black">NHTSA's objective is to receive professional services to</span>: 1) create performance measures to assess the implementation and effectiveness of the EBGs over time; 2) determine whether the appropriate data exist in national and State databases to monitor and assess EBG implementation; 3) provide suggestions to State and national database managers that will assist them in modifying databases to improve EBG tracking; 4) Create performance measures for EMS agencies/systems to evaluate their implementation of EBG's; and 5) if appropriate data exists, to track the implementation and effectiveness of EBGs, and analyze the currently available data to show the beginning stages of EBG implementation.</span></p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order without providing full and open competition to Pacific Biosciences, 1380 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025 to provide a service contract for a PACBIO RSII SEQUENCER SYSTEM (BRAND NAME: PACIFIC BIOSCIENCES).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. The National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a high-throughput sequencing center supporting all institutes within the NIH. NISC has served the NIH community for over 15 years and established in 1997, as a source for high-quality large-scale sequencing and analysis. NISCH is a multi-disciplinary genomics facility that emphasizes the generation and analysis of DNA sequence. In addition to providing investigators at the NIH access to large-scale DNA sequencing, NISC plays a major role in several efforts related to the Human Genome Project including a Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative, the ENCODE Project, and the Mammalian Gene Collection Program. NISC is also an active participant in the International Sequencing Consortium.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives</span>:</p>
<p>The purpose of this sole source solicitation is to procure a service contract for NHGRI/NISC for a Pacific Biosciences Pac Bio RS II Sequencer System. Pacific Biosciences Pac Bio RS II Systems is a Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT&reg;) DNA Sequencing System that provides the highest consensus accuracy and longest read lengths of any available sequencing technology.</p>
<p>NHGRI/NISC has a PacBio RS II, which is used to produce sequence reads in excess of 30 kb, but more typically 8-10kb. The length of the reads plus the lack of significant sequence bias in this method leads to full coverage of the genome, whereas other methods consistently leave gaps. This coverage enables determination of structural variation and repeat content as well as copy number data, all of which are difficult to discern from short read sequence data. In addition, RNA samples can be sequenced to discover the full spectrum of isoforms for genes of interest, and information about base modifications can be determined since this instrument is capable of sequencing directly from native DNA without amplification. The PacBio RS II instrument is critical for these types of studies, and is thus a vital component of NISC sequencing production pipeline. It is imperative that the PacBio RS II System is well maintained and operational so that NISC's work can be completed in a timely fashion and will not result in any disruption.</p>

Further details will be provided in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to inform interested Offerors of an overview of the type of task orders to be awarded.<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: Batang; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: KO; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">The Epidemiology Branch is an intramural research group within DIPHR that designs and conducts original epidemiological, behavioral, and biostatistical research encompassing several research domains such as human reproduction and development, pregnancy and related complications, pediatric and adolescent health and behaviors, and methodologic research relevant for our mission. &nbsp;The Division comprises three intramural research branches, Epidemiology, Biostatistics &amp; Bioinformatics, and Health Behavior, and its mission is to design and implement original research with the potential for high impact findings for public health and its special populations. &nbsp;An area of particular interest is pregnancy and related complications and how they may be associated with offspring health. &nbsp;There is growing evidence of the importance of intrauterine exposures, as animal and human studies have suggested that adverse intrauterine exposures may lead to permanent fetal adaptations in anatomy and physiology, which may be beneficial for short term fetal survival, but result in an altered long-term risk of disease later in life. Therefore, there is a critical need to establish cohorts from which to be able to address questions regarding the transgenerational impacts of intrauterine exposures, including GDM and obesity.<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: Batang; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: KO; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">The primary purpose of the proposed contract is to establish an infrastructure to investigate the long-term transgenerational impacts of maternal obesity and GDM on the 1) metabolic health, 2) vascular health, and 3) reproductive health of the offspring, their determinants and the underlying molecular mechanisms. NICHD is looking for potential sources that have access to an existing cohort of mothers from which to follow-up the offspring to address these questions. &nbsp;NICHD is looking for potential sources that can demonstrate and document experience in recruitment, monitoring, and retention of participants in pregnancy studies, and their offspring.&nbsp; The contractor should have the infrastructure in place to manage and monitor the proposed research study and provide oversight and quality control to recruit mother-offspring pairs from an existing cohort in order to collect new data and biospecimens to fulfill the study objective. &nbsp;The Contractor shall have an established cohort from which to recruit approximately 5000 mother-offspring pairs (with the offspring at least 13 years of age) or subcontract with such a cohort. &nbsp;The established cohort should include comprehensive historical data on women and their offspring that has been prospectively and longitudinally collected. &nbsp;By building upon an existing cohort(s) and applying a hybrid design combining new data collection with comprehensive historical data on women and their offspring the proposed contract aims to address critical data gaps in a timely and cost efficient manner. Recruitment will be monitored to ensure that the recruitment targets have been met. &nbsp;The contractor should demonstrate experience in scientific clinical studies management, training, and current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work.Overall, the contractor will be responsible for: &nbsp;supporting development, implementation, recruitment, coordination and monitoring of the study.</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: Batang; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: KO; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">&nbsp;<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: Batang; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: KO; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about April 26, 2016 on FedBizOpps (FBO) website: <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov/">http://www.fedbizopps.gov</a>. &nbsp;The due date for submission of proposals in response to the RFP is anticipated to be on or about June 10, 2016. &nbsp;Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement. &nbsp;This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712. &nbsp;Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted in electronically to Theresa Koomson, Contracting Officer, at </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: Batang; color: #535353; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="mailto:koomsont@mail.nih.gov">koomsont@mail.nih.gov</a>,</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: Batang; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: KO; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"> or Alice Pagan, Contracting Officer, at </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: Batang; color: #535353; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="mailto:pagana@mail.nih.gov">pagana@mail.nih.gov</a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: Batang; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: KO; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">. &nbsp;No collect calls will be accepted. &nbsp;This is not an RFP and this announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract. &nbsp;The reference number to be used for this announcement is: RFP NIH-NICHD-DIPHR-2016-1. &nbsp;All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided.</span>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR BIDS<br />(Term: Up to 5 Years)
<p>A. The National Park Service and Gateway National Recreation Area</p>
<p>1. The National Park Service and its Mission</p>
<p>America's National Park Service was created by Congress to "conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such a manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." Additionally, the Congress has declared that the National Park System should be, "...preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States." The National Park Service has as its overall mission the preservation and public enjoyment of significant aspects of the nation's natural and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>To learn more about the National Park Service, visit our website at www.nps.gov. This site includes information about who we are, our mission, NPS policies and individual parks.</p>
<p>2. Gateway National Recreation Area<br /> <br />Gateway National Recreation Area (Area) provides a national park experience in the country's largest metropolitan area. The park preserves a mosaic of coastal ecosystems and natural areas interwoven with historic coastal defense and maritime sites around New York's Outer Harbor. Beaches, marshes, waters, scenic views and open space offer resource-based recreational opportunities to a diverse public. It is a getaway for millions of visitors every year.</p>
<p>The Area includes 26,000 acres of land and water, spanning locations in New York and New Jersey. It has three distinct, non-contiguous areas: Staten Island, Sandy Hook and Jamaica Bay. Except for Sandy Hook, which forms the northern tip of the New Jersey shore, the Area occupies coastal land in the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island in the City of New York.</p>
<p>Located on a peninsula in Staten Island, Great Kills Park-part of Gateway National Recreation Area-is 580 acres of open space where visitors can enjoy many recreational amenities or explore the wildlife still thriving in New York City. Great Kills Park is known locally for its ecological resources. It is home to the only osprey nesting site on Staten Island and contains special nesting platforms provided for the birds to inhabit. The name Great Kills originates from a Dutch word meaning "many creeks." Today, the waters are popular with boaters and fishermen alike.</p>
<p>In the Area's enabling legislation, the NPS was directed to conserve the natural resources, fish, and wildlife of the Jamaica Bay area and to permit no development or use of this area incompatible with this purpose (16 U.S.C. &sect; 460cc). Additional information on the Area can be found at www.nps.gov/gate.</p>

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (NFLC) Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to competitively procure the  digitizing and conversion of all Navy and Marine Corps Membersâ€™ Service Treatment Records (STRs), both Medical and Dental, and the management and delivery of the scanned STRs to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) through  the automated Healthcare Artifact and Information Management Solution (HAIMS) repository system in support of the Department of the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED).  BUMED estimates the workload at 12,000 STRs per month which equates to 2.5 million digitized images per month.  The required services shall be performed at a contractor owned and operated facility located within 30 miles of the BUMED Project Management Office (PMO), BUMED Detachment, 4300 Good Fellow Blvd, Bldg 103, St.
 Louis, MO 63120, hereafter referred to as the central cell conversion center. 

The contractor shall provide conversion services of paper STRs (Medical, Dental, ALHTA Web Print (AWP), and DD-2963 processing) and loose medical documentation; document preparation to include validation of scanning, indexing, reassembly of folders, and confirmation of delivery of images in a searchable electronic format to the HAIMS repository system; and programmatic support services.  

The contractor shall furnish the requisite technology and associated scanning equipment, hardware and software infrastructure, tools, materials, staff, and other services as necessary for the performance and management of conversion services of paper STRâ€™s to electronic images.
   The contractor shall convert the paper based STRs to electronic images at 300 dots per inch (dpi) in a Portable Document Format (PDF).  The contractor shall deliver data that is 99.5% accurate, complete, and comprehensive to include 100% image of all usable documents.  The contractor shall transfer the scanned information into the HAIMS system via a government approved and provided Information Technology (IT) Network connection. The Government approved and provided IT network, exclusive of scanning equipment, will be furnished by the Government until such time as a Business to Business (B2B) connection into Military Health System (MHS) is established by the contractor and approved by the Government.
  The contractor will have one year from date of award to obtain approval and establish the necessary Business to Business (B2B) connection to the MHS.

The required programmatic support services include technical support for identification, tracking, implementing, uploading into HAIMS, analyzing, and reevaluating comprehensive compliance initiatives for the STR process.  In support of these compliance initiatives, the Contractor shall analyze and provide metrics on a weekly basis on such data as:  the total number of unique SSNâ€™s received and uploaded into HAIMS, which are greater, and less than 45 days; average number of days from receipt to upload into HAIMS; and break down by active duty, reservist, echelon II commands, UICâ€™s, and parent command.
  The Contractor shall analyze the data and provide delinquency rates by Echelon II commands and individual UICâ€™s/parent command to the NMRA PMO/COR. The metrics developed by the contractor shall be utilized for the purposes of assisting BUMED with developing presentations for instructions, executive conference, and meeting facilitation; training; and document publication/distribution as it pertains to the Navyâ€™s metrics in meeting the Secretary of Defense Compliance initiatives for the STR process.  The contractor is not responsible for conducting the presentations, meeting, training, etc., solely for assisting with its developments.  

The contractor shall support short-term projects and produce a minimum of two (2) standard reports each week for the purposes of improving STR timeliness, tracking, and processing that must be completed with a product such as definitive reports or presentations as an output.
  The contractor shall develop these projects based off the needs of the Government such as:  how many STRs are shipped from a particular MTF for a particular time; how long does it take an STR on average to be shipped from a particular MTF; and what particular type of STRs are being shipped from an MTF during a particular timeframe.  The contractor shall have additional reporting requirements as implementation compliance process matures.  The reporting requirements shall be focused on STR processing to include timeliness, monitoring of STRs processed and upload timeframes into HAIMS.  This shall include ADHOC reports that are uncharacteristic in type because of the timeliness requested by senior leadership.
  Contractor can expect a minimum of 10 or less ADHOC report requests during a month, which can include: STRs NOT manifested but received; or SSNs mistyped on the manifest; total number of STRs received for unique SSNs; percentage uploaded within 45 business days; and average number of days to upload into HAIMS.  The Contractor shall respond to ad hoc report requests as required.  The Contractor shall also develop training/lesson plans for end users located at MTF/ Dental Treatment Facility (DTF) for packing and shipping records, and shall host 4-5 Defense online Collaboration Services (DCS) training sessions per year, scheduled via NMRA PMO/COR. 

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate competitively on a 100% Small Business Set Aside (SBSA), best value basis.
 The placement of a single Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) contract is anticipated encompassing a Base Period or Performance commencing on or around 01 January 2016 through 31 December 2016, plus four one-year option provisions to extend the term of the contract through 31 December 2020, if all options are exercised. The Government is using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described services. Interested vendors will be requested to submit both non-price and price proposals. The evaluation for contract award will consider the non-price proposal more important than the price proposal.

<DESC>Synopsis
A-E Solicitation for Indefinite-Quantity Type Contracts for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4

The U.S. EPA is seeking qualification statements from Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for various A-E services in the states covered by EPA Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4. The states in the covered area are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.  The EPA does not have major facilities in all of these states. Work will primarily be at completed at major EPA-owned or leased facilities at the following locations:  Research Triangle Park, NC; Edison, NJ; Gulf Breeze, FL; Athens, GA; Narragansett, RI; Montgomery, AL; Fort Meade, MD; and Chelmsford, MA.

EPA intends to award one or more indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts under this acquisition, with a target effective date of April 1, 2017.  Each contract is expected to have a five-year performance period, with a minimum order amount of $25,000. The estimated value of a contract is $3 million. Task orders are expected to typically range between $25,000 and $250,000, although some will likely be higher or lower.  Loaded hourly rates (inclusive of overhead and profit) for each major discipline will be negotiated for each contract year. These loaded rates will serve as the basis for pricing task orders. 

Task orders under each contract are expected to include the preparation of designs, plans, specifications, cost estimates, studies and reports, surveys, and construction phase services. Projects may involve alterations, renovations and additions to research facilities and office buildings, including site and infrastructure. The work will primarily involve government-owned property, but leased property may be included. Work will be submitted in hard copy report format, hard copy D-size drawings, and/or CADD and other electronic formats. 

The services required may include all major professional A-E disciplines, including architecture, electrical and mechanical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, landscape architecture, cost estimating, lab planning, space planning, and construction phase assistance. Required disciplines will vary by project. Additional information relative to specific EPA projects to be performed under any resulting contract(s) is not available at this time.

The required A-E services are being procured in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer Selection Act (P.L. 92-582) as implemented by FAR 36.6 and EPAAR 1536.6. Selection will be non-project specific. Firms will be selected for contract negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. 

This procurement is a total small business set aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330, Â¿Engineering ServicesÂ¿, and the relevant small business size standard is average annual receipts for the last three (3) fiscal years not exceeding $15 million. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to contract award (FAR 4.1102). Register via the SAM website at https://www.sam.gov.

SIGNIFICANT EVALUATION FACTORS -- The A-E must demonstrate its qualifications and the qualifications of each key team member, with respect to the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance:

(1) SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE and TECHNICAL COMPETENCE - Specialized experience and technical competence in programming, design (including energy conservation and sustainable buildings design), and construction phase services for analytical and research laboratories, laboratory support facilities, office space, and laboratory support facilities. Identify recent experience (within the last 5 years) of the A-E team members, individually and collectively as a total team in renovation projects for research facilities, associated office and support space, and infrastructure, including project surveys, studies, designs, including working drawings and specifications, cost estimates, and construction phase services. Recent LEED project certification experience is required.  Recent experience in energy modeling and ASHRAE Standard 90.1 is required.  Recent experience in new research facilities will be evaluated favorably. It is very important that the documented experience demonstrates the ability and willingness of the A-E to respond to small-to-medium-sized projects, as they are expected to be the most common under any resulting contract.

(2) PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS - Professional qualifications in the following disciplines: (1) Licensed Architects with LEED Professional Credentials. (2) Licensed Mechanical Engineers with LEED Professional Credentials (3) Licensed Electrical Engineers (4) Licensed Structural Engineers (5) Licensed Civil Engineers (6) Licensed Landscape Architects. The evaluation will consider demonstrated, documented, and relevant education, training, registration, voluntary certifications, overall and relevant experience (highlighting recent achievements within the last five years), and longevity with the firm of key management and technical personnel. Additional certifications (e.g., LEED, NCQLP, CEM, and ASHRAE) will be evaluated favorably. The submittal shall demonstrate that the A-E and its team members have all the necessary licenses and certifications required to provide professional design services. Each design discipline shall be supervised by a licensed professional in the respective discipline. All key personnel must be professionally registered in their discipline.

(3) CAPACITY - Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates. The submittal should indicate the A-EÂ¿s present workload, and demonstrate the capacity to perform approximately $500,000 in EPA A-E work in a one-year period. Identify all current projects being designed in the A-E firmÂ¿s office, showing dollar value, start date, completion percentage, and the anticipated completion date. List any ongoing or anticipated projects that are expected to be active after April 1, 2017.

(4) PAST PERFORMANCE - Past performance on Government contracts and private industry contracts with respect to the quality of work conforming to good workmanship, cost control, and compliance with performance schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior; commitment to customer satisfaction; and business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Points of contact provided under other criteria may be contacted by EPA for reference purposes.  Provide facility owner documentation of the firmÂ¿s performance for each project listed as experience under Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 above.  If no documentation exists, so state on the SF330. For each project provide name, title, address, telephone number, and e-mail address of ownerÂ¿s representative. 

Provide a current client reference point of contact for a minimum of five (5) relevant projects completed in the last two (2) years. Provide for each project name, title, address, phone/fax number, and e-mail of ownerÂ¿s representative. A desire for smaller projects, but also the ability to handle medium sized projects, should be demonstrated. Provide the estimates for the relevant projects that were listed, identifying the initial A-E construction budget, bid price of project, amount of change orders and percent of changes for the various major divisions (architectural, mechanical, electrical, structural, and civil). Provide copies of awards and letters of appreciation/commendation. 

Provide a current client reference for at least one (1) LEED Certified project.  Provide more than one (1), if necessary to document the past performance of the Architectural and Mechanical team members.  Provide the name, title, address, telephone number and email address of ownerÂ¿s representative.

Identify any projects on which proposed team members have previously collaborated.  Attach to the SF 330 a chart showing which team members worked on each project.

(5) LOCATION -- Firms must have an existing active design production office in the general geographic area, with preference given to firms located within 100 miles of Research Triangle Park, NC; Edison, NJ; or Gulf Breeze, FL.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested parties having the capabilities to perform this work must respond to the solicitation package and submit a letter of interest along with four (4) copies of Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, and four (4) copies of any attached additional photographic and/or technical materials.

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT<br />Air Force Contracting Information Technology (CON-IT)<br /><br />The Business Enterprise Systems (BES) Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Acquisition Systems and Support Branch, HIBB, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), Ohio is issuing a Sources Sought to gather information intended to gain knowledge of industry capabilities regarding the CON-IT program. The information gathered is intended to be used as part of market research for the CON-IT program. Potential vendors shall not consider this as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or request for proposal; nor shall potential vendors consider this request as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. This is a market research survey to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. There is no solicitation at this time and requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Any and all direct or indirect costs or charges incurred by any vendor arising as a result of this notice are the responsibility of the vendor and shall not result in any obligation to the Government. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.</p>
<p>The Air Force is utilizing the Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) Integrated Defense Enterprise Acquisition System (IDEAS). IDEAS is a mature operationally proven Government-Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) contract writing solution built on the Appian Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Business Process Management (BPM) platform. IDEAS will be configured and further developed to become CON-IT and meet the AF's requirements for the contracting community. The requirements will include at a minimum services for development, integration, data migration, training, sustainment and maintenance. There is a Bullet Background Paper, Attachment 1, which provides a high overview of the requirements for the CON-IT acquisition.</p>

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services. All interested and qualified sources, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond. If interested as a prime and considering the type of technical capability required for this work, your company must be capable of performing 51% of the work for this requirement. There is a CON-IT Quad chart, Attachment 2, includes questions regarding services, capabilities, key commercial and government customers, and business size status. Please answer all of the questions from the Quad Chart in an executive summary format. The executive summary format is at the discretion of the vendor and there is no page limitation on your responses. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s). In addition to the questions in the quad chart the following information must be provided in the executive summary:</p>
<p>a. Company Name and Address<br />b. Company Business size for NAICS Code<br />c. Identify participation in HubZone Small Business, 8(a) participation, Veteran-Owned Small Business (VSOB), Service-Disabled Small Business (SDVOSB), Small Disadvantaged Business, or Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Small Business<br />d. Small Business Graduation Date, Company Size, and average annual revenue<br />e. List any multiple contracts that your company holds<br />f. Point of Contact for questions and/or clarifications to include telephone numbers and E-mail address</p>

All responses should be sent to the Contract Negotiator, Laura Caravantes at laura.caravantes@us.af.mil, 937-257-2607, and the Contracting Officer, Barbara Phillips at barbara.phillips.4@us.af.mil, 937-257-5240, by 11 May 2016, 4:00 P.M. EST.</p>
<p>An Industry Day is planned for Tuesday, 24 May 2016, at 9:00 A. M. Eastern Standard Time (EST). The location for Industry Day will be at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) United Services Organization (USO) Center, 2221 Birch Street, Building 1222, WPAFB, Ohio 45433. The Industry Day will include the opportunity for one-on-one sessions. There is an Industry Day Post, Attachment 4, which provides the details and instructions for participating. There is a registration Form, Attachment 5, which will need to be submitted. The form needs to be filled out completely to include the block stating the request for a one-on-one session. The CON-IT Quad Chart and Executive Summary is also required to be submitted in order to attend Industry Day. All responses should include the Quad Chart, Executive Summary, and the Industry Day Registration Form which includes the request for a one-on-one session. All responses should be sent to the Contract Negotiator, Laura Caravantes at laura.caravantes@us.af.mil and the Contracting Officer, Barbara Phillips at barbara.phillips.4@us.af.mil by 11 May 2016, 4:00 P.M.

<p>There is a What's New document which will provide a running log of what is placed on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) concerning the CON-IT development acquisition. We'll not only identify the item(s) posted but also what has changed, as applicable. The latest posting will be on the top. If there are any questions related to the What's New document they should be addressed to our Contract Negotiator, Laura Caravantes, laura.caravantes@us.af.mil or to the Contracting Officer, Barbara Phillips, barbara.phillips.4@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) as defined and discussed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest, is a concern in all acquisitions across the Department of Defense (DoD). Early involvement with our industry partners is a key element of the OCI process, and it is critical for the Government to be able to identify any potential OCI issues as early as possible for an acquisition. This would allow ample time to address and evaluate any potential OCI issues, if required, prior to any possible contract award with minimal impact to critical acquisition schedules.</p>
<p>Interested vendors are requested to evaluate their potential OCI issues with regard to this requirement and identify those issues to the Contracting Officer (CO) in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.5. This will assist the CO in determining if the vendor will need to submit an OCI Mitigation Plan for any solicitation that might result from this notice.</p>
<p>The AFLCMC Ombudsman hears concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, communicates those concerns from industry or Government personnel to AFLCMC/CC, and assists in the resolution of those concerns. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes, nor does the Ombudsman diminish the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution. When approached with an issue or query the Ombudsman independently assesses the situation and provides a response or initiates a resolution, and when requested, will maintain confidentiality as to the source of the inquiry. Contact information for the AFLCMC-Wright Patterson AFB Ombudsman is as follows:</p>
<p>Name: Lt Col Kenneth L. Decker, Jr. <br />Address: AFLCMC/AQ-AZ<br />1790 10th Street, Bldg 572<br />WPAFB, OH 45433<br />COMM: 937-255-5512<br />DSN: 785-5512<br />Email: kenneth.decker.1@us.af.mil</p>

<DESC>The National Assessment Group (NAG) has a mission to conduct rapid assessments for the Department of Defense and other government agencies. The contractor shall provide the NAG with professional, non-personal services (as defined in FAR 37.101) related to planning, execution, reporting of NAG assessments; institutional support; and incidental tasks as described with specificity in individual task orders.
<p>The goal of each NAG assessment is to meet the information needs of the NAG client. NAG clients include the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and other Joint organizations, the individual Services, and other federal government agencies. Many of these clients represent programs that are smaller than major defense acquisition programs. They require independent assessment services, to support programmatic decisions on accelerated schedules. NAG assessments cover a variety of areas and systems. Each assessment is tailored to meet client needs. Many projects consist of independent, rapid assessments to research, demonstrate, and evaluate system capabilities, technical parameters, threats and vulnerabilities. The systems assessed can vary from those in the initial stages of development to those ready for operational deployment. In the past five years, the NAG conducted approximately 50 assessment projects per year and published an average of 90 assessment reports of various types per year. As NAG projects can have extremely high visibility in the DoD, it is imperative that the NAG reports are written in a manner suitable for senior executives and general officers.</p>

No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 5:30 PM ET on April 26, 2016.  Responses must be submitted in writing to Robert.Mohn@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received.

<DESC>Agency: Department of the Army&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 April 2016<br />Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Location: USACE Middle East District
<p>Solicitation Number: W912ER-16-R-0023<br />Notice Type: Sources Sought<br />Synopsis:</p>
<p>1. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal. This request does not obligate the Government in any contract award. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Transatlantic Middle East District (TAM) is conducting preliminary research to determine the market capabilities (of both large and small firms) to provide Architectural and Engineering (A-E) Services in support of the USACE performing engineering and oversight of foundation grouting, bottom outlet repair and design, and cost plus contract oversight at Mosul Dam in Iraq.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to perform market research in order to determine if any A-E firms are capable and willing to perform work in the proposed area of responsibility. In accordance with standard Department of State guidance regarding Iraq, the contractor would not be provided Privileges and Immunity for its staff. Contractor may receive partial indemnification for any failure of or at Mosul Dam. A Forward Operation Base would be established at the Dam by the Government of Italy and an Italian force would provide protection at the site. Contractor could expect office space, vehicles to use, housing, ablution, food, water, Role 1 medical, and 230V/50Hz power at the site.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION AND WORK: The project work site is located on the Tigris River 60 km northwest of Mosul, Iraq. Mosul Dam was designed as a multi-purpose dam providing water supply, irrigation, flood control, and power generation. Main features include an embankment dam (113 m high and 2.21 km long); a service spillway (five 13.3 m wide x 13.5 m high hydraulically-operated radial gates, capable of discharging 13,000 m3/s with the reservoir elevation at 338 meters above sea level; a hydropower facility (total rated capacity of 750 MW; four power penstocks with total discharge capacity of each penstock tunnel of 280 m3/s); a bottom outlet structure (two 12-m diameter concrete conduits transitioning to two 10-m diameter tunnels with a maximum discharge capacity of 2435 m3/s); a saddle dam (1.2 km long); and an emergency spillway with fuse plug (400 m long).</p>
<p>From 1985 onward, the Mosul dam has been continuously grouted to plug seepage caused by eroding gypsum karst areas under and around the dam structure. As a result of combatant activities in northern Iraq in 2014, continuous grouting operations ceased for an extended period of time. This cessation of grouting and the natural rates of erosion have led to critical levels of erosion in the foundation. The USACE estimates that, in the last year, 5000 cubic meters of foundation material were lost due to erosion. This equates to a daily loss of approximately 15 cubic meters per day.</p>
<p>On March 2nd, 2016, the Government of Iraq (GoI) signed construction contract documents with Trevi S.p.A. (hereafter referred to as "Trevi") to pursue emergency grouting and reconstruct the bottom outlet works. The contract between the GoI and Trevi references a legal entity named "The Engineer", which for the purposes of this A-E contract is the "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers" (USACE), subject to an official agreement between the GoI and the United States Government. In order for the USACE to perform the function of "The Engineer" to the maximum extent practical, we require the professional services of an Architectural and Engineering firm (A-E) to augment our professional staff.</p>
<p>The firm, in support of TAM, shall perform geotechnical oversight, materials testing and reporting, design, and other Architectural and Engineering services to include quality assurance, technical, and administrative assistance for high volume grouting, maintenance grouting, and repair of the bottom outlet. Efforts under this task order are to a) review grouting activities, b) review grouting success and revise grout mix designs, c) advise on grouting procedures and locations, d) assess the condition of the grouting gallery and the dam's bottom outlet concrete and mechanical/electrical structures associated therewith, e) provide repair alternatives, f) monitor construction activities, and g) perform QA testing on behalf of USACE during foundation grouting and repair of the bottom outlets. The grouting and bottom outlet repair contract has been awarded to Trevi under a cost plus fee agreement. Operations would be 24/7/365 during the performance of the work.</p>
<p>Primary tasks under the requirements include but not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Acquire, compile, catalog, and index all available historic records and construction photographs available regarding the project such as the original design plans and specifications, geotechnical records, and geotechnical and surveys performed as remedial grouting was emplaced since original project impoundment engineering during construction records, as-builts, and commissioning records <br /><br />b. Set up and maintain a SharePoint server allowing all site and historical data to be available to the A-E, the USACE, and others designated by the USACE. Note, this is not intended to substitute for RMS.<br /><br />c. Perform Quality Assurance for geotechnical investigations and foundation grouting,<br /><br />d. Perform grouting analysis and design mixes for the USACE to require for use,<br /><br />e. Test grout and concrete materials to ensure they meet standards and design specifications in Trevi contract,<br /><br />f.

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a family of imide materials that exhibit glass transition temperatures from 240C to 340C. Two resins from this family, designated as PETI-RTM and PETI-RI, were originally developed to meet the demanding requirements for future high-speed aircraft. These materials allow the manufacture of complex composite parts with excellent mechanical properties, including high toughness and long-term thermal oxidative stability. These resins have been engineered to exhibit low process viscosities to enable parts fabrication via resin transfer molding (RTM) and resin infusion (RI). Composites fabricated using these resins provide mechanical properties comparable to bismaleimide-based composites while exhibiting superior temperature performance. Low-weight composites based upon these PETI resins could replace some titanium and aluminum alloy parts currently used in aerospace structures and engines. As manufacturing technologies, RTM and RI offer lower cost, better dimensional stability, and other improved features over the use of traditional prepreg processes. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. US Patent 6,359,107.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a method and system for detecting defects in a material by mixing waves of known frequencies at an interaction zone in the material. This method and system provides a defect detection capability that will allow structures to be repaired or taken out of service before cracks can develop. A structure can be scanned in situ and need not be under stress for accurate measurement. The invention is well suited to be used as part of a preventive maintenance program for a variety of material, vehicle and/or structural applications. The NASA method and system for detects defects in a material by mixing waves of known frequencies at an interaction zone in the material. As a result, at least one of a difference wave and a sum wave are generated in the interaction zone. The difference wave occurs at a difference frequency and the sum wave occurs at a sum frequency. The amplitude of at least one nonlinear signal based on the sum and/or difference waves is then measured. The nonlinear signal is defined as the amplitude of one of the difference wave and sum wave relative to the product of the amplitude of the surface waves. The amplitude of the nonlinear signal is an indication of defects (e.g., dislocation dipole density) in the interaction zone.&nbsp; This highly accurate, in situ method enables earlier detection of fatigue failures. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. US Patent 5,736,642.</p>

The cited authority for this action is 10 U.S.C.&sect; 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. (FAR 6.302-1/DFARS 206.302-1.)</p>
<p>A.	Description of Action:<br />Contract action is the award of a one-time contract vehicle to Expression Networks LLC, using a firm-fixed price contract. This requirement is for Joint Spectrum Data Repository (JSDR) and Integrated Spectrum Desktop (ISD) Supplemental Development and Sustainment Tasking of which Expression Networks LLC is the only responsible source (who can provide  successful configuration and implementation of the Joint Spectrum Data Repository version 2 (JSDRv2)).</p>
<p>B.	Description of Supplies/Services:<br />The contract supplements the tasking being performed through the ongoing development contract for Joint Spectrum Data Repository (JSDR) and Integrated Spectrum Desktop (ISD) Supplemental Development and Sustainment Tasking related to the ongoing GEMSIS effort.</p>
<p>C.	Contractor's Unique Capabilities/Qualifications:<br />There is only one source capable of providing the support required to establish the necessary expertise on the JSDRv2 architecture, the spectrum data, and data exchange standard that would be required to keep the program on time and within acceptable cost parameters. This new JSDRv2 has been incorporated into the GEMSIS ACAT III program of record, which is approaching the Increment 2 Block 3 Milestone C with Full Operational Capability (FOC) to be achieved by 4Q 2017. Due to the time and cost constraints of completing GEMSIS Increment 2 Full Operational Capability (FOC), it is imperative to acquire as an interim measure, supplemental developmental and sustainment tasking to the ongoing JSDRv2 rapid development effort to allow for completion of new items that have been identified to be necessary to prepare the JSDR program for sustainment. This will allow GEMSIS to meet other Increment 2 Key System Attributes (KSAs) within the Increment 2 timeframe that have not been able to be successfully addressed through other efforts.</p>
<p>In accordance with the aforementioned, Expression Networks LLC has been identified as the only responsible source of satisfying this requirement. DISA-NCR intends to award on a sole source basis by 13 May 2016, for a Base + One (1) Option Year.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This NoI is not a request for quote or proposal. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government.

The combined length of the pier and dolphins are estimated to be 868 linear feet. Project includes the installation of a 10-inch carbon steel pipeline, two fuel loading arms, spill containment, and storm water management systems; demolition of the existing fuel pier (estimated age 50+ years) and ground fueling station and dredging work for a turning basin in association with the fuel pier. An estimated 45,000 cubic yards of dredged material may require removal. The area has not been dredged previously. Sediment testing has been performed and the dredge material is suitable for ocean disposal at the Norfolk Ocean Disposal Site (NODS), approximately 37 miles from the project location. This requirement includes components of Gas Pipeline installation and Related Structures Construction and Dredging.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: The period of performance will be 36 months from Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project.<br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described LHCC? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the LHCC project?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?</p>
<p>d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles of LHCC) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements?</p>
<p>g. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc..</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your responses to these questions and any comments via e-mail to Ms. Elandria M. Cameron, Contract Specialist, at elandria.m.cameron@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 25 April 2016.</p>

The NAICS Code is 325120 with a size standard of 1000 employees. Defense Microelectronic Activity (DMEA) anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. DMEA intends to issue a fixed-price, sole source contract to Linde LLC to provide continuous uninterrupted Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) for operational processes to the Linde LLC owned onsite storage tanks. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304 (C) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501(a)(1)(ii) and 13.501(a)(2)(ii). All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the agency. All submissions must be received prior to 25 April 2016. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Additionally the contractor shall perform an annual delivered gas quality analysis (at the output of the system N2 gas header) and provide the analysis report to the DMEA Technical Point of Contact demonstrating that the gas meets the SEMI standard. Quality analysis shall be performed on the nitrogen system annually.</p>
<p>Maintenance Support: The contractor shall maintain the complete nitrogen system up to and including the header to include all required maintenance, filters, calibration, inspections and replacement. Maintenance/replacement/calibration/inspections shall be conducted so as not to interrupt DMEA's LN2 delivery to the required facilities.

Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Disposable Underpads. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MW-1409-23_Disposable_Underpads are eligible for participation. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong><br />These Disposable Underpads products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil/">https://www.medical.dla.mil/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the subject QSL. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is May 2016. Among vendors who are on the subject QSL, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA. </strong>The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Disposable Underpads.&nbsp; <br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Underpads. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $1,860,590.00 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the subject QSL who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Pacific via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM&nbsp;Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong><br />1. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Required Products / Annual Usage in Units /</strong><br />1. UNDERPAD, DISPOSABLE SUPER ABSORBENCY POLYMER CELLULOSE CORE WITH POLYPROPYLENE BACKING 17"-25"X23"-36" / 889962 /<br />2. UNDERPAD, DISPOSABLE MODERATE ABSORBENCY POLYPROPYLENE BACKING 17"-25"X23"-36" / <br />3161300 /<br />3. UNDERPAD, DISPOSABLE SUPER ABSORBENCY POLYMER CELLULOSE CORE WITH POLYPROPYLENE BACKING 30"-36"X34"-36" / <br />320512 /&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />4. UNDERPAD, DISPOSABLE LIGHT ABSORBENCY FLUFF FILLED, POLYPROPYLENE BACKING 17"-23"X23"-24" / 1887334 /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />2. Vendor may provide any or all of the additional items listed below, following the same format as for requirement number 1. Pricing for these additional items will not be part of the pricing computation for vendor selection. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><strong><br />Item Descriptions /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong>1. UNDERPAD, DISPOSABLE MODERATE ABSORBENCY POLYMER CELLULOSE CORE 23"-32"X30"-36" /<br />2. UNDERPAD, DISPOSABLE HEAVY ABSORBENCY POLYMER CELLULOSE CORE 17"-19"X23"-25" /<br />3. UNDERPAD, DISPOSABLE HEAVY ABSORBENCY POLYMER CELLULOSE CORE 23"-25"X3"4-36" /<br />4.

UNDERPAD, DISPOSABLE SUPER ABSORBENCY POLYMER CELLULOSE CORE 27"-36"X70" /<br />7. UNDERPAD, DISPOSABLE LIGHT ABSORBENCY, POLYPROPYLENE 27"-30"X30"-32" /<br />8. UNDERPAD, DISPOSABLE MODERATE ABSORBENCY POLYMER CELLULOSE CORE 27"-36"X70" /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />3. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />Mr. Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.u.orias.ctr@mail.mil, (619) 532-8537; Ms. Cheryl Janus, RN, MSN, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, cheryl.a.janus.ctr@mail.mil, (619) 532-7554; DLA Troop Support Medical Contracting Officer: Tara J.

The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items.<br /><br />The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-16-307 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). <br /> <strong><br />NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</strong><br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 334516 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees. <br /> <strong><br />SET-ASIDE STATUS</strong><br />This acquisition is unrestricted. Businesses of any size classification may respond.
<p><strong><br />ACQUISITION AUTHORITY </strong><br />This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and IS expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. <br /> <br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-87-2, dated April 6, 2016. The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through this date. <br /><strong><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />A major part of the research activities within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Division of Intramural Research (DIR) focuses on clinical nuerocardiology. The Clinical Neurocardiology Section (CNCS) studies biomarkers, mechanisms, and potential treatment of catecholamine depletion in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. Approved, active clinical research protocols of the CNCS all require autonomic function testing. For instance, CNCS's study on biomarkers of risk of PD focuses on whether people who have statistical risk factors for PD have objective evidence-"biomarkers"-that the disease process is actually going on and if so whether people who have abnormal "biomarkers" actually develop PD during several years of follow-up. <br /><br />One of the key types of biomarkers under study is the sympathetic noradrenergic component of the autonomic nervous system, which is assessed physiologically by monitoring beat-to-beat blood pressure non-invasively by an automated finger cuff device. CNCS requires a finger cuff blood pressure recording system to replace the existing system.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose</strong><br />The purpose of this requirement is acquisition of one (1) finger cuff blood pressure recording system that will be used to continuously monitor and non-invasively record blood pressure and related cardiovascular variables for clinical research study patients.<br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements</strong></p>

<DESC>This combined synopsis solicitation is being issued solely to renumber Solicitation N00189-14-R-Z090 previously synopsized on 26 August 2014 and to officially post this renumbered Solicitation as N00189-15-R-Z064, effective 03 June 2015. 

The pre-solicitation synopsis notice dated 26 August 2014 stated as follows: The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk intends to acquire operation and maintenance services for the Forces Surveillance Support Center (FSSC) Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar (ROTHR) system. The ROTHR System is a very unique radar system that uses high-frequency (HF) over-the-horizon (OTH) radar to track and detect drug trafficking activities in Northern South American and Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico basins.
 It is used by the Navy, North American Defense (NORAD), Customs, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and other national security agencies for Homeland Security, Counter-Narcoterrorism and Anti-Terrorism activities. The system consists of an Operations Control Center (OCC), three land-based, bi-static, high frequency, Doppler radar sites consisting of transmit and receive sites, and support facilities. The three ROTHR systems are located in Virginia, Texas, and Puerto Rico. The operation and maintenance (O and M) services are required 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year. The requirement presents several challenges to the Contractor including having to work with a mature system, dealing with parts obsolescence, and the Government does not possess the Level III technical data associated with this unique legacy system.
 

The placement of a combined Firm Fixed Priced and Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Performance-Based type contract is anticipated. The period of performance will be for a 12 month base period plus four one-year options beginning on 1 August 2015. The applicable NAICS code is 541990 and the FSC is M1BC. The solicitation is anticipated to be posted to Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) https://www.neco.navy.mil under solicitation N00189-14-R-Z090. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit on an unrestricted basis. The Small Business office has reviewed the market research and concurs with the acquisition strategy identified herein. Questions concerning this requirement should be submitted only after reading the entire solicitation which includes the detailed requirements.
 Please direct any questions to Lauren Lauver at Lauren.lauver@navy.mil.

All of the above terms and conditions of the initial synopsis notice remain unchanged with the exception of:  (1) renumbering of the solicitation from N00189-14-R-Z090 to N00189-15-R-Z064, and (2) updating of the NFLC Norfolk Phila Site Point of contact to Mary Mezzatesta who can be reached at 215-697-9691; mary.mezzatesta@navy.mil.

Introduction:  The primary purpose of this position is to provide leadership, guidance, and overall direction to USAID/Uganda's Organizational Development and Learning efforts, including strengthened monitoring and evaluation.  B. MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES (1) Develop, Manage and Coordinate Program Learning Opportunities (35%) Plan, establish, and direct a wide range of organizational interventions (special studies, after action reviews, Partners meetings, organizational learning surveys, on-line engagements) for advancing USAID's Collaborating, Learning and Adapting component to facilitate overall CDCS implementation. Develop guidance and make contributions towards: --Language for funding agreements that emphasizes collaborating, learning and adapting. --Development of "influence plans" as part of project design to leverage the resources and actions of other development actors. --Implementation of the learning aspects of new Program Cycle guidance (CDCS, project design, program performance management, M&amp;E). --Implementation of the forthcoming Agency Knowledge Management (KM)/Learning Strategy. --Improved M&amp;E approaches to track results at IR and presidential initiative levels and to supplement common and established key indicators with outcome mapping and other approaches that support continuous review and iterative course correction/adaptation. Coordinate with key Program Office, M&amp;E, and GIS staff to provide guidance to USAID technical teams on research design and methodologies, applied research studies, impact assessment, evaluation, knowledge capture and sharing, stakeholder engagement, and application of learning to program and project design and management. Work closely with Program Development Officer and technical teams to articulate development hypotheses, plan for testing those hypotheses, and contribute to advancing USAID's Project Design Guidance.  Based on implementation results, new learning and stakeholder feedback, work across Mission with Program Office and Technical teams to guide iterative course corrections and ensure ongoing and evolving alignment of portfolio with strategy. Refine and implement the Mission's learning agenda and CLA strategy, including developing and managing a CLA budget as articulated in the CDCS. Provide valuable learning leadership to USAID staff, implementing partners and other stakeholders.  Ensure that USAID is learning from implementation of District Operational Plans.  Identify ways to reduce knowledge sharing barriers, e.g. through application of e-sharing and learning tools, creation of Communities of Practice and USAID's Council of Advisors, re-orientation of key staff's current orientation to program management, more peer and cross-learning and other contemporary, effective learning techniques and opportunities. Oversee identification and implementation of opportunities to link USAID's contributions to Uganda's development to the activities of other bilateral and multilateral donors, private sector and non-government organizations, and government counterparts and civil society actors. Seek opportunities to advance USAID knowledge management and learning activities to ensure rapid, effective sharing and application of learning in topics of keen interest to USAID/Uganda (i.e. methods for realizing effective local governance, increasing women's influence in households, nutrition and agriculture,  private-sector led approaches to social services and development).  Track developments in evolving KM and adult learning fields to incorporate promising practice and new or improved learning tools and approaches into CLA program. (2) Stakeholder Engagement, Communication and Information Dissemination (35%): Improve outreach to and reception by USAID technical teams, implementing partners, civil society, academic and research institutions, other donor agencies, and GOU. Establish professional relations with key, in-country development &lsquo;savants' who can serve as KM and organizational learning advisors to learn from USAID's execution of the CDCS. Ensure activity design and program development documents engage a wide range of stakeholders, facilitate strategic collaboration and knowledge exchange, and promote learning opportunities that improve USAID's understanding of the Ugandan development context and thus more purposeful application of experiential, codified learning to strengthen USAID's development interventions. Develop guidance, processes and practices to support USAID staff in engaging with implementing partners and other stakeholders collaboratively as knowledge peers. (3) Research Design and Analysis (30%) Conceive, plan, and conduct pioneering analyses, evaluations, or investigations/after action reviews in program areas of key learning importance to USAID.  Foster relations with Makerere Institute of Social Research as well as other Ugandan institutions and intellectuals to have them assist on and periodically participate in such studies or serve as participants in "Big Picture" and other reflective exercises.

<p>SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES (SAP)<br />Brand Name/Specific Justification<br />SOLICITATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO ONE SOURCE ONLY IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT ONLY ONE SOURCE IS REASONABLY AVAILABLE. THIS DETERMINATION MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH FULL JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE FROM THE CUSTOMER. WHEN THE CUSTOMER DESCRIBES AN ITEM WITH A PURCHASE DESCRIPTION WHICH LIMITS THE AVAILABILITY TO ONE SOURCE, THE JUSTIFICATION MUST EXPLAIN WHY THE ITEM IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL MEET THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUIREMENT. STATEMENTS SUCH AS "ONLY KNOWN SOURCE" OR "ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN MEET THE REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE" ARE INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE. THE CUSTOMER SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:<br />PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER<br />21-16-446PC8104 PROJECT/TASK NUMBER<br />REPFDVS42 ESTIMATED AMOUNT (Over Micro-Purchase Threshold, but up to the Simplified Acquisition Threshold) $ 12,000.00<br />BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED, AND THE INTENDED USE<br />2 EA of: HITACHI 1/" Format EM -CCD Hi-Sensitivity Day/Night Camera, Part #: KP-DE500-S5. And 2 EA of: THEIA - 1.8-3.0mm Varifocal Megapixel Lens Day/Night DC Auto Iris CS-Mount Part#: SL183A. The HITACHI Camera and the THEIA Lens make up the Fixed Wide Angle Closed Circuit Camera used on Coast Guard Cutters. The fixed Camera provides for critical flight deck safety allowing the helicopter control officer (HCO) the ability to view flight deck operations from Cutters Pilothouse.</p>
<p><br />UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE BRAND NAME, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER BRAND NAMES OR SOURCES CAN BE USED. <br />Procurement of Hitachi Brand Name Camera and the Theia Lenses is required to maintain standardization within the CG Cutter Fleet. The Hitachi Cameras require very specific wiring that is integrated within the Cutters. The Theia Lenses are the lenses that are compatible with the Hitachi Camera for this Specific Application. Use of other models or brands will require re-engineering the Flight Deck Video System(FDVS) installation, replacement of mating hardware, cabling, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>REASON THAT SUGGESTED BRAND NAME IS THE ONLY BRAND NAME WHICH CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>All applicable installations of the FDVS are designed and installed for compatibility with the Hitachi fixed camera w/the Thiea Lenses. 36 of 45 planned systems have been procured and installed. Changing equipment models brands at this point will result in unnecessary and avoidable cost.<br />EXPLAIN WHY AN ADEQUATE PURCHASE DESCRIPTION OR OTHER INFORMATION SUITABLE TO SOLICIT BY FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE.<br />The bulk of prior purchases were made under a contract to deliver turnkey systems installed on the cutters. Equipment was originally selected by the contractor based on Coast Guard operational requirements. The overall system is composed of COTS, modified COTS and end items fabricated by the contractor. The items included in this procurement are parts used to fabricate the final end-item (fixed camera). These parts are available from multiple sources however the specific model is requested to maintain interoperability and compatibility with existing shipboard power systems, wiring and control. <br />PROVIDE A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE REQUIRED<br />None at this time. This Project is nearing completion. It is estimated that the next generation of FDVS cameras will be developed beginning in 2020-2021.<br />SIGNATURE AND TITLE OF CUSTOMER<br />Charles L.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Security Specialist will work with the Adjudications Team, within the Personnel Security Division, Office of Security (SEC). This individual will develop policies, criteria, and procedures for USAID regarding the scope and conduct of personnel security investigations.  The incumbent provides support and guidance in all areas of personnel security to ensure timely processing of cases, and customer service at an extremely high level. This individual will serve as a liaison between OTI, FFP and SEC offices to ensure effective and efficient communication relative to existing and emerging priorities for OTI and FFP.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Office of the Associate Director for Science (OADS) issues this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Fiscal Year 2016 under the provisions of FAR 35.016 and FAR 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contracts that are awarded based on responses to this BAA are as a result of full and open competition and therefore in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."</p>
<p>CDC contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, state and local government, and private industry for research and development (R&amp;D) in those areas covered in Part II of this BAA. The government reserves the right to make multiple awards under this announcement.</p>
<p>This BAA establishes a four-step process for offerors contemplating submission of a proposal under this BAA. This sequence allows for an early determination of the potential for interest based on technical merit, applicability to CDC and projected funding. This process is designed to limit offeror and Government expenditure of effort to prepare and review formal proposals for research that may have little chance of being supported.</p>
<p>Funding of research within CDC will be determined by funding availability and the following broad research priorities:</p>
<p>1. Microbiome assessment and intervention to address antibiotic resistance<br />2. Understanding and prevention of antibiotic-resistant organism transmission and emergence <br />3. Enhanced understanding of medication safety threats<br />4. Evaluate the capacity for tracking and preventing antibiotic-resistance threats in non-acute care settings<br />5. Improve timeliness, accuracy and usability of public health surveillance and survey data<br />6. Integration of epidemiologic and genomics data</p>
<p>Interest/eligible applicants are instructed to seek further information in the full BAA included in this posting.</p>
<p>For parties with further questions about the above research priorities, two webinars will be held to answer questions. Dates, times, and topics of each are included in the attached documents.</p>
<p>These webinars may be viewed using Skype for Business using the following link: https://webconf.cdc.gov/lzk6/592V9M6Z</p>

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. <BR> <BR>(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

<DESC><strong>Automated Flight Following Hardware and Subscription Service</strong>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>Solicitation number AG-024B-S-16-0019 is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) by the Forest Service Incident Support Branch AQM located at 3833 S Development Ave Boise ID, 83705. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-83 August 3, 2015. This acquisition is a Total Small Business Set Aside under the NAICS code 334220, and PSC code 5895 with a small business size standard of 750 employees. All offerors must ensure that they complete the required submission of FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (March 2016) indicating size status in accordance with the applicable set aside of this acquisition.</p>
<p>The resultant award will be a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for the required supplies and service with one (1) base period and four (4) option periods. The minimum contract guarantee is $10,000 and maximum order amount is $900,000. Award will be made to the contractor whose proposal provides the best value to the Government. Due to the fact that the Government is seeking a vendor who can provide the technical hardware, subscriptions services, and experience/expertise most directly related to the Statement of Work (SOW), the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offer if the Government determines that the additional cost is justified in return for the perceived benefits set forth in the contractor's technical proposal. The Source Selection Authority (SSA) will perform an integrated best value assessment of the evaluated offerors and document the merits of the trade-off in price and that the price is fair and reasonable. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Proposals will be priced only on the following Contract Line Items structure. Any proposal that does not provide pricing according to the outlined structure will be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submission Requirements</span><br /><br />1. Complete Technical Proposal addressing all minimum requirements of SOW and clearly identifying which if any target features are included. Technical Proposals shall be limited to no more than 16 pages.<br /><br />2.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provisions and Clauses<br /></span><br />FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers (Oct 2015) - Commercial applies to this acquisition and there are no addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014) is applicable to this acquisition as follows;</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />Technical capability and past performance, when combined, is equally as important as price. The non-price factors are all of equal value to each other.<br />The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal that includes any assumptions that adversely impacts the Government's requirements. <br /><br />(i) FACTOR 1 - Technical Capability<br />The offers will be evaluated on overall technical capability, which is the ability to meet the minimum requirements outlined in the SOW, the ability and special features of the proposed hardware and its relevance to the wildland fire mission, as well as the following factors:<br />(a) The Government's technical evaluation board shall evaluate the technical proposals to ensure they meet all SOW minimum technical requirements/specifications. Value/merit will be assigned based upon which if any target features are included in the proposal and the perceived benefit of each target feature to the intended use of the hardware and service.<br />(b) The Government will assess the perceived level of effort required in the installation process of proposed hardware. Value/merit will be assigned based upon the complexity and resultant cost of hardware installation to the Government. <br />(c) For the purpose of evaluation the Offeror must submit technical documentation for hardware and service being proposed. Technical proposal shall clearly identify characteristics that fulfill the minimum requirements in the SOW. Proposal shall clearly identify which if any of the target features identified in the SOW the hardware and service satisfy.</p>
<p>(ii) FACTOR 2 - Price<br />Each price proposed shall be evaluated to determine its reasonableness for the effort proposed and to determine the demonstrated understanding of the level of effort needed to successfully perform the requirements of the SOW. Award may not necessarily be made to the offeror submitting the lowest priced offer. The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or sub line items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest of the Government. Additional factors for evaluation include:<br />(a) The Government will evaluate the competitiveness, realism, and reasonableness of the pricing, including any discounts offered as a total sum of the base period and all option periods. <br />(b) The Government will evaluate the cost/benefit of obtaining certain target features (as defined in the SOW) as it relates to price and make a best value determination for award. <br />(c) For the purpose of price evaluation the Offeror must submit a completed prototypical project pricing matrix (Appendix 1).</p>
<p>(iii) FACTOR 3 - Past Performance<br />Past performance is a measure of the degree to which the offeror has previously satisfied customers in the performance of the efforts/requirements identified in the SOW. Additional factors for evaluation include: <br />(a) The Government will evaluate the relevance and recentness of past performance of the offeror and its relation to the SOW requirements. <br />(b) For the purpose of past performance evaluation the Offeror must submit completed past performance questionnaires (Appendix 2) for each performance event to be considered.</p>
<p><em>Evaluation Plan<br /></em><br />Definitions<br /><br />Deficiency: An aspect of the proposal that fails to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that raises the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. <br /><br />Recent Performance: is defined as contracts performed within the last three years. <br />Relevant Performance: Includes performance of efforts involving same type supplies and services that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in the SOW.<br /><br />Significant Strength: An outstanding or exceptional aspect of a proposal that appreciably increases the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform contract requirements.<br /><br />Significant Weakness: A proposal flaw that appreciably increases the chance of unsuccessful performance.<br /><br />Strength: A significant outstanding or exceptional aspect of a proposal that exceeds the minimum evaluation standard.<br /><br />Weakness: A flaw in the proposal that decreases the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform contract requirements.</p>
<p><br />Technical Capability<br />The government will conduct a subjective assessment of performance risk based upon the technical capabilities of the offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the SOW requirements. The Government will evaluate the proposals inclusion of target features outlined in the SOW. Technical evaluation of proposals will only include the factors and sub-factors listed above.</p>
<p>The following adjectives will be used in assessing technical capabilities:</p>
<p>TABLE 1 - TECHNICAL FACTOR EVALUATION RATINGS</p>
<p>Exceptional - Exceeds minimum technical expectations and includes a significant amount if not all identified target features and specifications. Reflects an innovative approach and/or superior understanding of the requirement in a way beneficial to the Government; proposal must have one or more strengths and no deficiencies and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Acceptable - Meets minimum technical expectations with little to no target features or specifications included. Reflects sound approach and/or satisfactory understanding of the requirement; proposal may have one or more strengths and may have a minor weakness but no deficiencies.<br /><br />Marginal - Does not clearly meet technical expectations. Reflects an uncertain approach and/or incomplete understanding of the requirement. Proposal contains multiple weaknesses but no deficiencies.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements; proposal has multiple weaknesses and one or more deficiencies. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />The Government will conduct a subjective assessment of performance risk based upon the past performance of the offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the SOW requirements. A contractor with no past performance to evaluate will be given a neutral rating (Unknown Confidence) IAW FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv). The Government reserves the right to obtain information from sources other than the sources identified by the Offeror (e.g., CPARS, PPIRS) and such information will be used for performance risk assessment, responsibility determination, and best value decision. The Government may consider positive and negative information not mentioned by the Offeror, but found during the course of assessing relevant Past Performance.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Past Performance will use the following adjectival ratings to assess confidence:</p>
<p>TABLE 2- PAST PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS</p>
<p>Substantial Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Limited Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>No Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br /><br />Unknown Confidence - No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br /><br />Basis for Award<br />The Government will award the contract to the Offeror that has (1) submitted all of the materials and information required by the RFP, and otherwise has complied with the RFP instructions, and (2) has the best combination of technical capability, past performance, and price that is most advantageous to the Government.<br />The Government reserves the right to make price/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest of the Government. The Offeror whose price/technical relationship is the most advantageous to the Government will be selected for award amongst all the Offerors. Award may be made without further discussions. Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a technical and price standpoint, which the Offeror can submit to the Government. However, the Government may, after evaluation of proposals, conduct further oral or written discussions as appropriate with all Offerors in the competitive range. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. For evaluation of FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (NOV 1999) the Government will take the sum total of the base period and the four (4) option periods divided by five (5).

The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>

<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to CHAD.E.GINTER@USCG.MIL. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of proposals. Vendors are required to have an active registration in WWW.SAM.GOV</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers #3 - RFP # LCFLD16RFP002 - SMIV <br />Digitization and Digital Archiving of Books
<p><br />PLEASE NOTE:<br />1. The deadline for submitting a quotation is 5:00 pm Friday, April 15, 2016. <br />2. Offerors MUST submit response package to vfox@loc.gov AND to flicc-cl@loc.gov.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p>
<p>Q.20. Locations. Section C.5.1. Locations: Scanning activities shall be conducted on site at Customer locations (the Smithsonian Libraries and one or more BHL consortium sites), and at one or more Contractor-operated locations.</p>
<p>Does this mean we need to consider that digitization activities could be performed at several locations? If yes, can you describe the expected locations and number of books involved.</p>
<p>A.20. For Contractor-operated facilities: At a minimum, the Contractor needs to provide one scanning operation in London, United Kingdom, and one other operation in the United States. <br />For Customer-operated facilities with Contractor-supplied equipment: There is a location at the Smithsonian Libraries and up to two other locations in the United States - one in the Northeast, and one in the Midwest or Mid-Atlantic region. The number of books for the Contractor location in London is estimated at 200. See Section B for quantities of books for Customer locations.</p>
<p>Partnerships and subcontractors are not precluded if sufficient information about the partner/subcontractor, as well as a plan for managing the work and quality assurance of the partner/subcontractor, is provided in the offeror's proposal.</p>
<p>Q.21. Digitization set-up. Concerning providing our digitization set-up for performing this project: is a particular type of V-Shape set-up expected? If yes, can fold-out material be digitized using other equipment?</p>
<p>A.21. The offeror should propose the equipment he determines is the best solution to perform non-destructive scanning of bound materials, delivering the images at the required quality level. Multiple scanners for different purposes may be proposed, for example, for bound volumes and foldout pages.</p>

<DESC>Under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) is developing and leading the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) Project, which will provide infrastructure necessary to enable a world-class international program in neutrino physics. Specifically, the LBNF Project plans to build a new high-intensity neutrino beam at Fermilab aimed at large liquid argon-based neutrino detectors planned to be located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, SD. In support of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), the LBNF Project will construct Conventional Facilities (CF) on the surface and a mile deep underground on the 4850-foot level at SURF that provide infrastructure needed to support the neutrino detectors.<br /><br />To construct LBNF facilities at SURF, Fermilab intends to procure a Construction Manager/General Contractor (CM/GC) through a competitive, best value procurement. The LBNF CM/GC work will be structured in distinct phases: <br /><br />- <strong>Base Subcontract</strong>: includes preconstruction construction management services;<br />- <strong>Options 1A and 1B</strong>: includes CM/GC Services and execution of the construction of the CF at SURF;<br />- <strong>Option 2</strong>: construction management and logistics coordination only of the cryogenic infrastructure systems and detectors to be installed at SURF through separate contacts held by Fermilab and its partners.<br /><br />During Base Subcontract, the CM/GC will provide support services to LBNF and its existing architecture and engineering team including recommendations on selection of materials, building systems and equipment, construction feasibility, logistics management, value engineering, and factors related to construction, plus cost estimates and schedules, including estimates of alternative designs or materials. The CM/GC will also provide recommendations for actions designed to minimize adverse effects of labor or material shortages, time requirements for procurement and installation and construction completion. Design (for facility or experiment) is not within the CM/GC scope.<br /><br />During Options 1A and 1B, the CM/GC will manage and execute underground excavation, excavated rock removal, and all infrastructure and utilities to support the experiment such as power, communications and controls, HVAC, plumbing, and surface facilities to house cryogenic equipment and support DUNE personnel. <br /><strong><br />Draft Plans and Specifications:</strong><br />In order to facilitate early planning and allow the potential offeror's to become familiar with the project prior to the release of the Request for Proposal (RFP), Fermilab is providing the draft design document plans and specifications. <br /><br />This documentation is provided for information only. Questions and comments will be accepted in order to help Fermilab finalize the RFP documents and understand any industry concerns but no responses will be provided.<br /><br />The purpose of releasing the draft design documents is to allow potential offerors to become more familiar with the scope of the project and facilitate early planning in areas such as potential joint venture partnerships, personnel skill and capability requirements, estimating and marketing resource allocation, etc.<br /><strong><br />Schedule:</strong><br />LBNF currently expects to begin final design work of CF in the third quarter of calendar year 2016. The RFP is expected to be released in the second quarter of calendar year 2016 pending Department of Energy authorization. Award of the Base Subcontract is expected to occur in the second half of calendar year 2016 with preconstruction activities starting immediately. Construction activities at SURF through the CM/GC contract are expected to begin by late 2017.<br /><strong><br />Basis for Award:</strong><br />CM/GC proposing firms / teams will need to demonstrate extensive experience in heavy civil underground construction and have the capacity, expertise, and experience to successfully deliver the LBNF CF at SURF with a high degree of safety. See attachment for specific information on basis for award.<br /><strong><br />Additional Information:</strong><br />Please view the following link which provides more information on the LBNF/DUNE Project:<br />http://lbnf.fnal.gov<br />

<p>Background</p>
<p>The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), a public health regulatory agency of the U.S. Department of Agricultural (USDA), protects consumers by ensuring that meat, poultry, and egg products are safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled.&nbsp; The FSIS Technical Service Labs (TSL), located in Saint Louis MO, Athens GA, and Alameda CA, are regulatory laboratories that analyze meat, poultry and egg products to ensure they are free from adulteration.&nbsp; Antimicrobial carry-over at certain concentrations could affect pathogen survival during transport in Buffered Peptone Water (BWP).&nbsp; Based on worst case scenarios, USDA ARS was tasked with identifying neutralizing agents that were effective against certain antimicrobial interventions.&nbsp; This neutralizing buffer formulation is a result of that research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Objective/Scope</p>
<p>The FSIS Laboratories perform regulatory testing of meat, poultry and egg products for the presence of food borne pathogens such as Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and Shiga toxin producing E. coli.&nbsp; The laboratories provide BPW, a liquid collection and transport media, to FSIS Inspection Program Personnel (IPP) for sample collection and shipment to the designated TSL for analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FSIS is seeking a new formulation, hereby referred to as neutralizing Buffered Peptone Water (nBPW).&nbsp; This new media will be sent to IPP for sample collection and shipment to the designated TSL for analysis.</p>
<p>The new buffer is expected to replace all sampling applications where BPW is currently being used to collect samples for shipment to designated FSIS laboratories.&nbsp; In the last 12 months, FSIS laboratories analyzed over 14,200 samples using BPW as the collection and transport media.&nbsp; It is also expected that FSIS regulated establishments would acquire the new buffer to match FSIS sampling methods for their own sampling.</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor must provide nBPW in a final liquid form, prepared according to the specifications that follow, and in the designated aliquots.</p>
<p>The recipe for modified Buffered Peptone Water consists of:</p>
<p>Neutralizing Buffered Peptone Water (nBPW)</p>
<p>Buffered Peptone (Difco)&nbsp;20.0 g<br />refined soy lecithin (Alfa Aesar #36486, CAS 8002-43-5) or equivalent&nbsp;7 g<br />sodium thiosulfate&nbsp;2.5 g<br />MS water &nbsp;1 L<br />sodium bicarbonate&nbsp;12.5g</p>
<p>Mix Buffered peptone, soy lecithin, and sodium thiosulfate in 883 ml of water, dispense and autoclave at 121&#61616;C for 15 minutes.&nbsp; Dissolve the sodium bicarbonate in 167 ml water, filter sterilize and add to broth after the autoclaved broth cools to at least 50-55&#61616;C.</p>
<p>Before adding the sodium bicarbonate the pH is 7.0 &plusmn; 2.0.<br /><br />After the sodium bicarbonate is added the pH is 7.5 &plusmn; 2.0.&nbsp; <br /><br />Higher volumes may be made, following the same ingredient ratios specified.</p>
<p>The prepared nBPW will be provided in the following aliquots:</p>
<p>400 mL bottle<br /></p>
<p>25 mL small bottle or test tube</p>
<p>10 mL test tube</p>
<p>Deliverables</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>A&nbsp;Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) shall be included with the first shipment only.</p>
<p>A certificate of analysis shall be sent with each shipment/lot verifying pH, appearance, sterility, and recovery testing.</p>
<p>There shall be a minimum 6 month shelf life from date of receipt.</p>
<p>Each container shall be labeled with the lot number, product (i.e. nBPW), and expiration date.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements</p>
<p>Upon receipt at the laboratory, the media must pass the following criteria:</p>
<p>Appearance - clear, amber color, no cloudiness or particulates</p>
<p>pH - 7.5 &plusmn; 0.2</p>
<p>Sterility - demonstrating no growth in 24 hours at 35 &plusmn; 2&deg;C.</p>
<p>Growth challenge - demonstrating robust growth with ATCC Salmonella culture (or equivalent) incubated 24 hours at 35 &plusmn; 2&deg;C; inoculating level 20 - 50 CFU.</p>

FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting will be included in the resulting contract. This clause includes a requirement that for service contracts (except construction) at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern (prime contractor).<br />This preliminary notice is being posted to allow prospective offerors time to read through the requirement, start building their consulting team and submit early questions regarding the work outlined in this notice. This notice will be updated in the next few (2-3) weeks with a more detailed requirement including evaluation criteria, submission requirements and a due date for submission.</p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND<br />The Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area (MGRA) is located approximately twelve miles from downtown Juneau at the head of the Mendenhall Valley, the area of most rapid urban development in the City and Borough of Juneau. Use patterns within the Recreation Area are influenced by Juneau residents and out-of-town visitors.<br />The Recreation Area encompasses 5,815 acres and includes parts of McGinnis Mountain and Mt. Bullard, the terminus of the Mendenhall Glacier, Mendenhall Lake and River, and the surrounding uplands. Elevations through much of the Recreation Area are less than 100 feet above sea level. On either side, mountains rise abruptly to over 4,000 feet. From its source twelve miles up in the Juneau Icefield, the Mendenhall Glacier flows between Bullard Mountain and McGinnis Mountain to Mendenhall Lake. <br />DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF WORK.<br />The Alaska Region of USDA Forest Service is seeking qualified contractors to deliver two items: (1) a Conceptual Development Plan for the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area (MGRA) and (2) a detailed Master Plan for the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center Unit (MGVC) of MGRA. To complete the MGVC Master Plan the contractor will need to prepare an Environmental Assessment between the preliminary version and final version MGVC Master Plan. The final MGVC Master Plan will reflect changes brought forth during the Environmental Assessment.<br />The MGRA Conceptual Development Plan will guide the development of recreation infrastructure in the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area accommodating the anticipated visitation needs over the next 20 years with a goal of addressing all anticipated demand, while providing a vision for the next 50 years. The geographic scope of this effort will include the entire MGRA and accommodate all that want to visit the site by dispersing use throughout the MGRA. Trails and wildlife viewing are important activities to be incorporated into the Conceptual Development Plan. The plan will include both text and graphic depictions of the site to guide future facility developments that help achieve multiple purposes.<br />A conceptual development plan, as used here, is general in nature and shows by schematic diagram the relationships between various land uses and forms of circulation within the site. It illustrates the relationships between proposed development(s) and existing and proposed site conditions. Typically a site analysis is completed as part of this work based on available information for topography, vegetation, soils, hydrology, existing infrastructure, etc. The plan shall include, as a minimum, proposed vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns and location of parking areas, service areas, building locations, and other appurtenances considered in the overall design. Site development capacity (e.g, persons at one time, number of cars) should be included, and illustrative cross-sections through specific areas are desirable in providing the intent of the site design commensurate with large area development plans.<br />The second major work product is a site-specific master plan for the MGVC unit. Master planning will balance opportunities and constraints of the current site, the needs of the site to serve the public and to protect resources, and to fulfill management objectives such as transportation efficiency and sustainability, accessibility, energy conservation, improved visitor experiences, and resource protection. The master plan will identify how to best serve the immediate needs at the site. In addition there will be a series of conceptual designs depicting site specific improvements, which will likely require additional topographic surveys.<br />There will be a need for public charrettes to inform the public and gather information and critiques of the work completed for both components of the project; many of these meetings will be able to serve both projects. It is anticipated that much of the information gathered and generated in the Conceptual Development Plan will assist in refining the MGVC Master Plan. There will also be public meetings that will conform to the requirements specified for NEPA analysis of the conceptual designs completed for the MGVC Master Plan. It is anticipated there will a total of between six and eight public meetings/charrettes.<br />Any designs shall incorporate current accessibility standards: Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS); the Forest Service Outdoor Recreation Accessibility Guidelines (FSORAG) and The Forest Service Trails Accessibility Guidelines (FSTAG). <br />The Government is relying upon the Contractor to provide complete planning and design services in the performance of this work. We envision the team will bring innovative ideas based on research of other locations that will challenge our existing perceptions and ideas, and excel at involving the public and constituents in an engaging, positive process to harness the ideas and connection of the people to the area. It is anticipated that the team will consist of the following disciplines: Landscape Architects, Landscape Planners, Civil Engineers, NEPA Specialists, Public Involvement Specialists and Subject Matter Experts in some or all of the following topics: climate change, economics, ecology, glaciology, natural resource interpretation, renewable energy, sustainable tourism, visitor and recreation trends, terrestrial and aquatic biology, transit systems for parks, sustainable building design.<br />SCHEDULE<br />The Forest Service anticipates awarding four total task orders for this work. The period of performance for this requirement (all task orders) is anticipated to be two years from date of award.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR BIDS<br />(Term: Up to 5 Years)
<p>A. The National Park Service and Gateway National Recreation Area</p>
<p>1. The National Park Service and its Mission</p>
<p>America's National Park Service was created by Congress to "conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such a manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." Additionally, the Congress has declared that the National Park System should be, "...preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States." The National Park Service has as its overall mission the preservation and public enjoyment of significant aspects of the nation's natural and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>To learn more about the National Park Service, visit our website at www.nps.gov. This site includes information about who we are, our mission, NPS policies and individual parks.</p>
<p>2. Gateway National Recreation Area<br /> <br />Gateway National Recreation Area (Area) provides a national park experience in the country's largest metropolitan area. The park preserves a mosaic of coastal ecosystems and natural areas interwoven with historic coastal defense and maritime sites around New York's Outer Harbor. Beaches, marshes, waters, scenic views and open space offer resource-based recreational opportunities to a diverse public. It is a getaway for millions of visitors every year.</p>
<p>The Area includes 26,000 acres of land and water, spanning locations in New York and New Jersey. It has three distinct, non-contiguous areas: Staten Island, Sandy Hook and Jamaica Bay. Except for Sandy Hook, which forms the northern tip of the New Jersey shore, the Area occupies coastal land in the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island in the City of New York.</p>
<p>Located on a peninsula in Staten Island, Great Kills Park-part of Gateway National Recreation Area-is 580 acres of open space where visitors can enjoy many recreational amenities or explore the wildlife still thriving in New York City. Great Kills Park is known locally for its ecological resources. It is home to the only osprey nesting site on Staten Island and contains special nesting platforms provided for the birds to inhabit. The name Great Kills originates from a Dutch word meaning "many creeks." Today, the waters are popular with boaters and fishermen alike.</p>
<p>In the Area's enabling legislation, the NPS was directed to conserve the natural resources, fish, and wildlife of the Jamaica Bay area and to permit no development or use of this area incompatible with this purpose (16 U.S.C. &sect; 460cc). Additional information on the Area can be found at www.nps.gov/gate.</p>

<DESC>Notice is hereby provided that pre-solicitation synopsis notice dated 06/30/2015 for Solicitation N00189-15-R-Z051 is hereby updated and replaced as detailed below. The anticipated release date of Solicitation N00189-15-R-Z051 is on or before 10/01/2015.  Upon its release the solicitation will be posted electronically to the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil.

The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (NFLC) Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to competitively procure on a 100% Small Business Set Aside Basis the  digitization and conversion of all Navy Membersâ€™ Service Treatment Records (STRs), both Medical and Dental, and the management and delivery of the scanned STRs to the U.S.
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) through  the automated Healthcare Artifact and Information Management Solution (HAIMS) repository system in support of the Department of the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED).  BUMED estimates the workload at 50,000 STRs annually which equates to approximately 12 million digitized images per year.  The required services shall be performed at a contractor operated facility located within 30 miles of the BUMED Project Management Office (PMO), BUMED Detachment, 4300 Good Fellow Blvd, Bldg 103, St. Louis, MO 63120, hereafter referred to as the central cell conversion center. 

The contractor shall provide conversion services of paper STRs (Medical, Dental, ALHTA Web Print (AWP), and DD-2963 processing) and loose medical documentation; document preparation to include validation of scanning, indexing, reassembly of folders, and confirmation of delivery of images in a searchable electronic format to the HAIMS repository system; and programmatic support services.
  The contractor shall furnish the requisite technology and associated scanning equipment, hardware and software infrastructure, tools, materials, staff, and other services as necessary for the performance and management of conversion services of paper STRâ€™s to electronic images.   The contractor shall convert the paper based STRs to electronic images at 300 dots per inch (dpi) in a Portable Document Format (PDF).  The contractor shall deliver data that is 99.5% accurate, complete, and comprehensive to include 100% image of all usable documents.  The contractor shall transfer the scanned information into the HAIMS system via a government approved and provided Information Technology (IT) Network connection.
 The Government approved and provided IT network, exclusive of scanning equipment, will be furnished by the Government until such time as a Business to Business (B2B) connection into Military Health System (MHS) is approved and established.  The contractor will have one year from date of award to obtain approval and establish the necessary Business to Business (B2B) connection to the MHS.

The required programmatic support services include technical support for identification, tracking, implementing, uploading into HAIMS, analyzing, and reevaluating comprehensive compliance initiatives for the STR process.  In support of these compliance initiatives, the Contractor shall analyze and provide metrics on a weekly basis on such data as:  the total number of unique SSNâ€™s received and uploaded into HAIMS, which are greater, and less than 45 days; average number of days from receipt to upload into HAIMS; and break down by active duty, reservist, echelon II commands, UICâ€™s, and parent command.
  The Contractor shall analyze the data and provide delinquency rates by Echelon II commands and individual UICâ€™s/parent command to the NMRA PMO/COR. The metrics developed by the contractor shall be utilized for the purposes of assisting BUMED with developing presentations for instructions, executive conference, and meeting facilitation; training; and document publication/distribution as it pertains to the Navyâ€™s metrics in meeting the Secretary of Defense Compliance initiatives for the STR process.  The contractor is not responsible for conducting the presentations, meeting, training, etc., solely for assisting with its developments.  

The contractor shall support short-term projects and produce a minimum of two (2) standard reports each week for the purposes of improving STR timeliness, tracking, and processing that must be completed with a product such as definitive reports or presentations as an output.
  The contractor shall develop these projects based off the needs of the Government such as:  how many STRs are shipped from a particular MTF for a particular time; how long does it take an STR on average to be shipped from a particular MTF; and what particular type of STRs are being shipped from an MTF during a particular timeframe.  The contractor shall have additional reporting requirements as implementation compliance process matures.  The reporting requirements shall be focused on STR processing to include timeliness, monitoring of STRs processed and upload timeframes into HAIMS.  This shall include ADHOC reports that are uncharacteristic in type because of the timeliness requested by senior leadership.
  Contractor can expect a minimum of 10 or less ADHOC report requests during a month, which can include: STRs NOT manifested but received; or SSNs mistyped on the manifest; total number of STRs received for unique SSNs; percentage uploaded within 45 business days; and average number of days to upload into HAIMS.  The Contractor shall respond to ad hoc report requests as required.  The Contractor shall also develop training/lesson plans for end users located at MTF/ Dental Treatment Facility (DTF) for packing and shipping records, and shall host 4-5 Defense online Collaboration Services (DCS) training sessions per year, scheduled via NMRA PMO/COR. 

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate competitively on a 100% Small Business Set Aside (SBSA), best value basis.
 The placement of a single Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) contract is anticipated encompassing a Base Period or Performance commencing on or around 01 March 2016 through 28 February 2017, plus four one-year option provisions to extend the term of the contract through 28 February 2021, if all options are exercised. The Government is using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described services. Interested vendors will be requested to submit both non-price and price proposals. The evaluation for contract award will consider the non-price proposal more important than the price proposal. The solicitation is anticipated to be issued to the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil under Solicitation N00189-15-R-Z051.
 The applicable NAICS code is 561410 with a small business size standard of $15 million. Prospective offerors must possess an active registration in the System For Award Management (SAM) database at www.sam.gov to be considered for award. Please direct any questions to Mary Mezzatesta at mary.mezzatesta@navy.mil.

<DESC>Synopsis
A-E Solicitation for Indefinite-Quantity Type Contracts for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4

The U.S. EPA is seeking qualification statements from Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for various A-E services in the states covered by EPA Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4. The states in the covered area are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.  The EPA does not have major facilities in all of these states. Work will primarily be at completed at major EPA-owned or leased facilities at the following locations:  Research Triangle Park, NC; Edison, NJ; Gulf Breeze, FL; Athens, GA; Narragansett, RI; Montgomery, AL; Fort Meade, MD; and Chelmsford, MA.

EPA intends to award one or more indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts under this acquisition, with a target effective date of April 1, 2017.  Each contract is expected to have a five-year performance period, with a minimum order amount of $25,000. The estimated value of a contract is $3 million. Task orders are expected to typically range between $25,000 and $250,000, although some will likely be higher or lower.  Loaded hourly rates (inclusive of overhead and profit) for each major discipline will be negotiated for each contract year. These loaded rates will serve as the basis for pricing task orders. 

Task orders under each contract are expected to include the preparation of designs, plans, specifications, cost estimates, studies and reports, surveys, and construction phase services. Projects may involve alterations, renovations and additions to research facilities and office buildings, including site and infrastructure. The work will primarily involve government-owned property, but leased property may be included. Work will be submitted in hard copy report format, hard copy D-size drawings, and/or CADD and other electronic formats. 

The services required may include all major professional A-E disciplines, including architecture, electrical and mechanical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, landscape architecture, cost estimating, lab planning, space planning, and construction phase assistance. Required disciplines will vary by project. Additional information relative to specific EPA projects to be performed under any resulting contract(s) is not available at this time.

The required A-E services are being procured in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer Selection Act (P.L. 92-582) as implemented by FAR 36.6 and EPAAR 1536.6. Selection will be non-project specific. Firms will be selected for contract negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. 

This procurement is a total small business set aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330, Â¿Engineering ServicesÂ¿, and the relevant small business size standard is average annual receipts for the last three (3) fiscal years not exceeding $15 million. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to contract award (FAR 4.1102). Register via the SAM website at https://www.sam.gov.

SIGNIFICANT EVALUATION FACTORS -- The A-E must demonstrate its qualifications and the qualifications of each key team member, with respect to the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance:

(1) SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE and TECHNICAL COMPETENCE - Specialized experience and technical competence in programming, design (including energy conservation and sustainable buildings design), and construction phase services for analytical and research laboratories, laboratory support facilities, office space, and laboratory support facilities. Identify recent experience (within the last 5 years) of the A-E team members, individually and collectively as a total team in renovation projects for research facilities, associated office and support space, and infrastructure, including project surveys, studies, designs, including working drawings and specifications, cost estimates, and construction phase services. Recent LEED project certification experience is required.  Recent experience in energy modeling and ASHRAE Standard 90.1 is required.  Recent experience in new research facilities will be evaluated favorably. It is very important that the documented experience demonstrates the ability and willingness of the A-E to respond to small-to-medium-sized projects, as they are expected to be the most common under any resulting contract.

(2) PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS - Professional qualifications in the following disciplines: (1) Licensed Architects with LEED Professional Credentials. (2) Licensed Mechanical Engineers with LEED Professional Credentials (3) Licensed Electrical Engineers (4) Licensed Structural Engineers (5) Licensed Civil Engineers (6) Licensed Landscape Architects. The evaluation will consider demonstrated, documented, and relevant education, training, registration, voluntary certifications, overall and relevant experience (highlighting recent achievements within the last five years), and longevity with the firm of key management and technical personnel. Additional certifications (e.g., LEED, NCQLP, CEM, and ASHRAE) will be evaluated favorably. The submittal shall demonstrate that the A-E and its team members have all the necessary licenses and certifications required to provide professional design services. Each design discipline shall be supervised by a licensed professional in the respective discipline. All key personnel must be professionally registered in their discipline.

(3) CAPACITY - Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates. The submittal should indicate the A-EÂ¿s present workload, and demonstrate the capacity to perform approximately $500,000 in EPA A-E work in a one-year period. Identify all current projects being designed in the A-E firmÂ¿s office, showing dollar value, start date, completion percentage, and the anticipated completion date. List any ongoing or anticipated projects that are expected to be active after April 1, 2017.

(4) PAST PERFORMANCE - Past performance on Government contracts and private industry contracts with respect to the quality of work conforming to good workmanship, cost control, and compliance with performance schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior; commitment to customer satisfaction; and business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Points of contact provided under other criteria may be contacted by EPA for reference purposes.  Provide facility owner documentation of the firmÂ¿s performance for each project listed as experience under Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 above.  If no documentation exists, so state on the SF330. For each project provide name, title, address, telephone number, and e-mail address of ownerÂ¿s representative. 

Provide a current client reference point of contact for a minimum of five (5) relevant projects completed in the last two (2) years. Provide for each project name, title, address, phone/fax number, and e-mail of ownerÂ¿s representative. A desire for smaller projects, but also the ability to handle medium sized projects, should be demonstrated. Provide the estimates for the relevant projects that were listed, identifying the initial A-E construction budget, bid price of project, amount of change orders and percent of changes for the various major divisions (architectural, mechanical, electrical, structural, and civil). Provide copies of awards and letters of appreciation/commendation. 

Provide a current client reference for at least one (1) LEED Certified project.  Provide more than one (1), if necessary to document the past performance of the Architectural and Mechanical team members.  Provide the name, title, address, telephone number and email address of ownerÂ¿s representative.

Identify any projects on which proposed team members have previously collaborated.  Attach to the SF 330 a chart showing which team members worked on each project.

(5) LOCATION -- Firms must have an existing active design production office in the general geographic area, with preference given to firms located within 100 miles of Research Triangle Park, NC; Edison, NJ; or Gulf Breeze, FL.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested parties having the capabilities to perform this work must respond to the solicitation package and submit a letter of interest along with four (4) copies of Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, and four (4) copies of any attached additional photographic and/or technical materials.

<DESC>Solicitation# DOSMC60105<br />PSC Code: D302<br />Contract Award Dollar Amount:0.00
<p>Contracting Office Address:<br />Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)&nbsp;-NCR<br />PO Box 549<br />Fort Meade, MD 20755-0549</p>
<p>Primary Point of Contact:<br />Gloria Velasquez<br />gloria.r.velasquez.civ@mail.mil<br />Phone: 301-225-4504</p>
<p>Synopsis:<br />Notice of Intent (NoI) To Award a Sole Source Contract Action:<br />The Defense Information System Agency (DISA) National Capital Region (DITCO)-NCR PL63 intends to award a non-competitive (i.e. sole source) contract to Expression Networks LLC., 1600 Tysons Boulevard, 8th Floor, McLean, VA 22102. The cited authority for this action is 10 U.S.C.&sect; 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. (FAR 6.302-1/DFARS 206.302-1.)</p>
<p>A. Description of Action:<br />Contract action is the award of a one-time contract vehicle to Expression Networks LLC, using a firm-fixed price contract. This requirement is for Joint Spectrum Data Repository (JSDR) and Integrated Spectrum Desktop (ISD) Supplemental Development and Sustainment Tasking of which Expression Networks LLC is the only responsible source (who can provide successful configuration and implementation of the Joint Spectrum Data Repository version 2 (JSDRv2)).</p>
<p>B. Description of Supplies/Services:<br />The contract supplements the tasking being performed through the ongoing development contract for Joint Spectrum Data Repository (JSDR) and Integrated Spectrum Desktop (ISD) Supplemental Development and Sustainment Tasking related to the ongoing GEMSIS effort.</p>
<p>C. Contractor's Unique Capabilities/Qualifications:<br />There is only one source capable of providing the support required to establish the necessary expertise on the JSDRv2 architecture, the spectrum data, and data exchange standard that would be required to keep the program on time and within acceptable cost parameters. This new JSDRv2 has been incorporated into the GEMSIS ACAT III program of record, which is approaching the Increment 2 Block 3 Milestone C with Full Operational Capability (FOC) to be achieved by 4Q 2017. Due to the time and cost constraints of completing GEMSIS Increment 2 Full Operational Capability (FOC), it is imperative to acquire as an interim measure, supplemental developmental and sustainment tasking to the ongoing JSDRv2 rapid development effort to allow for completion of new items that have been identified to be necessary to prepare the JSDR program for sustainment. This will allow GEMSIS to meet other Increment 2 Key System Attributes (KSAs) within the Increment 2 timeframe that have not been able to be successfully addressed through other efforts.</p>
<p>In accordance with the aforementioned, Expression Networks LLC has been identified as the only responsible source of satisfying this requirement. DISA-NCR intends to award on a sole source basis by 13 May 2016, for a Base + One (1) Option Year.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This NoI is not a request for quote or proposal. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. Therefore, this NOI also serves as a "Sources Sought" announcement. Any contractors who can demonstrate their capability to perform these required services without needing a transition period should indicate their written interest by April 26, 2016 by 09:00 AM Eastern Time. Oral communications are not acceptable. Offerors may send correspondence to the following e-mail address gloria.r.velasquez.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>D. Place of Performance:</p>
<p>DISA Joint Spectrum Center<br />2104 Turbot Landing<br />Annapolis MD, 21402-5064</p>
<p>&bull; Set-Aside Status: Sole Source<br />&bull; NSN: N/A<br />&bull; This is an Information Technology Services, not a manufactured item<br />&bull; A solicitation with a notice of intent to award a sole source contract will be advertised on FedBizOpps and sent directly to Expression Networks LLC requesting a quote.<br />&bull; Qty: 1<br />&bull; Destination: See above Place of Performance information <br />&bull; Duration of contract: Base + 1 Option Year<br />&bull; Anticipated award date: 13 May 2016</p>

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for the procurement of brand name CommVault Simpana software maintenance support.  

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services: The proposed action is to procure brand name CommVault Simpana software maintenance support for existing CommCell systems and Veterans Health Administration (VHA) VA Medical Center (VAMC) servers and database backups containing critical data in support of direct patient care operations for VA Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) Service Delivery and Engineering, Field Operations Region 3.  CommVault Simpana is utilized within Region 3 facilities to provide standardized backup, file replication, and data recovery solutions that meet facility disk tiering and data protection requirements.  CommVault Simpana software is currently deployed as the backup software for all of Region 3, Non Vista Data Centers and Vista Data Centers, including the Warner Robins Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) .  This software is also required to support Region 3 alternate site processing of its critical virtualization environment.  Specifically, the software maintenance support includes bug fixes, upgrade releases and enhancements, and periodic updates.  The period of performance for this action is 12 months from August 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017. The total estimated price of the proposed action is 
                        
4.

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: Based on market research, as described in section 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is available among resellers.  This action is for the procurement of CommVault Simpana software maintenance in support of Region 3 VHA VAMC servers, and database backups of critical data in support of direct patient care operations.  CommVault Simpana backup software is utilized across all 44 of Region 3's facilities, as well as the Region 3 Vista Data Center - Warner Robbins DECC to build a standardized file archiving and backup solution.  VA has established a centralized file backup system, wherein all Region 3 CommVault licenses are consolidated into the three Region 3 CommVault Commcells located at the Cleveland Data Center, Orlando Data Center, and the Warner Robins Air Force Base Defense Information Systems Agency/DECC Data Center.

VA requires ongoing backup jobs to be monitored from one console and currently utilizes a one console, one solution architecture to manage the Region 3 non- Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) data center and facility assets, which has provided significant improvement in Region 3 core system service line operations and support.  CommVault Simpana is the only software that provides compatibility with a one console, one solution system to manage backup jobs including disk to disk, disk to tapes and also provides visibility to all physical locations.  Additionally, in accordance with Region 3 Core System Standards, backup software is required to have agentless backup capability and archived data must be searchable without full file retrieval from the data center.  The CommVault Simpana Suite is the only software that has these capabilities.  No other backup application or company can provide maintenance and support for CommVault Simpana due to its proprietary code.  Furthermore, no other product can transmit file level and block level data into a single encrypted transmission to backup files in remote locations, which is required by VA standards.  In accordance with VA Security requirements, backup software is required to have Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 certification.  CommVault Simpana Suite is the only software that has this required certification and due to its proprietary code, only Commvault Simpana or authorized resellers of Commvault can provide the maintenance support and updates to the aforementioned software.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D) the resulting contract award will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page as this Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity's estimated value is more than $150,000.  This Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity will be posted on the NASA SEWP V website with the solicitation.  

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government will continue to perform market research to determine if there are any new maintenance services available that will enable future requirements to be competed.

8.  Market Research:  The Government's technical experts conducted market research in February 2016 by conducting internet searches and reviews of published 
technical data for backup software.  The Region 3 OI&T team looked at the backup software products from multiple vendors to include CommVault Simpana, Asigra, Netbackup, and Symantec Backup Exec software.  The backup software offered by Asigra and Symantec Backup Exec do not provide the capability to manage backups through one console, one solution. Netbackup and Asigra do not provide agentless backup capability or searchable archive capability.  The Commodities Enterprise Contract (CEC) is not a viable alternative for this acquisition since stand-alone CommVault Simpana Suite software maintenance is not currently available on CEC.

Additional market research was conducted in February 2016 by the Contract Specialist utilizing the NASA SEWP V GWAC Provider Lookup tool that identified 10 prospective Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) GWAC holders within "Group B(2) - SDVOSB" that are resellers of brand name CommVault software products and maintenance that meet the requirements of this acquisition.  Furthermore, NASA SEWP V has a dynamic catalog where line items can be added based on customer requests; therefore, as long as the required item or service is within scope of the NASA SEWP V GWAC, items and services can be added to a NASA SEWP V GWAC holder's catalog on a daily basis. These requirements have been found to be within scope of the NASA SEWP V GWAC in a separate determination. 

Other software that provides similar maintenance such as NetBackup or Symantec Backup Exec does not have access to CommVault Simpana proprietary code to provide maintenance support and system updates.  In addition, only CommVault Simpana CommCell Suite software has the required FIPS 140-2 certification.  None of the brands researched can meet all of VA's functional requirements as discussed in paragraph five of this document.  Based upon this research, the Government's technical experts have determined that only CommVault brand name software can meet all of VA's requirements.


9.  Other Facts:  None.

There are no options available under the existing Task Order.
<p>This proposed task order award is a bridge task order to the expiring task order 0008 under contract<br />HQ0034-11-D-0002.
