<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years entitled State Outcome Measurement and Management System (SOMMS) Central Services.  The goal of this project is to implement and manage the State Outcomes Measurement and Management System (SOMMS) to receive from Federal data bases, other contractors, and on occasion, directly from State Agencies,  data on SAMHSA’s National Outcomes Measurement (NOMS) domains for substance abuse prevention and treatment and mental health prevention and treatment.  The information developed will be used for the purposes of seeking improvements in treatment and prevention outcomes as well as to facilitate policy decision-making at national and State levels.  The contract includes tasks to result in standardized definitions and measures for NOMS, technology and statistical methods to match pre- and –post service records and match records for the same individual across service providers, develop performance management reports and benchmarking strategies.  The contract requires close coordination with other Federal contractors, other Federal agencies, and knowledge of performance management issues at the provider, State, Federal project Officer, and federal senior executive levels. In addition, a significant element of this contract is on-site assessment of the data collection and management and related information technology platforms in State agencies and development of plans for up-grades that are required for a State to meet the performance requirements of SAMHSA to participate in the SOMMS program.  This will require specialized systems integration, hardware, and software expertise and the ability to closely coordinate with evaluators, health services researchers, and negotiate between State agencies.   The focus of this procurement will be to:  Convening Experts:  Assist SAMHSA in identifying researchers, practitioners, and research methodologists in substance abuse prevention and treatment to develop and standardize National Outcome Measures for all programs in substance abuse prevention, treatment, and mental health.  Data Collection and Preparation:  Provide SAMHSA with a full range of support in receiving, editing, storing, and sharing National Outcomes data from States, territories, and grantees using an integrated relational database for program monitoring, evaluation, and analysis.   Assistance to States:  Provide technical assistance to States and Territories in developing State data infrastructure and determining requirements and planning improvements to State information technology to collect, clean, and submit to SAMHSA unduplicated client level National Outcome Measures from administrative records.  Analytic support:  Provide SAMHSA with a full range of analytic support including the preparation of analytic data files using SAMHSA databases, NIDA Clinical Trial data, and other Federal/Non Federal databases.  The support should also include statistical programming, statistical analysis, literature searches, technical writing and editing of written products, developing presentation materials, and consultation on statistical and analytic methods such as regression analyses, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), variance estimation and other statistical and methodological tools.  Logistics Support:  Provide travel, lodging and meeting support for experts convened to design analytic plans for analysis of policy issues or develop operational measures for select  NOMS domains.  Certain of the tasks will require senior systems analysts, while others will require senior health services analysts and statisticians with knowledge of the mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention services continuum.   The estimated date for issuance of this RFP is May 12, 2005 with proposal responses due June 13, 2005.  This solicitation may be obtained in any of four ways; by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1051, Rockville, MD 20852; FedBizOps, or, electronically at the SAMHSA web site: http:/samhsa.gov/contracts.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for hardware, software and firmware maintenance support, calibration support, and technical support of the equipment Spirent Communications Global Positioning System (GPS) Radio Frequency (RF) Satellite Constellation Signal Simulator, model STR4760 (S/N 2074 and 2075).  The period of performance is for a base year and four option years. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Spirent as it was determined that their Simulator design is unique, and based on their own company-proprietary information and specifications. That is, products, upgrades, and support from one manufacturer are totally incompatible with the products, upgrades, and support from any other manufacturer. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 13, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<b>Primary Vendor: </b> One Primary Vendor award shall be made for each committee, to include all subcommittees of that committee.  The only exception will be the Committee on Appropriations, where Primary Vendors will be assigned for each individual subcommittee.  When necessary to supplement hearing coverage by the Office of Official Reporters, assignments of hearings of a committee, or its subcommittees, will be made to the Primary Vendor of that committee.  <br> <br>

The Primary Vendor must: <br>
Accept assignments of its designated committees and/or subcommittees up to its Stated Capacity, as described in Section B.5 Stated Capacity. <br> <br>

The Primary Vendor may: <br>
Accept assignments in excess of its Stated Capacity. <br>

Refuse any assignment, without penalty, when given Late Notification. <br> <br>

<b> Rotating Pool: </b> The Office of Official Reporters (OOR) shall maintain a Rotating Pool list, which shall consist of all qualified vendors who have opted to participate in the Rotating Pool.  If the Primary Vendor refuses an assignment, the OOR shall assign the hearing to another vendor in the Rotating Pool.  Subsequent hearing assignments not covered by the Primary Vendors shall be offered to successive eligible Rotating Pool Vendor participants.  Rotating Pool Vendors will be offered their Primary Vendor assignments before being offered Rotating Pool assignments.  Participation in the Rotating Pool is optional.

Participation in the Rotating Pool is not automatic nor mandatory.  Only those bidders who respond ‘Yes’ to the query in Section B.3 will be included.

<DESC>Section SF 1449 - CONTINUATION SHEET

STATEMENT OF WORK
The Air Force Reserve has a requirement to upgrade from a ½ rack configuration on our VTC hub to a full rack configuration to support existing VTC requirements and to allow for required growth (currently two additional rooms).  Our current hub configuration is “maxed” out and there are no additional slots for cards needed to support additional AFRC customers.  Because of this, there is a need to provide for additional connectivity to other AFRC VTC users in the headquarters through the addition of another ATLAS switch.  Our requirement is to remove the current ½ rack, and replace it with a full rack configuration with shelves and to provide an enclosed cabinet, add an additional Atlas switch, and all associated cabling to connect to the existing hub infrastructure. Additionally there is a need for 2 PC’s to support Web Commander and management utilities for the ADTRAN switches from the hub rack.  Our current configuration does not allow for this capability.  Installation of two rack mountable PCs  with appropriate A/B switches so we can switch between ATLAS devices is needed.  To accomplish this, all existing hardware and wiring will have to be reworked into the new cabinet.
SF 1449 SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED ON 29 APRIL 2005.

The RT-1XXX/APX-100 transponders above are part of the AN/APX-100(V) family of Legacy Transponders that has been manufactured exclusively by Raytheon (formerly) Allied Signal, and therefore, there already exists complete provisioning, logistics and mainten ance support in place.  This sole-source solicitation is not meant to be used as a vehicle for the Army to procure an upgraded/updated replacement for the current legacy AN/APX 100 Systems.  Replacement of the legacy Transponder Sets is a tri-service obje ctive that will be satisfied with the Army acquisition of the new RT-1836( C )/APX-118( C ) Transponder starting Fiscal Year 2005.  The above version C RF Modules and A2 CCAs are sub-assemblies of the RT-16XX(V)/APX-100(V) Transponders.  There is currently no detailed Technical Data for the RT-1471A/APX-100(V) and RF Module sub-assemblies available from the Army.  The government does not possess adequate drawings and other final documentation for the RT-16XX/APX-100(V) Transponders and A2 CCAs. The Transponders shall be warranted to meet the following criteria: Form, fit and functionally interchangeable (down to the module/circuit card assembly), with Raytheons Part Numbers. Meet requirements for DOD AIMS 97-1000 (DoD International AIMS Pr ogram Performance Standard, para. 4.1), DoD AIMS Program Office approval is required prior to procuring COTS/NDI to be used as replacement for an interface with existing AIMS systems. CECOM will not want to spend the time and money to AIMS qualify new Tra nsponder sets or incur any  additional cost due to new/additional provisioning, logistics and maintenance support for a different AN/APX-100 configuration. Production Lead Time of 6-9 months is required for Transponders and 6 months for RF Modules.   Meet the requirements of MIL-R-81876B The RF Modules and A2 CCAs shall be warranted  to be form, fit a functionally interchangeable with Raytheons Part Numbers. When the RF modules and A2 CCAs are assembled in the RT-16XX(V)/APX-100(V) Transponders, the Transponders shall meet all the above T ransponder criteria. The current commercial source for Transponders, RF Modules and A2CCAs that meet all the above criteria is Raytheon Systems Company.  Detailed Technical Data and updated/current drawings are not available from the Army.  In addition thi s market survey is to locate additional commercial sources for Depot Repair Support Services for the AN/APX-100 Transponder System.  This will be an effort involving total and complete organic repair down to the piece part level and the contractor will hav e to overcome problems relating to repair parts obsolescence when problems of this nature arise.  This effort shall also include procurement of r epair material and retrofitting of RT-12XX/APX-100(V) and RT-15XX/APX-100(V) units into RT-16XX/APX-100(V) units to incorporate Modification Work Order (MWO) 11-5895-1037-30-2.  These tasks include repair of Weapon Replaceable Assemblies (WRA), Line Replac eable Units (LRU) and indentured Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRA).  The services and materials to be provided to the government will not reflect total government repair needs, but only the repair and availability needs that, which at any given point in ti me, are discovered to be above and beyond that which government depot facility can accomplish in the timeframe necessary, using government depot facilities and/or other levels of repair (AVIM, AVUM, SRA etc.).

<CONTACT>Elena Gertes 619-532-2894
<DESC>This is published as a sole source announcement under the authority of the test program for commercial items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  The proposed contract action is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii). See Note 22.  The NAICS code for this action is 621511. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, CA intends to award a sole source contract to Quest Diagnostics (Quest), 7470 Mission Valley Road, San Diego, CA 92108 to provide diagnostic testing of a host of laboratory specimens for the Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD).  Tests include stool electrolytes, stat cortisols and urine drug confirmations. Quest is required to provide test results for STAT samples within 24 hours after receipt of specimen and without the use of a second reference laboratory. For other than STAT samples, Quest is required to provide test results within a 3-working day turn-around-time.  Call back of critical value within 1 hour of verifying results is also required as well as providing daily courier service to transport specimens from the NMCSD laboratory to its testing facility. Quest is also required to have a board-certified clinical geneticist available for immediate consultation with regard to the test results. It is critical t! o the timely diagnosis and treatment of patients that the same laboratory performs the initial and follow-up testing.  The NMCD has numerous patients monitored through Quest during the course of their treatment and has consistently provided accurate, reliable and timely test results, all of which are essential to the accurate diagnosis and treatment procedures.  Should a laboratory other than Quest perform anyone of the required tests during the patients’ course of treatment, disruption in services and/or change in testing methodologies and standards could occur, which would compromise the integrity or validity of the test results.  It is therefore critical to the long term monitoring of a patient’s condition that the same laboratory perform all the required testing to ensure standardized methodologies are used and thereby maintain the integrity of the testing process and test results.  The proposed contract is for a base period of three months, from 1 July 2005 through 30 September 2005, with 4 one-year option periods to follow.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, and provide evidence of HIPAA compliance, CLIA certification and CAP accreditation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all statements of interest and capability received no later than 12 May 2005. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All statements of interest/capability documentation must be submitted via email attachment or fax to the attention of Ms. Elena Gertes, Contract Specialist at 619-532-2347.  Mailed d! ocuments are not acceptable and will not be considered.  All questions pertaining to this synopsis shall be submitted by e-mail only and must be received no later than 9 May 2005.   Solicitation N00244-05-T-0548 issued to Quest will be posted to www.neco.navy.mil on or about 15 May 2005.

ARUP is also required to have a board-certified clinical geneticist available for immediate consultation with regard to the test results. It is critical to the timely diagnosis!  and treatment of patients that the same laboratory performs the initial and follow-up testing.  The NMCD has numerous patients monitored through ARUP during the course of their treatment.  ARUP has consistently provided accurate, reliable and timely test results, all of which are essential to the accurate diagnosis and treatment procedures.  Should a laboratory other than ARUP perform anyone of the required tests during the patients’ course of treatment, disruption in services and/or change in testing methodologies and standards could occur, which would compromise the integrity or validity of the test results.  It is therefore critical to the long term monitoring of a patient’s condition that the same laboratory perform all the required testing to ensure standardized methodologies are used and thereby maintain the integrity of the testing process and test results.  The proposed contract is for a base period of three months, from 1 July 2005 through 30 September 2005, with 4 one-year option periods to follow.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, and provide evidence of HIPAA compliance, CLIA certification and CAP accreditation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all statements of interest and capability received no later than 12 May 2005. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All statements of interest/capability documentation must be submitted via email attachment or fax to the attention of Ms. Elena Gertes, Contract Specialist at 619-532-2347. !  Mailed documents are not acceptable and will not be considered.  All questions pertaining to this synopsis shall be submitted by e-mail only and must be received no later than 9 May 2005.   Solicitation N00244-05-T-0549 issued to ARUP will be posted to www.neco.navy.mil on or about 15 May 2005.

<DESC>There is no RFP package to download.  This proposed contract is an unrestricted procurement.  Services include, but are not limited to the preparation of facilities and land use planning studies and documents of various types normally used by the U.S. Navy, and such technical services related to such documents and software as may be requested by the Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific (NAVFAC Pacific) for projects and activities at various locations in the Pacific and Indian Ocean Area (primarily, but may include CONUS locations).  The primary task anticipated for the Architect-Engineer (A-E), is the originating and the updating of planning studies and documents.  Additionally, the A-E may be assigned ancillary work to edit and rework incomplete or preliminary planning documents into final completed products based on technical knowledge and skills gained by professional training and experience in the planning and maintenance of military and Government facilities and installations.  Planning documents, as referred to herein, include but are not limited to any document relating to Master Plans, Capital Improvement Plans, Regional Shore Infrastructure Planning (RSIP) Overview and Functional Studies, Special Planning Studies, Air Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) Studies, Land Use Studies, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Studies, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Studies, Military Training Studies, Space Studies (e.g. Administrative), Military Construction and Special Projects write-ups (normally on Department of Defense Standard Form 1391) with supporting documents (e.g. Cost Estimate Site Plans, Floor Plans, NEPA documentation, etc.), Engineering Evaluations (EEs), Facilities Requirements Plans (FRP), Basic Facility Requirement (BFR) justifications, Facility Planning Documents (FPDs), Economic Analyses (EA), System Safety documents, Site Approval requests, Environmental Studies, Civil Engineering Support Plan, Land Inventory Analyses, studies, visual presentations, graphics, and/or any component or portion (not necessarily the entirety) of such documents.  Field verification survey work may also be an ancillary part of the planning process.  Any preparatory work, visual presentation, briefing, study, or report, which may be required prior to the initiation of any planning document listed, is also included under this contract scope.  Planning projects may include those for other U.S. Military Commands and Agencies (e.g. U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard and other U.S. Agencies) in the Pacific and Indian Ocean area (primarily, but may include CONUS locations), in addition to those of the U.S. Navy.  The A-E shall provide all professional services required for the completion of planning documents, including researching data, conducting site surveys, preparing, reviewing, and editing technical text and graphics to ensure completeness and correctness of documents.  When such services are required of the A-E for projects not wholly assigned to the A-E alone, the A-E must exercise professional judgment to verify the correctness and validity of the information, and the results and conclusion of the material the A-E is called upon to finalize.  The A-E must analyze, coordinate, correlate, synthesize, correct, supplement, and finalize the work assigned.  As an example of such an assignment, if the A-E is called upon to finalize the draft of a document or a particular graphic submitted by NAVFAC Pacific, the A-E shall rework such document or graphic until, in the A-E's judgment, the finished product is correct, complete, and reflective of the A-E's professional judgment and standards. RSIP-Link Integration: Provide electronic deliverables for the publication of planning documents and the integration of source data used or generated during the planning process into the data libraries of the Regional Shore Infrastructure Plan (RSIP-Link) information system.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is an independent federal agency charged with making recommendations to Congress and the Administration on issues, policies, and laws affecting people with disabilities. NCD is responsible for gathering information about the implementation, effectiveness, and impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

NCD's work in this area over the last three years has focused on identifying the problems or gaps in ADA implementation and on understanding what factors enhance or impede ADA implementation. In the 2003-2004 "Righting the ADA" project, NCD analyzed the effects of unfavorable Supreme Court interpretations in ADA cases, and developed legislative recommendations for restoring the ADA to its original intent. NCD is currently conducting an ADA Impact Study, gathering information about the impact of the ADA and determining whether the goals of the ADA are being achieved. Building on findings from this earlier work, NCD would like to bring together ADA stakeholders for input into developing recommendations on how to improve the implementation of the ADA and how to make the goals of the ADA a reality for individuals with disabilities. 

The contractor will establish a mechanism whereby ADA stakeholders, including individuals with disabilities, businesses, employers, state and local governments, and federal agencies, can have a national dialogue on ADA implementation and examine strategies for more effectively implementing the ADA. The contractor must demonstrate the ability to successfully identify, and reach out to, relevant stakeholders, to facilitate consensus building among groups with different perspectives and interests, and to assist NCD in developing an effective public information and awareness campaign. Based on the stakeholder input, the contractor will prepare a final report to contain specific recommendations for improving implementation of the ADA.

The estimated contract period is 12 months. NCD will distribute its Americans with Disabilities Act Implementation Project Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on May 15, 2005. NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by June 20, 2005. Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up at NCD on or after the issue date of May 15, 2005. All requests must reference the RFP number and title. For more information, contact Julie Carroll, jcarroll@ncd.gov, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004; 202-272-2004 or 202-272-2074 TTY.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis an Axon Genepix 4000B Microarray Scanner from Molecular Devices, 1311 Orleans Drive, Sunnyvale, California 94089.  This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 as the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR Part 13.5.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The NCI CCR Office of Science and Technology Partnerships requires the Axon 4000B microarray scanner.  This purchase will allow NCI/CCR Researchers to maintain the compatibility of the data analysis already being received by NimbleGen.  The NimbleGen arrays are very specialized in that the size of the oligonucleotide features (5 microns) on their microarrays is so small that only certain scanners have the resolution to allow acceptable imaging and quantification of the signals produced.  Molecular Devices is the only source known that can provide the Axon Genepix 4000B microarray scanner which is the most compatible scanner in using the NimbleGen microarrays.  The existing scanner that NimbleGen scientists are currently using in their in-house microarray service core is the Axon Genepix 4000B. Changing the scanner for future microarrays will change the variables and will interrupt correct interpretation of the studies being currently performed.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracts office by 1:00 PM EST on May 9, 2005.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. All correspondence must state solicitation number NCI-50042-NG.

This agent is being studied as an adjuvant to other agents in various types of cancer. Montanide ISA -51 VG Sterile Injection, 3 ml ampules is an agent which is intended to boost immune reactions to other experimental peptides.  It is not commercially available in the United States.

FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Service, (November 1999) applies.  Seppic, Inc. is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned substance.  This substance is involved in patient care, therefore must remain consistent with ongoing treatment.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.

<DESC>Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) herein known as the Contractor, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide the services described below to prequalified bidders only.  To be deemed prequalified to bid on the RFP, potential bidders must respond affirmatively and with sufficient detail to the "Prequalification Criteria" section, Questions 1 through 12, addressing their specific areas of expertise and qualification.

Summary Scope of Work:

Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) has a need to obtain subcontract drilling services for drilling and monitoring well completion activities for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  These wells will be used to geotechnically and geophysically characterize the bedrock that underlies planned buildings and other associated structures being designed for an underground high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, in southern Nevada.  All drilling activities will occur within Area 25 of the Nevada Test Site.

Up to 15 boreholes are planned for this drilling program to depths of approximately 500 to 700 feet each (well above the regional water table located at ~1300 feet deep).  A subset of these holes (approximately 8 to 10) will be drilled to an 8-1/2" nominal diameter to obtain high quality chip-sample cuttings for stratigraphic interpretation and geophysical logging activities, prior to completion as monitoring wells.  The remaining holes (approximately 5 to 7) will be conventionally cored  (HQ size minimum) and then reamed to an 8-1/2" nominal diameter, prior to completion as monitoring wells.  All holes are planned as vertical with the exception of one borehole, which will be angled at approximately 30 degrees to 45 degrees from vertical.  Wet drilling techniques are required (i.e., mud rotary, foam, etc), with reverse circulation methods strongly preferred. Access to a source of non-potable water will be provided by BSC.  

Well completion activities in all holes will consist of installing 4-inch nominal diameter schedule 80 PVC casing to total depth of each hole.  The annulus of the PVC casing will be grouted with neat cement from total depth to surface.

A state of Nevada licensed well driller is required for this drilling program. 

Location of the Work:

All work shall be performed at Area 25 within the Nevada Test Site.

Period of Performance:

The estimated RFP issuance date is May 2005.  The anticipated planned date for award of the Construction Services Subcontract is June 2005. The estimated period of performance is to begin work in July 2005, with an expected duration not to exceed six (6) months.

Subcontract Type:

It is anticipated that a Lump Sum/Firm Fixed Price Unit Rate Subcontract will be awarded for this requirement.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order entitled, “Addressing the Safety Culture and Climate Survey”with Gantz Wiley Research for the services of Dr. Leo Brajikovich, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13-106-1(b).   Under this purchase order, Dr. Brajikovich will be conducting team building sessions and providing all supporting facilitation tasks to assist the Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) Division Directors, Deputy Division Directors, Team Leaders and Staff  with developing actions that can be implemented to improve the OCFO workplace environment.  Dr. Brajikovich was a major player in NRC’s Safety Culture and Climate Survey conducted in Fiscal Year 2002 that identified improvement is needed in the OCFO workplace environment.  Dr. Brajikovich developed and implemented the approach, tools, and guidance for identifying actions to make improvements, and assessed the effectiveness of the actions taken through focus groups and individual interviews.  Dr. Brajikovich is currently conducting team building sessions with OCFO senior management.    Consequently, Dr. Brajikovich possess unique organizational development and workplace culture skills, particularly those relevant to the NRC and OCFO, that are necessary to move the OCFO organization forward in improving the workplace culture and continue the process initiated. He has established a high level of trust with OCFO senior managers and staff which is critical to the success of this effort.  Using the services of another contractor would require a duplication of effort that would not be recouped through competition.    To bring another contractor up to the level of competency of Dr. Brajikovich would result in additional estimated costs ranging from $25,000 to $35,000 and additional time to complete the work ranging from 6 to 8 weeks.  Another contractor would have to gain expert knowledge of the survey structure and results, review the approach methodology employed by the OCFO to develop actions to improve the workplace environment, review the assessment results of those actions, and develop a new approach and action plan to conduct team building sessions. The period of performance is approximately five months from date of contract award.  This notice of intent is neither a request for quotes or a solicitation of offers.  Interested firms must submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform the required services to the above address not later than 15 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities.  Capability statements that do not fully demonstrate the respondent’s ability to satisfy the requirements above will not be considered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial vessel support to deploy two 10-Meter Buoys in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This announcement is a Request for Quote.  The reference number is NWWG9500-5-23927 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-03.  The National Data Buoy Center intends to award a single purchase order for commercial vessel support services to deploy two 10-Meter Buoys.  The following Statement of Work (SOW) provides contractor information necessary to prepare bids:

This Statement of Work (SOW) provides contractor information necessary to prepare bids to tow two NDBC 10-meter buoys used for open ocean meteorological data, and deploy the buoys at coordinates 15 degrees 00 minutes 00 seconds N, 080 degrees 00 minutes 00 seconds W & 15 degrees 06 minutes 03 seconds N, 075 degrees 04 minutes  03 seconds W.  The job will originate at the Gulfport Mississippi Municipal Docks (GMMD).  These 10-meter buoys provide part of the National Weather Service Hurricane forecast data, which is available for public use.  The contractor shall submit bids on the total cost of operation for vessel and crew.  

The tow vessel will take control of the buoys at GMMD, located at approximately 30 degrees 21 minutes 25 seconds N, 089 degrees 05 minutes 48 seconds W.  The vessel will tandem tow the 10m buoys to coordinates 15 degrees 00 minutes 00 seconds N, 080 degrees 00 minutes 00 seconds W and deploy buoy 10D09/42057.  The vessel will remain on scene while NDBC personnel prepare the buoy for operations, take ground truth, and de-ballast the buoy, which will last approximately 8 hours.  The vessel will continue to coordinates 15 degrees 06 minutes 03 seconds N, 075 degrees 04 minutes 03 seconds W and deploy 10D07/42058.  The vessel will remain on scene while NDBC personnel prepare the buoy for operations, take ground truth, and de-ballast the buoy, which will last approximately 8 hours.  The vessel will then return to home port. 

Each mooring consists of three parts: the upper mooring and retrieval pendent which is composed mostly of 1 1/2 inch open link chain; the middle mooring is made from 1 3/4 inch nylon and 2 1/4 inch poly line; and the lower has 1 1/2 inch open link chain and a sinker and anchor.  See attached mooring drawings for details.  The buoys are discus shaped steel buoys, with dimensions 33 ft diameter with a 33 ft mast, drawing 3.5 ft draft.  NOAA buoys weigh approximately 115,500lbs plus 55,000lbs of ballast.  The buoys will be ballasted for towing by NDBC personnel.  

Towing operations are scheduled to commence on or about May 23, 2005 and shall conclude with return to the designated port.  The ship shall take possession of both of the buoys and then tow to the designated locations.  The government will provide a towing hawser, if requested. 

There are maximum sea states in which the vessel is expected to operate, up to Beaufort sea state four (4). The decision whether to go or no-go when considering weather conditions shall be made by mutual agreement between the NDBC representative and the boat Captain, with the Captain having the final authority to postpone, cancel, or delay a mission.   Due consideration will be given to the safety of the vessel and personnel aboard at all times. A no-go decision because of weather will not be considered cancellation of the contract. 

The contract will be a firm-fixed-price, per day charge.  The per day charge will include all costs necessary to perform the contract, including but not limited to the following: estimated transit times from port to site and port-of-return, vessel rental fees (if applicable), vessel reconfiguration and restoration costs (if applicable), fuel/ oil consumption, and food and accommodations for 4 to 6 NDBC representatives.

Captain shall be licensed for offshore transportation to the location specified.  The vessel must meet all United States Coast Guard requirements.  Vessel specification sheets shall be provided with the bid.

The contracted vessel will load the NDBC gear and personal at a location chosen by the Captain and return to vessel’s home port.  
				
The ship requires sufficient padeyes or hold-downs on the deck to accommodate equipment during transit, and for the conduct of mooring operations.  Two padeyes are required near the stern (within approximately 20 ft of the stern) capable of rigging a bull chain supporting 20,000 lbs.

The vessel must have suitable lifting equipment to safely handle the mooring chain, anchor, and associated equipment as per attached mooring diagram.

Small boat suitable for safe transportation between vessel and buoy during mooring/ground truth operations.

The stern section of the vessel shall be free of bulwarks and obstructions to accommodate towing.  The edge of the deck that runs along the stern section must not have any sharp edges to chaff the hawser.

NDBC reserves the right to conduct a survey of the vessel prior to awarding the contract.

The contractor must carry adequate liability to cover persons, equipment, and any damage/loss that might result from operations during the course of the trip. Note: Complete replacement cost for a 10-meter buoy is approximately $ 245,000.

Prior to the commencing operation, NDBC technicians will conduct a meeting with all vessel personnel to assure everyone understands the details of the operation and what each person must do to assure a safe and successful mission. Agreement between the ship’s operator(s) and NDBC personnel regarding safety and operational procedures shall be reached prior to commencement of the trip.  Inability to settle any disagreement between parties to the satisfaction of NDBC as a result of failing to follow NDBC procedures that could lead to personnel injury or damage/loss of a buoy(s) could result in cancellation of the contract.

Both 10m buoys will be towed from GMMD to the first deployment site at 15 degrees 00 minutes 00 minutes N, 080 degrees 00 minutes 00 seconds W.

Deploy buoy 10D09/42057 and mooring as specified on attached mooring diagram.

The vessel will remain on scene approximately 8 hours while NDBC personnel prepare the buoy for operation, take ground truth, and de-ballast the buoy. 

The vessel will continue to coordinates 15 degrees 06 minutes 03 seconds N, 075 degrees 04 minutes 03 seconds W and deploy 10D07/42058 and mooring as specified on the attached mooring diagram.

The vessel will remain on scene approximately 8 hours while NDBC personnel prepare the buoy for operation, take ground truth, and de-ballast the buoy. 

The vessel will return to its home port off load NDBC personnel and equipment.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Stevens Institute of Technology, Office of Sponsored Research, is researching breakthrough techniques which have recently shown promise to effectively determine the individual location of sensors within a sensor network.  The Acoustic Center of Excellence has been tracking progress that the university has made recently, and finds particular promise in the Multiple Access Control MAC) methodologies.  Using novel multiple access control schemes (MAC), it is possible to separate multiple users which may be communicating simultaneous streams in an ad hoc network.  The university is considered uniquely qualified apply MAC technologies to the specific problem of Army distributed sensor systems, modify algorithms as required, and perform limited prototype testing using actual communications systems. A sole source effort with Stevens Institute of Technology will provide the government with significantly improved algorithms and methodologies for performing a wide range of future prototype demonstration tests for distributed sensors and will significantly advance the performance as well as the fielding potential of future distributed sensor network systems.

<RESPDATE>061505
<ARCHDATE>07152005
<CONTACT>Edward Czekaj, Contract Specialist, (973)724-4009
<DESC>The Government, RDEC-ARDEC, located at Picatinny, NJ 07806 intends to solicit  for the following commercial item, a Precision High Speed Fuze Spin Stand  (â€œspin standâ€). The scope of this effort is to provide upgrades, modifications,  and enhancements as well as process prove out for new and existing fuzes.  The  Spin Stand will be used to test the safe and arming and related actions of fuze  components in support of research and development efforts.  The Contractor shall deliver the following equipment (Fuze Spin Stand) in  accordance with the listed specifications.   i.	Spin rates controllable up to 100, 000 revolution per minute (RPM) inclusive, for small caliber test specimens.  â€œSmall caliberâ€ refers to test  specimens of up to 16 grams. ii.	Spin rates controllable of up to 30,000 RPM inclusive, for large  caliber test specimens, up to 3 pounds. iii.	Acceleration time to test speed to be â€œas quickly as practical.  During  gun launch, acceleration from zero to full speed occurs within the order of 0.1  seconds.  Understanding that it is highly unlikely to meet this rate in a  mechanical system, this RFQ does not set a specific requirement threshold.  As  such, proposals will be evaluated on maximum acceleration, without being  disqualified for not meeting â€œgun launchâ€ rates.  Any offeror who chooses to  include any type of expendable clutch element for high-acceleration test modes,  must include a minimum of ten (10) sets of replacement hardware. iv.	All spinning elements shall be mechanically shielded for safety.   Offeror shall provide details regarding shield material, thickness, and  capability to contain catastrophic failure of test specimen. v.	All removable shields shall include interlocks to avoid operation when  not in use. vi.	Spindle shall provide electrical connection from test specimen to  outside instrumentation, via minimum of 12 independent slip rings or similar  contact configuration. vii.	Spindle vibration control and/or damping â€“ Offeror shall provide design  details describing methodology used to ensure that system is capable of  controlling vibration and adequately addressing vibration & balance problems  throughout the entire range of spin rates.  Because of the inherent nature of  fuzing design, which typically employs the movement of components with respect  to the axis of rotation and also the center of mass, it must be assumed that  test specimens will be off-balance to some degree during normal operation, by  design (i.e., off-center mass is typically used to react to spin and activate  various elements of a fuze.  Also, it can be expected that center of balance  may change slightly during normal sequence of operation (i.e., movement of a  weighted rotor or similar component driven by spin).  viii.	Precision tachometer with digital readout, to display rotational speed  in terms of RPM, including a chronographic capability to display & record  elapsed time.  Offeror shall provide design details with regard to methodology  of sensing, transmitting, interpreting and recording rotational speed. Optional  Instrumentation â€“ Proposals may be evaluated on the basis of optional  equipment and the ability to install at a later date, that may be available,  and described within proposal, without obligation or commitment to purchase  said optional equipment as part of this solicitation as follows: i	High-speed/high-resolution video recording equipment, including related  processing software & hardware, including synchronization with rotational  speed.  Offeror shall provide design details, specifically regarding accuracy  of the system and synchronization methodology, actual frames per second rates  of camera(s) as well as any higher synthetic frames per second rates, and  details as to computer/data processing methodology used to generate any such  higher rates. ii	Visual image system including any appropriate analysis software &  hardware, useful to observe moving parts, and also provide dynamic stress  analysis types of data.  Offeror shall provide design details, and specific  capabilities of any such analytical system available as optional equipment for  subject spin stand. iii	Any additional instrumentation arrangements that would be useful in  analyzing fuze components operating in high-spin environment. Contractor shall provide operational manuals for delivered equipment. Contractor is not required to submit drawings. Contractor may provide maintenance plan (parts and labor) for years beyond  warranty.  The maintenance plan for the out years will be listed as Option  Clins in the subsequent award document. 	Contractor shall be responsible for providing training on, delivery,  and installation of equipment (minimum 2 visits per year to verify if parts  appear worn and need replacement or repair).   Contractor shall warrant all parts and labor for one full year after the date  of installation.  Inspection and acceptance shall be F.O.B. destination. The Statement of Work, Evaluation Factors, and Submission Instructions should  be released on PROCNET with solicitation on or about 15 days from this notice. The contractor shall ship the equipment to a location to be determined as  specified by the Government.

Statement of Work for
Centralized, Outsourced Mailroom and Imaging Services 
For the Department of Labor, 
Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation


1.	Introduction:  

The Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP/DFEC) administers the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act  (FECA).  FECA provides workers’ compensation coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers including wage replacement, medical and vocational rehabilitation benefits for work-related injury and occupational disease.  Compensation claims filed under the Federal Employee Compensation Act are processed by the Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation (DFEC) program.  

The process of adjudicating and managing these compensation claims requires Claims Examiners within DFEC District Offices to review a variety of documents that must be maintained as part of the case processing record of each claim.  These documents provide the supporting evidence of determinations regarding the admissibility of treatments, the amount of compensation to be granted, and other decisions related to the claim.  These case files, which can range in size from fewer than 20 pages to well over 1000, pose a significant paperwork management challenge for DFEC.

1.1	Purpose:

The purpose of the DFEC Mailroom and Imaging Outsourcing program is to establish a centralized mailroom and imaging capability that will achieve the following DFEC technical, management, cost, and risk mitigation objectives:

&#61692;	Improved mailroom, imaging, and data entry throughput and efficiency
&#61692;	Reduced mailroom, imaging, and data entry costs
&#61692;	Common workflow methodologies and process controls 
&#61692;	Established management and technical expertise
&#61692;	Common processing platform
&#61692;	Robust facility and equipment capacities in support of current and future requirements
&#61692;	Ready availability of back-up facilities, equipment and personnel
&#61692;	Established telecommunications capabilities
&#61692;	Implementation of uniform, established quality control procedure

2.	Requirements

The Contractor shall provide mailroom, scanning, and indexing services for Workers Compensation claim documents in accordance with the requirements stated herein.

At a minimum, this system shall provide the following standard reports which shall be made available to OWCP/DFEC via secure Internet communications:

•	Real-time batch status
•	Backlog/Reconciliation Report
•	Turnaround Report – Snapshot of batch status
•	Quality Report
•	Reject Report

These reports shall reflect real-time statistics relating to production and turnaround service levels.  Additionally, as an option, the Contractor shall provide customized ad hoc reports reflecting unique reporting requirements and make these available to DOL on-line.   The reports should also be available in summary and detail formats, and where possible be made available in a downloadable/importable format. 

2.2	Facility

Mailroom services shall be performed at the Contractor’s facility.  The Contractor shall provide a modern state of the art facility. The Contractor shall maintain at least two geographically distinct facilities capable of supporting the capacity requirements stated in Section 3.1 Below.  These facilities must possess similar imaging and processing equipment in order to support OWCP/DFEC/DFEC in the event of a disaster.

2.3	Mail/Document Processing

Identifying information shall be collected for the tray and used for inventory control and tracking purposes.  Each tray will be entered into the Tracking System, which shall produce real time reports that will be available to authorized OWCP/DFEC personnel via a secure Internet Web site.

Mailroom personnel will process the postal trays and provide an envelope volume count for each tray which will be entered into the Tracking System with the appropriate tray identifying information and employee identifying information.

Contractor shall only process envelopes from returned mail. 

2.3.2	Document Preparation

Document separator sheets will be placed between each multi-paged document.  The Separator sheet bar code will be read by the scanner and will indicate the beginning of a new document for sequencing purposes.  

2.3.3	Sorting

The sorting process will commence with the removal of envelopes from the postal trays, extraction of the contents of each envelope, and entry of the employee and mail data into the Tracking System.    If a Case numbers is not present on the document, the Contractor Shall look up the appropriate case number and annotate it on the document, for later index entry.  OWCP/DFEC will provide an extract of their database, with daily updates, for Contractor use in looking up case numbers.  Two percent of the routine mail is anticipated to require case number lookup.  The documents and associated attachments will be prepared for imaging by removing staples, paper clips, repairing torn pages and performing other necessary document preparation functions.

Contractor shall sort mail by document type and District Office.

Sorted tray data shall be entered into the Tracking System to allow the production of real-time Internet reports detailing the total number of sorted trays, by document type.

At the beginning of each shift, scanner operators shall run the appropriate test target to verify image quality. The scanner will be calibrated at the beginning of each shift based on the results of the test target.  

The document imaging operators will feed the stack header sheets and associated documents within the stack through the scanners.  Scanners shall operate in duplex scanning mode with the threshold set to automate the deletion of blank pages.  As the documents are scanned, hard copy documents and images will be assigned a unique Document Control Number (DCN) as part of the index during the scanning process.  The DCN will be in a format acceptable to OWCP/DFEC and will be imprinted on the document pre-scan along with the case number.  Multi-page documents will contain the same DCN.  

As the documents are scanned, the corresponding images shall be electronically batched and transmitted to the production location for indexing. The Tracking System will be continuously updated with the location of each image. 

Upon completion of the document imaging process, the Tracking System shall produce real-time internet reports detailing the total number of documents scanned, by type, and by District Office.  The scanner operator shall delete batches that are not processed properly during capture.  An operator shall rescan these batches. 

The Contractor shall verify that the numbers of paper pages match the scanned pages.  Quality control personnel shall verify that images have been scanned correctly, blank pages have been dropped, and the image is viewable.  Poor quality source documents will be rescanned to improve quality and if quality does not improve pass a message in the description field indicating best scan possible.  These documents will be identified by DCN on the reject report.

Statement of Work for
Centralized, Outsourced Mailroom and Imaging Services 
For the Department of Labor, 
Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation


1.	Introduction:  

The Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP/DFEC) administers the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act  (FECA).  FECA provides workers’ compensation coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers including wage replacement, medical and vocational rehabilitation benefits for work-related injury and occupational disease.  Compensation claims filed under the Federal Employee Compensation Act are processed by the Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation (DFEC) program.  

The process of adjudicating and managing these compensation claims requires Claims Examiners within DFEC District Offices to review a variety of documents that must be maintained as part of the case processing record of each claim.  These documents provide the supporting evidence of determinations regarding the admissibility of treatments, the amount of compensation to be granted, and other decisions related to the claim.  These case files, which can range in size from fewer than 20 pages to well over 1000, pose a significant paperwork management challenge for DFEC.

1.1	Purpose:

The purpose of the DFEC Mailroom and Imaging Outsourcing program is to establish a centralized mailroom and imaging capability that will achieve the following DFEC technical, management, cost, and risk mitigation objectives:

&#61692;	Improved mailroom, imaging, and data entry throughput and efficiency
&#61692;	Reduced mailroom, imaging, and data entry costs
&#61692;	Common workflow methodologies and process controls 
&#61692;	Established management and technical expertise
&#61692;	Common processing platform
&#61692;	Robust facility and equipment capacities in support of current and future requirements
&#61692;	Ready availability of back-up facilities, equipment and personnel
&#61692;	Established telecommunications capabilities
&#61692;	Implementation of uniform, established quality control procedure

2.	Requirements

The Contractor shall provide mailroom, scanning, and indexing services for Workers Compensation claim documents in accordance with the requirements stated herein.   

2.1	Tracking System

The Contractor shall maintain an automated system for inventory tracking and reporting of all program activities, as described in the following sections.  At a minimum, this system shall provide the following standard reports which shall be made available to OWCP/DFEC via secure Internet communications:

•	Real-time batch status
•	Backlog/Reconciliation Report
•	Turnaround Report – Snapshot of batch status
•	Quality Report
•	Reject Report

These reports shall reflect real-time statistics relating to production and turnaround service levels.  Additionally, as an option, the Contractor shall provide customized ad hoc reports reflecting unique reporting requirements and make these available to DOL on-line.   The reports should also be available in summary and detail formats, and where possible be made available in a downloadable/importable format. 

2.2	Facility

Mailroom services shall be performed at the Contractor’s facility.  The Contractor shall provide a modern state of the art facility. The Contractor shall maintain at least two geographically distinct facilities capable of supporting the capacity requirements stated in Section 3.1 Below.  These facilities must possess similar imaging and processing equipment in order to support OWCP/DFEC/DFEC in the event of a disaster.

2.3	Mail/Document Processing

Contractor shall process all DFEC mail and transmit data to DOL/DFEC within 48 hours from receiving the mail into the facility. Exceptions listed in section 2.4 Out Sorting.

The Contractor shall receive incoming mail via third party courier and USPS at this location and prepare for processing.  Contractor shall establish USPS PO BOX.  Incoming mail will be labeled with appropriate district office identification.
  
Mail in shipping bags shall be received at the Contractor’s shipping dock. Trays of envelopes and packages will be extracted from the shipping bags. Identifying information shall be collected for the tray and used for inventory control and tracking purposes.  Each tray will be entered into the Tracking System, which shall produce real time reports that will be available to authorized OWCP/DFEC personnel via a secure Internet Web site.

Mailroom personnel will process the postal trays and provide an envelope volume count for each tray which will be entered into the Tracking System with the appropriate tray identifying information and employee identifying information.

Contractor shall only process envelopes from returned mail. 

2.3.2	Document Preparation

Document separator sheets will be placed between each multi-paged document.  The Separator sheet bar code will be read by the scanner and will indicate the beginning of a new document for sequencing purposes.  

2.3.3	Sorting

The sorting process will commence with the removal of envelopes from the postal trays, extraction of the contents of each envelope, and entry of the employee and mail data into the Tracking System.    If a Case numbers is not present on the document, the Contractor Shall look up the appropriate case number and annotate it on the document, for later index entry.  OWCP/DFEC will provide an extract of their database, with daily updates, for Contractor use in looking up case numbers.  Two percent of the routine mail is anticipated to require case number lookup.  The documents and associated attachments will be prepared for imaging by removing staples, paper clips, repairing torn pages and performing other necessary document preparation functions.

Contractor shall sort mail by document type and District Office.

Sorted tray data shall be entered into the Tracking System to allow the production of real-time Internet reports detailing the total number of sorted trays, by document type.

The scanner operators shall, at a minimum clean the scanner optics and paper transport at the beginning of each shift, as well as, at periodic intervals during each shift in order to maintain optimum image quality. At the beginning of each shift, scanner operators shall run the appropriate test target to verify image quality. The scanner will be calibrated at the beginning of each shift based on the results of the test target.  

The document imaging operators will feed the stack header sheets and associated documents within the stack through the scanners.  Scanners shall operate in duplex scanning mode with the threshold set to automate the deletion of blank pages.  As the documents are scanned, hard copy documents and images will be assigned a unique Document Control Number (DCN) as part of the index during the scanning process.  The DCN will be in a format acceptable to OWCP/DFEC and will be imprinted on the document pre-scan along with the case number.  Multi-page documents will contain the same DCN.  

As the documents are scanned, the corresponding images shall be electronically batched and transmitted to the production location for indexing. The Tracking System will be continuously updated with the location of each image. 

Upon completion of the document imaging process, the Tracking System shall produce real-time internet reports detailing the total number of documents scanned, by type, and by District Office.  The scanner operator shall delete batches that are not processed properly during capture.  An operator shall rescan these batches. 

The Contractor shall verify that the numbers of paper pages match the scanned pages.  Quality control personnel shall verify that images have been scanned correctly, blank pages have been dropped, and the image is viewable.

<DESC>The following questions and responses are for the Space Radar (SR) Joint Program Office (JPO) sources sought notice that was posted on March 24, 2005 (Reference Number Li-Ion 38) for first-party vendors capable of providing space qualified (or qualifiable) Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) batteries for possible testing evaluation.  No responses are required from vendors as a result of this notice.  a. QUESTION:  Can a foreign battery supplier be used for the SR system? RESPONSE:  Li-Ion batteries have been identified as a potential enabler for the Space Radar (SR) mission.  The SR JPO has an opportunity to acquire Li-Ion batteries for development testing through the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program to support a Li-Ion battery test program plan advocated by The Aerospace Corporation.  The purpose of this test program is to expand the knowledge base of the operational characteristics of Li-ion batteries in support of various space missions, including LEO applications of SR.  Although the FCT program requires that only foreign sources be considered, the SR JPO is actively seeking additional other sources of funding to support testing of domestic Li-Ion battery sources as well.  The SR JPO has not established any guidance with respect to foreign-supplied components like Li-Ion batteries.  At the appropriate time issues including cost, schedule, risk, performance, industrial-base, etc. will be evaluated and guidance provided.  b. QUESTION: Is SR accepting US Based Companies? RESPONSE: The FCT program is designed to test foreign systems/products for evaluation for potential future procurements.  The "Sources Sought" request was to explore the options available for the SR program. c. QUESTION: Are you considering buying batteries from foreign sources? RESPONSE: Yes.  The Space Radar (SR) Integrated Program office is developing a Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) proposal.  According to SAF/IA, this is used to test foreign products from either a foreign company based in the United States or from the foreign manufacturer. d. QUESTION: Does SR want the contractor to test the batteries? RESPONSE: The SR JPO has identified government owned facilities to test Li-Ion batteries acquired via the FCT program.

“Contractor is required to possess a Secret Facility Clearance.”  

The U.S. Coast Guard, under the Deepwater program,  is developing the Eagle Eye Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) manufactured by Bell Helicopter Textron Incorporated (BHTI).  The U.S. Marine Corps is also planning on procuring eight production aircraft to under the VUAV program.  The Eagle Eye is currently still in the development stage, with its first flight scheduled for the Spring of 2005.  The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO) would like to conduct a preliminary infrared (IR) assessment of the Eagle Eye prototype.  This assessment will enable DoD and DHS to characterize the IR signature and susceptibility of a tactical tilt-rotor class UAV.  Currently, there are no tilt-rotor class UAVs in the inventory, and there is no historical data or characterization of the susceptibility of this type of platform to IR threats.  Tactical UAVs are frequently required to operate in environments where there are IR threats and sensors, either from man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), night vision equipment, or ships and aircraft equipped with Infrared Search and Track (IRST) sensors.  These UAVs will operate under war and peacetime conditions, conducting Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance for military forces, for homeland defense, and for counter-drug operations.  This baseline assessment will facilitate development of concepts of operations and provide a technical basis for survivability enhancements to the platform.  “The Government intends to negotiate and establish a Sole Source Firm Fixed Price contract with Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. to perform a preliminary assessment of  the IR signature of the Eagle Eye UAV in  several specific flight conditions, under specific bands and background conditions.  The total estimated dollar value of this procurement is estimated to be $150,000.  Companies interested in responding to this request for information must possess a SECRET facility clearance.  Interested parties MAY be required to obtain/enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Interested parties should submit the following information describing their capabilities to Ms. Mary Broadhurst:  a company pamphlet, brochure, or description of the company’s abilities/history with this type of service; a description of the equipment to be utilized including methods of transporting equipment to the place of performance in Bellevue, Texas; if available - potential cost associated with travel and the collection and analysis of data; the name and telephone number of a company representative that can be contacted, and the company’s address.  Once responses are received, interested parties may be requested to provide a presentation to further describe their capabilities.”  Written responses to this announcement can be submitted to:

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Free & Clear, Inc., 5826 Oregon Avenue, NW, Washington, DC  20015 for a telephonic smoking cessation program to decrease the rate of smoking in veterans served by VAPHS.  VAPHS serves approximately 55,000 veterans, and many veterans who use the system are unable to attend face-to-face smoking counseling becuase of travel distance or time constraints and therefore require an intense intervention delivered via telephone counseling.  Although it is known that only a minority of smokers quit tobacco permanently after attempting to quit, VAPHS seeks a vendor who can provide strong evidence of high one-year quite rates from a smoking cessation intervention so as to maximize the value of the contract.  Specific requirements of the contractor are as follows: 1. Ability to provide intense smoking cessation counseling via the telephone to a large population of smokers. 2. Ability to initiate the program throughout the healthcare system within 2 months of award of the contract. 3. Capable of assessing degree of nicotine dependence and making recommendation about pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. 4. Extensive experience in smoking cessation telephonic interventions that would indicate a high chance of success with patients, many of whom who have smoked for many years 5. Evidence of prior success showing smoking cessation one year quit rates that exceed 20%.  Evidence of this success should include counting all smokers who enter counseling in the denominator and those who report being totally tobacco free 1 year later as the numerator (also known as intent to treat).  Evidence of success should be available in scientific publications based on randomized controlled trials by authors who conducted investigations with the vendor, such that there is high confidence that the rate of tobacco cessation claimed is accurate and conclusions about the success of the program is valid.  6. Ability and track record of ability to work with a large complex geographically disperse organization 7. Counselors who have competency in providing counseling to economically disadvantaged populations and to a population with high prevalence of racial minorities.  8. A well developed approach and evidence of success in recruiting smokers to make a quit attempt with the assistance of telephonic counseling 9. Willingness to document smoking counseling in the VA electronic medical record system.   10. Ability to track quit rates on an ongoing basis and provide frequent data to the VAPHS regarding the number of enrolled patients and employees, and quit rates during the program, at the end of counseling, and after 1 year.  If your firm has the capabilities to meet all of the above requirements and would like to be considered, please submit supporting information to Linda.Glancy@med.va.gov or to Linda Glancy (04A-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206, NLT May 9, 2005 C.O.B.  Technical questions can be directed to Dr. Joseph Conigliaro at (412) 688-6477 or Joseph.Conigliaro@med.va.gov.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Direct User Access Terminal (DUAT) Service  This Market Survey- Request for Information supersedes the original notice, dated March 16, 2005, (Posting ID 4060).  That notice was inaccurate, and did not reflect the agency's requirements and needs.  As we stated in the original notice, on February 1, 2005, the FAA announced the award of the A-76 Public/Private Competition of the Automated Flight Service Stations (AFSSs), excluding the three (3) in Alaska, to Lockheed Martin as the Service Provider (SP).  Correcting the original notice, please be advised the DUATS service is not needed as part of the SP's solution.  In order to ensure that there is no interruption to the functional capabilities similar to DUATS, the existing DUATS service need to be extended. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to negotiate and award up to two contracts to provide the Direct User Access Terminal (DUAT) Service.  The contract type will be Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite Quantity.  The contract will be for a twelve (12) month base period with one (1) one-year option period.  The current contracts end 09/30/2005.  The FAA is surveying the market to determine if qualified vendors are interested in this contract opportunity. The DUAT Service provides on-line current weather information, forecast weather information, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) information, and flight planning services to authorized users.  The DUAT Service is currently provided under two separate contracts, one each with Data Transformation Corp. (a small business) and CSC Information Systems LLC. Interested vendors should respond with a technical statement of experience and proven capability which will be reviewed according to the following criteria: Â·	Ability to provide Final Operational Capabilities (FOC) by COB 30 September 2005 with no gap in service Â·	Approved Qualified Internet Communications Provider (QICP) Â·	X.25 protocol experience Â·	NADIN II certification Â·	Experience providing aviation weather and displaying weather graphics Â·	Experience providing flight planning services Â·	Experience providing a 24 hour, seven day a week Help Desk Â·	Established customer base or demonstrated ability to acquire one Â·	Experience interfacing with the National Airspace System (NAS) Â·	Experience operating telephone and Internet based systems  Â·	Experience providing information security Â·	Experience developing and maintaining large databases Â·	Upon initiation and at regular intervals, new vendors must undergo security certification and accreditation through development and submission of an FAA Security Certification and Authorization Package (SCAP) in accordance with the FAA Information Systems Security Handbook. Each criterion will be reviewed to determine vendor suitability.  All criteria above must be met.  This Market Survey-RFI will be used to determine the extent of industry interest in providing DUATS services.  The FAA is aware that the incumbent vendors are qualified and interested. To assist you in responding to this Market Survey, attached are the current DUAT Statement of Work (SOW), the current QCIP Requirement Specification and the QCIP Advisory Circular. Responses should be addressed to: Elisa Brown, (ASU-350) Federal Aviation Administration 800 Independence Ave., SW Washington, D.C. 20591	 Responses must be received no later than May 12, 2005, 3:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>Greetings,

I potentially have an upcoming requirement to provide furniture for a building at the USAF Academy currently undergoing renovation. Although the set-aside block below notes N/A, that has not yet been determined - there is potential that this requirement may be set aside for small business.  Specifications are not yet defined, but the requirement is anticipated to include executive furniture, conference room furniture, approximately 300 work stations, etc. In addition, the vendor may be required to store the furniture at his facility until the renovation is complete and the furniture can be set up accordingly, as the Academy may not be able to accommodate the storage. 

DISCLAIMER: It is important to note this is an UNFUNDED requirement at this time. As such an award may not be made as a result of this inquiry. 

Also, the NAICS has not yet been determined, but will fall within the 337 area, either 337211, 337214, and/or 337215.  And, the solicitation number has not yet been created, hence the TBD noted in the solicitation number.  To keep apprised of updates (if this project gets funded), access FBO.

NOTE that this is only an inquiry as to your interest, not a request for your proposal. If interested in supplying this requirement, please e-mail Lana Skinner at Lana.Skinner@usafa.af.mil (***NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE***) no later than Monday, 2 May 2005, 2:00 P.M. Mountain Time (that's 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time), stating your interest.  No other information is required at this time except that you include your CAGE code and your Federal Tax ID number in your reply. 

If you are not interested in supplying this requirement, no reply is necessary.

C. 657f) for the purchase of software development services for NIST in the area of robotics.  This is a follow-on procurement to a purchase order previously competitively won by Autonosoft (formerly known as Intelligent Innovations, Inc.).  Autonosoft is a service-disabled, veteran-owned small business, and NIST is not aware of any other service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses with the required expertise in robotics that could satisfy NIST’s highly specialized robotics requirements.  The NAICS code that will apply to this procurement is 541411, and the size standard is $21.0 million.

This purchase order will build upon work that was completed by Autonosoft, Inc. (formerly known as Intelligent Innovations, Inc.) in the past year to link OTBSAF (OneSAF (One Semi-Automated Forces) Testbed Baseline) (the military’s standard combat simulator) and the NIST 4D/RCS architecture.  A summary of the requirements of the new, follow on procurement to which this synopsis applies are as follows:

This includes porting 20 libraries that have been created/modified under past efforts.  The Government estimates, but does not guarantee, that approximately 192 Contractor labor hours may be required to complete this task. This task shall be completed no later than 10 weeks after purchase order acceptance. The deliverables for this task include source code for the modified libraries integrated into the OTBSAF Version 2 baseline release and monthly status reports.

2.	Provide enhancements to existing NML-OTBSAF communications channels.

Under this task, the Contractor must provide software maintenance and enhancements, as necessary, to NML-OTBSAF channels that have been developed under previous efforts.

Statement of Work for
Centralized, Outsourced Mailroom and Imaging Services 
For the Department of Labor, 
Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation


1.	Introduction:  

The Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP/DFEC) administers the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act  (FECA).  FECA provides workers’ compensation coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers including wage replacement, medical and vocational rehabilitation benefits for work-related injury and occupational disease.  Compensation claims filed under the Federal Employee Compensation Act are processed by the Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation (DFEC) program.  

The process of adjudicating and managing these compensation claims requires Claims Examiners within DFEC District Offices to review a variety of documents that must be maintained as part of the case processing record of each claim.  These documents provide the supporting evidence of determinations regarding the admissibility of treatments, the amount of compensation to be granted, and other decisions related to the claim.  These case files, which can range in size from fewer than 20 pages to well over 1000, pose a significant paperwork management challenge for DFEC.

1.1	Purpose:

The purpose of the DFEC Mailroom and Imaging Outsourcing program is to establish a centralized mailroom and imaging capability that will achieve the following DFEC technical, management, cost, and risk mitigation objectives:

&#61692;	Improved mailroom, imaging, and data entry throughput and efficiency
&#61692;	Reduced mailroom, imaging, and data entry costs
&#61692;	Common workflow methodologies and process controls 
&#61692;	Established management and technical expertise
&#61692;	Common processing platform
&#61692;	Robust facility and equipment capacities in support of current and future requirements
&#61692;	Ready availability of back-up facilities, equipment and personnel
&#61692;	Established telecommunications capabilities
&#61692;	Implementation of uniform, established quality control procedure

2.	Requirements

The Contractor shall provide mailroom, scanning, and indexing services for Workers Compensation claim documents in accordance with the requirements stated herein.   

2.1	Tracking System

The Contractor shall maintain an automated system for inventory tracking and reporting of all program activities, as described in the following sections.  At a minimum, this system shall provide the following standard reports which shall be made available to OWCP/DFEC via secure Internet communications:

•	Real-time batch status
•	Backlog/Reconciliation Report
•	Turnaround Report – Snapshot of batch status
•	Quality Report
•	Reject Report

These reports shall reflect real-time statistics relating to production and turnaround service levels.  Additionally, as an option, the Contractor shall provide customized ad hoc reports reflecting unique reporting requirements and make these available to DOL on-line.   The reports should also be available in summary and detail formats, and where possible be made available in a downloadable/importable format. 

2.2	Facility

Mailroom services shall be performed at the Contractor’s facility.  The Contractor shall provide a modern state of the art facility. The Contractor shall maintain at least two geographically distinct facilities capable of supporting the capacity requirements stated in Section 3.1 Below.

Mail in shipping bags shall be received at the Contractor’s shipping dock. Trays of envelopes and packages will be extracted from the shipping bags. Identifying information shall be collected for the tray and used for inventory control and tracking purposes.  Each tray will be entered into the Tracking System, which shall produce real time reports that will be available to authorized OWCP/DFEC personnel via a secure Internet Web site.

Mailroom personnel will process the postal trays and provide an envelope volume count for each tray which will be entered into the Tracking System with the appropriate tray identifying information and employee identifying information.

Contractor shall only process envelopes from returned mail. 

2.3.2	Document Preparation

Document separator sheets will be placed between each multi-paged document.  The Separator sheet bar code will be read by the scanner and will indicate the beginning of a new document for sequencing purposes.  

2.3.3	Sorting

The sorting process will commence with the removal of envelopes from the postal trays, extraction of the contents of each envelope, and entry of the employee and mail data into the Tracking System.    If a Case numbers is not present on the document, the Contractor Shall look up the appropriate case number and annotate it on the document, for later index entry.  OWCP/DFEC will provide an extract of their database, with daily updates, for Contractor use in looking up case numbers.  Two percent of the routine mail is anticipated to require case number lookup.  The documents and associated attachments will be prepared for imaging by removing staples, paper clips, repairing torn pages and performing other necessary document preparation functions.

Contractor shall sort mail by document type and District Office.

Sorted tray data shall be entered into the Tracking System to allow the production of real-time Internet reports detailing the total number of sorted trays, by document type.

Documents shall be sorted into the following categories:

Decisions	Nurse 
Fiscal 	Rehab 
Forms	Non-Scannables 
Incoming Correspondence 	
Medical & SOAF 	
Miscellaneous 	

2.3.4	Image capture

Contractor shall scan all documents and create images using standard TIFF Group IV format at 200 dpi.   

Contractor should be able to accept documents from other electronic sources including faxes and imaged files from Central Bill Contractor.

The scanner operators shall, at a minimum clean the scanner optics and paper transport at the beginning of each shift, as well as, at periodic intervals during each shift in order to maintain optimum image quality. At the beginning of each shift, scanner operators shall run the appropriate test target to verify image quality. The scanner will be calibrated at the beginning of each shift based on the results of the test target.  

The document imaging operators will feed the stack header sheets and associated documents within the stack through the scanners.  Scanners shall operate in duplex scanning mode with the threshold set to automate the deletion of blank pages.  As the documents are scanned, hard copy documents and images will be assigned a unique Document Control Number (DCN) as part of the index during the scanning process.  The DCN will be in a format acceptable to OWCP/DFEC and will be imprinted on the document pre-scan along with the case number.  Multi-page documents will contain the same DCN.  

As the documents are scanned, the corresponding images shall be electronically batched and transmitted to the production location for indexing. The Tracking System will be continuously updated with the location of each image. 

Upon completion of the document imaging process, the Tracking System shall produce real-time internet reports detailing the total number of documents scanned, by type, and by District Office.  The scanner operator shall delete batches that are not processed properly during capture.  An operator shall rescan these batches. 

The Contractor shall verify that the numbers of paper pages match the scanned pages.  Quality control personnel shall verify that images have been scanned correctly, blank pages have been dropped, and the image is viewable.  Poor quality source documents will be rescanned to improve quality and if quality does not improve pass a message in the description field indicating best scan possible.  These documents will be identified by DCN on the reject report.

2.4	Out Sorting

The following documents including all attachments shall labeled with receipt date and forwarded daily to the appropriate District Office Via overnight delivery service without further processing: 

Congressional Inquiries and forms CA1, CA2, CA2a, CA5, CA6, CA7, CA7a, CA7b, CA16.

Medical Bills shall be out sorted to the appropriate Contractor office via overnight delivery without further processing.

The Contractor shall annotate the medical bills with the case number, remove the attachments, and label them with receipt date and forward daily to the appropriate Contractor via overnight delivery without further processing.  The Contractor shall perform case number look up to determine the appropriate district office.  If the case number is unavailable, the district office will be determined by the geographic location of the claimant’s address.  Attachments removed from the medical bills will have the case number annotated and sorted into the appropriate category for processing.

2.5	Quality Control (QC)

The Contractor shall provide random QC on at least 2% of all prepped batches.  Quality control personnel shall, at a minimum, verify that annotated case numbers are correct, the documents are in the correct category, that documents have been correctly separated between each document, that all fasteners have been removed, pages have been repaired as necessary, and the appropriate header sheet is on the batch.  When QC is complete, the batches will be returned for pick-up by the scan operator.   QC shall include a random check of envelopes to ensure that all mail has been extracted from envelopes. Results of the QC/QA check shall be documented in the appropriate report.
	
2.6	Indexing/Data Capture

All indexing shall be performed using Contractor systems, software and personnel and will result in the creation of an electronic data file formatted per OWCP/DFEC specifications.  

Images will be indexed by capturing the data elements outlined in Appendix A.  

All documents will contain the case number as the primary index data element. 

When the index operator keys the case number, the system shall display the claimant name from the case number/claimant name table.   The operator shall verify that the claimant name is correct by matching it against the imaged document. 

The index operator shall capture the author date from the imaged document.  

The category code shall be determined from the subject matter of the document.

The subject code is to be used only on rehab documents and for future use.

After the index entry is complete, the batch shall be routed to a different index operator for verification.  The index verifier shall validate that all data elements are correct.  The verifier will compare the data and enter the correct data.

Quality Control personnel shall perform a minimum quality control sampling of 2% of the daily volume.  Batches will be routed randomly to the quality control operators for quality checks after the verification process.  During the indexing process, Images that are identified as having poor quality due to the scan process shall be rejected and processed for rescan.    These documents will be identified by DCN on the reject report.

2.6.1	Accuracy Levels 

The Contractor shall maintain a minimum indexing accuracy level of 99.5% quality based on field.  

The Contractor shall perform verification of critical index fields.  The Contractor shall monitor each receipt date to assure that the required accuracy level is maintained.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to a fluid handling and servicing system that includes portable equipment to service aircraft and equipment to store and dispense various aviation fluids (e.g. MIL-PRF-83282 hydraulic fluid, DOD-L-85734 transmission and MIL-PRF-23699 engine oil) from 55 gallon drums to the portable fluid servicing units.  The basic servicing unit used to dispense all of these fluids directly into aircraft should have the following general features: (a) Reservoir:  Minimum two-gallon capacity, that can be filled by the bulk fluid handling system as well as by one gallon and one quart cans.  Reservoir should protect fluid from dust, humidity, and rain/fog.  Operator shall be able to see if reservoir requires fluid.  (b) Manual Hand Pump: Self-priming pump with minimum flow rate of 0.8 gpm. (c) Filtration: fluid must be filtered by non-bypassable three-micron absolute filter (d) Servicing Hose: minimum length of 7 ft.  (e) Recirculation Port:  Fluid or air trapped in the delivery hose shall be able to be pumped back into the reservoir without opening the reservoir.  (f) Environment:  Unit shall not be able to be stored and operated under the following conditions:  (1) No leakage if unit is tipped over in any direction or turned completely upside down (2) Tilted Surfaces: Can operate without tip over or movement on a surface that is tilted 15 degrees from vertical whether unit is full or empty. (3) Ambient Air Conditions: Can operate from 0 to 100% humidity, temperature extremes of –65 oF to 160 oF, as well as under wind, sand, dust or salt spray laden conditions. (4) Ruggedness: Survive a two-foot drop test and being dragged on non-skid surfaces with no leakage and only superficial damage. 

For certain fluids the following features are required:  (a) Engine Oil:  Pressure gauge (0-100 psig), resettable fluid totalizer (amount of fluid dispensed to an aircraft the nearest ounce), pressure relief to prevent fluid being dispensed from exceeding 75 psi, bleed valve or similar method to reduce system pressure after servicing aircraft.  (b) Transmission oil:  Low delivery pressure for servicing open-air reservoirs, resettable fluid totalizer (amount of fluid dispensed to an aircraft the nearest ounce). (c) Hydraulic Fluid:  Delivery pressure of up to 250 psi.
Ideally as many parts as possible should be interchangeable between units servicing different fluids, but units of different fluid types should be able to be made noticeably different from each other to prevent dispensing the wrong fluid. (e.g. color, markings, shape, fluid specific quick disconnects).  Information is also requested on fluid handling and storage systems that can fill the portable servicing units from 55 gallon drums.   The handling and storage system can either store fluid in the 55 gallon drum that the fluid is delivered in or can be pumped from that drum into a bulk reservoir.   Include in description preventive measures to prevent cross fluid contamination, facility requirements (e.g. low pressure shop air, electricity, size), spill and leak collection, provisions to protect stored oil from dust and humidity in air, and fluid filtration.  Information is requested on larger wheeled servicing units with capacities up to 30 gallons.  Additionally, information is requested on options for non-manual methods that can use pressurized reservoirs, electrical batteries, small refillable liquid carbon dioxide or high pressure nitrogen cylinders or similar power sources to pump fluid in addition to a manual hand pump. Also requested is a provision for the 3000psi hydraulic dispensing unit and the preservative fluid used in the A/V8B engine. It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 31 May 2005 to Ms. Lori Bishop, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25221B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, or by electronic mail at:  lori.bishop@navy.mil.

<DESC>The United States Military Academy (USMA) is looking for an educational consultant to provide materials, technical data, and services associated with the design, development, testing, documentation, deployment, and quality assurance to support the Vi rtual Information Assurance Network (VIAN) curriculum assessment methodology and plan, and to provide a summary and a detailed analysis report during the execution of testing and upon the completion of the project.  The approximate period of performance fo r this contract shall be May 15, 2005 through June 24, 2006. The Contactor shall deliver to the ITOC a complete assessment plan for the VIAN curriculum to include review of lab modules, development of instructional assessment methodology and execution plan, assessment report, and a final report. The Contractor shall meet the following requirements:  recent academic curriculum development credentials at the undergraduate and graduate level, have taught technical and business focused Information Assurance courses at the under graduate or graduate le vel in the last two years, have current university faculty credentials, have application and networking communications protocols and technologies understanding, be able to demonstrate experience deploying and configuring open source security tools, to incl ude SNORT, Shorewall, Kismet, Ethereal, Ettercap, OpenSSL, Nessus, Metasploit, Knoppix, and Super Scan, be able to demonstrate experience deploying and configuring Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems, have recent experience deploying and using VM ware workstation 4.5 in an educational lab setting. The Contractor shall be responsible for providing the following reports to assist USMA in monitoring and tracking the progress/status of this statement of work:  Monthly Status Report, Performance and Cost Report, VIAN Curriculum review, VIAN assessment pl an, and VIAN final report. The host operating system is Windows XP Professional.  The virtual network is designed to present the user with two internal networks, a red network, containing machines that are used to launch exploits, and a blue network, consisting of target machine s.  These two networks are separated by a firewall (using SNORT) running on one of the Linux guest machines.  A second firewall, also running on a Linux guest machine, acts as a gateway to the host machine.  Each classroom workstation is configured to supp ort two students.  On the blue network, we have two separate installations of WIN 2000 server and Red Hat Linux 8.0 so each dedicated user of a computer has their own set of servers to administer.  The WIN NT, WIN 98, and Red Hat 6.0 machines are target ma chines with no administrative requirements.  There are also no administrative requirements for the red network, so it is shared by each user on a given workstation. This configuration allows each student a virtual network on their machine and provides so me flexibility and creativity for the instructors and the students.

<SUBJECT>L -- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND DATA COLLECTION FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY (P&A) AGENCIES
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems (NAPAS) to provide specialized technical assistance to the 57 designated State and U.S. Territorial Protection and Advocacy  (P&A) agencies and manage a data collection system.  SSA intends to award a contract to NAPAS to manage a data collection system and to provide specialized technical assistance and training to State P&A Systems to help them in their role as authorized by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (TWWIIA).  The purpose of the project is to provide SSA’s P&As with the technical assistance necessary to enable them to provide protection and advocacy services which beneficiaries with disabilities may need to secure, maintain, or regain gainful employment.  Management of a data collection system will enable SSA to measure the effectiveness of the P&A program and will fulfill the grantees’ reporting requirements.  NAPAS is the only known source that can provide all of the requirements described below.  BACKGROUND:  The TWWIIA authorized the Commissioner of SSA to fund P&A Systems to provide advocacy as well information and advice about obtaining vocational rehabilitation and employment services to our beneficiaries with disabilities.  Technical assistance for these entities is required because the law expands work incentives and modifies the way in which P&A Systems may serve beneficiaries.  In 2001, SSA established the Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS) grant program in every State and U.S. Territory.  To support the expanded activities of P&A Systems under TWWIIA, SSA awarded a contract to assist these grantees in the area of dispute resolution services for beneficiaries who want to work.  With Employment Networks now in existence, there is a real need for P&A training surrounding any complaints that may be lodged against these and other entities.  NAPAS has provided P&A personnel with guidance on the policies, processes and procedures necessary to advocate on behalf of beneficiaries with disabilities who are seeking to secure or regain gainful employment  for the past 5 years.  In 2004, NAPAS developed a database to facilitate the comprehensive reporting required of SSA P&A grantees.  REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall provide technical assistance to the 57 State, US Territorial and Native American P&A agencies participating in the project as follows: (1) Provide dispute resolution assistance and training to P&A personnel as disputes arise between beneficiaries and the employment networks and other service providers from which they are seeking or receiving services; (2) Conduct a training seminar for new PABSS personnel using material previously developed to address policies, processes and procedures that P&A personnel need to advocate on behalf of beneficiaries with disabilities; 3) Act as a liaison for the flow of communication between SSA and the P&A agencies.  This includes disseminating information to all of the participant P&A projects at the request of SSA, as well as conveying information to SSA on behalf of the projects.  Note:  contractor must have SSA’s prior approval on any material furnished to the P&As for this program; 4) Coordinate at least four (4) teleconferences per year, open to the entire network pf SSA-funded P&A projects, on emerging policy and legal issues including systemic issues about vocational rehabilitation, employment and support services; 5) Develop Social Security work groups (Employment Campaigns) with respect to employment-related issues concerning beneficiaries living with HIV, persons with brain injuries, persons in segregated employment settings, and youth transitioning from school to work; and 6) Facilitate a web-based discussion monthly regarding an employment-related issue relevant to SSA-funded P&A advocates and attorneys.  The contractor shall manage and maintain a web-based data collection system for the SSA-funded P&A program as follows: 1) Host the web location for which this web-based application will reside; 2) Manage user accounts for the data collection as well as the reporting application and 3) Manage any changes to the data elements requirements.  The contractor shall provide technical support for the use of the web-based data collection system.  The contractor shall attend meetings, prepare reports, and provide information to SSA, when requested, to enable SSA to respond to public inquiries.  The period of performance will be for a base year with three 1-year options to extend the term of the contract.   NAPAS is the only known organization with the subject expertise and familiarity with the issues to provide the required specialized technical assistance.  Specifically, NAPAS is fully versed in the intricacies of protection and advocacy case law, P&A management issues, and methods to increase the effectiveness of these agencies in providing services to Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities.  Additionally, NAPAS is the only organization with the resources, previous experience and competence to immediately assume the responsibility of providing assistance to all 57 State and U.S. Territory P&A projects.  NAPAS has been involved in these types of services with the government and SSA since 1997.  NAPAS is the provider of the web based software application “Disability Advocacy Database” (DAD).  DAD is the client management system used by the P&A network, and NAPAS has been the developer and manager of this service for over six years.  SSA knows of no other source that has the capability to satisfy all of the requirements for this contract.  Interested parties that believe they have the capability to perform the services required should submit a capability statement to Barbara F. Hands by mail to: SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, OFFICE OF ACQUISTION AND GRANTS, G-C-7 EAST HIGH RISE BUILDING, 6401 SECURITY BOULEVARD, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND 21235; by email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov; or by fax to 410-966-9310.  All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND DATA COLLECTION FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY (P&A) SYSTEMS, and shall be received no later than 3:00 p.m. (EST) MAY 16, 2005.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.    A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with NAPAS.  All questions must be submitted in writing to the mailing address or email address listed above and marked to the attention of Barbara F. Hands. Telephone calls will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>39 -- FPI
<DESC>Under the provisions of FPI's guidelines process, published March 12, 1997, in the Federal Register and March 25, 1997, in the Commerce Business Daily, FPI submits the following "good faith" announcement for public notice and comment.  FPI proposes to manufacture containers for sale competitively to the United States Postal Service (USPS), without mandatory source.

Under FPI's guidelines covering the production of new products and significant expansion of existing products, the primary determinant of what constitutes a "specific product" is an item's Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code.  USPS containers fall within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 3920 - Materials Handling Equipment, Non Self-Propelled.  FPI has recorded sales in this category every year since FY 1997.

Under FPI's guidelines, the secondary determinant of what constitutes a "specific product" is an item's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code.  No SIC code specifically includes USPS containers.  The most appropriate SIC codes for USPS containers are:  SIC 3444 - Sheet Metal Work;  SIC 3496 - Misc Fabricated Wire Products; or SIC 3499 - Fabricated Metal Products, N.E.C.  FPI has made items in each of these SIC codes for several years.

FPI has a history of making items in both the FSC code and SIC code for USPS containers.  For this reason, FPI believes USPS containers do not meet the definition of "new product" set forth by FPI's guidelines. However, FPI recognizes that a reasonable person may construe this item to be a product separate and distinct from any other made by FPI. 

Under the terms of FPI's expansion guidelines, interested parties may submit comments regarding this proposed production by FPI. In submitting comments to FPI, the following guidelines will apply:

1) Comments will be due within 21 days of the date of this notice;

2) Relevant comments will focus on and address why USPS containers should be considered a new product, separate and distinct from a similar item currently produced by FPI;

3) While the primary purpose of the comments will be to determine if the item should be defined as a new product, comments related to market share and/or the impact resulting from such a production decision may also be considered relevant.

All comments received in response to this announcement will be considered by FPI.  All commenters will be advised when FPI makes a final determination.  Any interested party has a right to raise any question at any time with FPI's Board of Directors.  

All comments should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Planning, Research and Activation Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

This proposed action is for commercial items for which the Government intends to acquire the brand name items on a sole source basis under 41 U.S.C. 253(C)(1).  The USDA, OCIO, ITS Operations Security Branch (OSB) already has multiple installation of Dell servers for its standard Vulnerability Assessment Project which allows the Government to decrease costs on parts and provide for no downtime.  Utilizing standard servers allows the OSB to have fewer builds; more easily swap equipment or parts; maintain fewer spare parts; and interface with fewer vendor maintenance personnel.  These are costs which could not be recovered through competition.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a quotation.  All responses received by the response date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the brand name requirements based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to debbie.sanders@ftc.usda.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-03 and DFARS Change Notice 20050222.

The Contractor shall provide an assessment predicting facility component life expirations using statistical guidelines and nationally recognized references for cost data to model building system costs.

Destination; FAR 52.249-8 Default (Fixed Price Supply-Service).  Evaluation of Commercial Items:  The following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate proposal submission:  (1)  Identify in writing where the material is coming from and how it will be dried to meet the specified moisture content of approximately 6-12% and (2) The ability to meet the required delivery date of June 3, 2005 (fifteen working days after contract award) or sooner.  The evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance each worth 50 points.  Award of any contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation will be based on best value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Technical quality is significantly more important than cost or price.  Price will be a factor in the award decision, although the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  As the technical merit and evaluated cost or price becomes essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.  The Government reserves the right to make award without further discussion.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-02. The proposed contract is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561730 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.  

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is responsible, in accordance with Executive Order 13112 – Invasive Species, for maintaining ten (10) acres of land for its radar facility site located at SW 137th Avenue and SW 168th Street, Miami, Florida. Since at least 1993, the year the NWS KAMX WSR-88D radar was installed, no management or control of exotic plant and hardwood species has been performed on the site. The purpose of this Request for Quotation (RFQ) is to develop and implement a work plan for the first year of removing and reducing the growth of exotic plant species and non-native hardwoods on the NWS ten acre site.  

Site Background: The NWS site was previously owned by the military and is within an area referenced as the Perrine Limited Training Area (LTA). The site was part of the 2,107 acre Richmond Navel Air Station (NAS Richmond) which was active from 1942 to 1945 and ceased operations following a major hurricane.  In 1960, the U.S. Army acquired about 227.7 acres of the former NAS Richmond. Some of the land was developed, but an area of approximately 136 acres remained undeveloped as the Perrine LTA. On November 26, 2002, the General Services Administration (GSA) transferred 10 acres of the former Perrine LTA to the U.S. Department of Commerce for establishment of a clear zone adjacent the NWS radar site.  

Two federally endangered plant species have been identified on the Perrine LTA, the Deltoid Spurge (Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. deltoidea) and the Tiny Polygala (Polygala smallii). The property also contains a critically imperiled ecosystem, the Richmond Pine Rocklands, and wet prairie natural areas. In addition to the two endangered plant species identified on the Perrine LTA, for the Richmond Pine Rocklands, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) lists two plant species Crenulate Lead-Plant (Amorpha crenulata) and Small’s Milkpea (Galactia smallii) as endangered, one species Garber’s Spurge (Chamaesyce garberi) as threatened, and 12 species as candidates for listing. Of the twelve species, nine occur in the Richmond Pine Rocklands area where the Perrine LTA is located.

The site presently has medium to high density of exotic plant and hardwood species with the Burma Reed (Neyraudia reynaudiana) and Brazilian Pepper Tree (Schinus terebinthifolius) being the most prevalent. However, the site contains other exotic plant species and non-native hardwoods which need to be treated. Although some areas of the site are disturbed, there is an abundant seed source of native plants in the area to recolonize the treated areas. At this time, no restoration work is planned for re-establishing native plant and hardwood species at the site.       

The former Perrine LTA is bounded on the south by SW 176th Street and the Army Reserve Center. The property is bound to the west by SW 137th Avenue and the same Army Reserve Center. The Federal Bureau of Prisons – Metropolitan Correctional Center borders the property to the north and the Dade Zoological Park borders the property to the east. The site presently has some minor development which includes the NWS radar facility and associated gravel access roadways.  

Work Plan: The purpose of this Request for Quotation (RFQ) is for the Contractor to develop and implement a work plan for the first year of removing and reducing the growth of exotic plant and hardwood species on the NWS owned ten acre site. Development of the work plan requires a visit to the ten acre NOAA site as discussed under “Section 5.0 Scheduled Site Visit.” As a minimum, the work plan shall include:  
A.  A discussion as to how exotic plant and hardwood species will be identified at the site for treatment.  
B.  A discussion as to the method(s) for identifying, marking the location of, and protecting each plant and hardwood species listed as being either endangered, threatened, rare or commercially exploited.  
C.  A discussion as to how exotic plant and hardwood species will be treated (mechanical methods, controlled burn, and/or application of herbicides) at the site.  Minimal use of herbicides is encouraged.  Include a discussion as to which species will be removed from the site for offsite disposal and identify the off-site disposal site(s).   
D.  A list of the equipment which will be used to treat the exotic species at the site.
E.  A list of herbicides, with the manufacturer’s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSD) for each herbicide, which will be used for treatment of the exotic plant and hardwood species.  Include the estimated quantities of each herbicide that will be applied and their potential effect on non-targeted native species should spray-over occur.  Include method(s) which will be utilized to prevent spray-over and runoff of herbicides to adjacent properties.   
F.  A schedule as to when, how many visits, and the anticipated duration of each site visit, within twelve months of the date of contract award, to fully implement the work plan. 
G.  The contractor’s cost to develop and implement the work plan.  The cost shall include all labor, materials, and equipment to perform the work.
H.  A list of qualified contractor personnel who will be identifying exotic and protected plant and hardwood species at the site, and those supervising field site activities.  Include biographies for each qualified personnel performing the work.  Include copies of applicable licenses for personnel who are required under federal, state, or local regulation to maintain licenses in performance of their duties (e.g. herbicide applicator’s license).
I.  Copies of all licenses required to fully implement the work plan (e.g. operate equipment, transport materials, apply herbicides).       

Permits and Record Keeping: The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining all permits for the work and making all notifications, as required, to federal, state and local regulatory agencies prior to performing the work.  After the work is completed, the Contractor shall submit herbicide application records to the NOAA Contracting Officer and maintain records in accordance with the Florida Statutes, Chapter 487.160. 

Scheduled Site Visit: Prior to preparing and submitting a quotation, each Contractor is required to visit the site. Contact  Rusty Pfost, Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC) of the Miami Weather Forecast Office (WFO), at 305/229-4502 to schedule a site visit.   

Special Field Conditions: A Final Historical Records Review document, prepared by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. (November 2004), reports that the Perrine LTA was used for limited training activities by the U.S. Army Reserve Command between 1989 and 1999.  Training activities included a field hospital, foot patrol, and wheeled vehicle training with the potential for some blank ammunition training.  During site visits in April and June 2004, several blank small arms cartridges and one spent practice flare were observed.  If encountered, these items pose virtually no safety risk.  Although unlikely, it is possible that unexploded ordnance (UXO), discarded military munitions (DMM), and munitions constituents (MC) may be encountered.  For safety assurance, in the event any of the later items are encountered, the items should not be handled, and the NOAA Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) should be notified.

Contractor Services: The Contractor shall furnish all labor, material and equipment necessary for satisfactory contract performance.  Materials and equipment shall be of a suitable type and grade for the purpose.  All material, workmanship, and equipment shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the appointed NOAA site representative.  The Contractor shall supply NOAA with a list of chemicals to be used and a copy of certified herbicide applicators’ licenses. No contractor equipment or chemicals may be stored on the site overnight.  Specified services shall be completed to provide for the safety of NOAA staff and the general public.

Protection of Property: Precautions shall be exercised at all times for the protection of persons and property while performing work under this contract.  Contractor shall be responsible to repair or replace, to be determined by and to the satisfaction of NOAA, any item(s) damaged or destroyed by actions or omissions of the Contractor and/or related personnel on federal property. 

Coordination and Scheduling of Activities: The Contractor shall coordinate all activities in advance with the designated NOAA site representative.  In addition, the Contractor shall perform site activities only when favorable conditions exist for NOAA to achieve benefit from the activities, and when liabilities associated with the activities and damages to property can be reduced to a minimum.  All activities outlined in the work plan shall be completed within 12 months of the date of contract award. 

Technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by fax or by e-mail. You may submit your proposal by e-mail, fax, or by mail. Proposals must be received on or before close of business May 31, 2005.

The following evaluation factors will be employed for evaluating each contractor’s submitted work plan for the first year of removing and reducing the growth of exotic plant species and non-native hardwoods on the 10 acre Miami radar site.
1.  Method(s) for treating exotic plant species and non-native hardwoods, and identifying and protecting endangered plant species.  
2.   Qualifications of personnel overseeing and performing the work.

•	Case Studies:  Best practices of top performers in e-business and how to apply these best practices to the small and medium sized business. 

•	Provide feedback regarding each fellow’s own business situation.

•	During the fellowship, fellows will be required to develop an “E-Change Plan” for their company.  As part of the wrap up session fellows will present their e-change plan to the trainer and group for feedback.  (Fellows will be encouraged to bring their own laptops and may choose to conduct PowerPoint Presentations; however, Trainer will not be required to provide any sort of hardware to the fellows.)  During the initial training, the Trainer must present this assignment to the fellows.

•	Prepare fellows for completion of their assignment during the following weeks.

•	Establish format for developing individual “e-change” plans and discuss how to overcome the obstacles to e-change.

•	Prepare fellows to gain the most from the site visits.  E.g. steps they can take to implement an e-change plan once they return; leading discussions that help the fellows understanding the IT challenges that face them and identifying their IT priorities.

Schedule

Monday June 6: The trainer will provide a short, broad overview of e-business.  The Contractor will engage the fellows in a discussion about their “home business” goals and objectives and key management issues in the implementation of IT, while providing a context in which to view the upcoming days’ workshops and roundtables.  Trainer will also discuss the need to develop a technology related business plan and lay the groundwork for presentation on day 2 of assignment.  Past experience indicates that fellows are especially interested in case studies.

Tuesday June 7: The trainer will: 
1)	Lead fellows in a goal-oriented discussion on how to make the most of their time at the U.S. host companies.

2)	Present the fellows with a two-part assignment that they will work on during the next 2 1/2 weeks.  It is intended that the majority of their efforts will focus on Part 2 of the assignment.

Part 1:  The fellows will create an inventory of innovative uses of IT at the host companies, with a “best practices” focus.  Fellows will use this inventory to apply best practices to a clearly defined problem in their particular business.

Part 2:  The fellows will develop a plan for IT-related improvement/changes in their home companies.  The discussion should include a thorough exploration of 1) who the stakeholders are and their interests; 2) how to assess their home company’s IT-readiness; 3) issues to be considered in both developing and managing an IT-implementation plan.

Friday June 24 - Wrap-Up Session

Fellows will present Part 1 of their assignment to the trainer and the group of fellows.  Trainer will facilitate session.

The Contractor shall provide an oral evaluation of each fellow’s e-change presentation.  The evaluation will include a discussion of realistic measurable goals and timelines for fellows in accomplishing e-change.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source contract to Brodart Automation for the Corps of Engineers Library Information Online (CELIO) Database in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).  This is a combined synopsis/solicit ation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solici tation will not be issued.  Statement of Work CORPS OF ENGINEERS LIBRARY INFORMATION ONLINE (CELIO) Section I General Information A.  Purpose:  The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Technical Libraries have a requirement to maintain a database for electronic accounting and cataloging of facility holdings and to afford cost-effective automation of library information servi ces.  The Corps of Engineers Library Information Online (CELIO) Database is used as a means to meet this requirement, serving as the corporate repository of USACE technical library holdings.  Brodart Company of Williamsport, PA currently maintains this uni on list of approximately 562,635 holdings. B.  Background:  In 1997, the USACE Libraries converted to Brodarts LePac Public Access Catalog, using Brodarts hardware and software facilities.  Prior to the decision to move to Brodart for these library support services, an exhaustive study of the var ious options available to provide library automation was conducted.  From 1997, Brodart Co. has maintained the CELIO Database on its hardware in Williamsport, PA., using its own copyrighted and proprietary software.  USACE Libraries On-line Computer Libra ry Center (OCLC) derived-records updates are electronically transferred via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) into the system once a month. C.  Scope:  The CELIO Database maintained by Brodart Company is a service provided to all Corps of Engineers employees  importantly the engineers, scientists, and attorneys within the Corps.  The CELIO provides access to information holdings of all (appro ximately 41) USACE libraries, both individually and collectively, and contains approximately 562,635 holdings.  CELIO is available to all users from their desktop PCs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year via the Internet, and also provides USACE libraries with accountability of individual library holdings in accordance with AR 735-17. D.  Regulations and Guidelines: 	AR 735-17, Accounting for Library Materials 	DA Pam 25-96, The Army Library Program 	ER 25-1-96, The USACE Library Program 	ER 700-1-1, USACE Supply Policies and Procedures Section II Technical Information A.

The Dat abase must accept and maintain the full-bibliographic and site-specific holdings, identifying symbols, editions, copy numbers, specific library information and edited catalog data.  The Database must have the capability to import, store, and export Machine  Readable Catalog (MARC) records with complete integrity of structure (leader, record directory, and viable fields); content designation (tags, indicators, and subfields); and data content itself must be maintained.  The CELIO must be updated monthly or mo re often using the web-based FTP Protocol for OCLC derived records.  Holding records will be created for individual Corps libraries based on the code present in the 049 Field (OCLC Symbol) when electronic data are loaded into the vendors system.  When MAR C record data are entered via FTP electronically transferred OCLC derived records, the system must check for duplicate records by matching the OCLC Number.  When a duplicate bibliographic record is encountered, the system shall link a holding or copy of co py recor d to the existing bibliographic record.  The CELIO must support the capability to load, add, modify, and delete information pertinent to holdings so that the Online Catalog reflects the current holdings of the Corps libraries.  The Database must be searcha ble by author, title, and subject as a minimum and should support Boolean Logic.  The vendor must also offer library circulation as a subsystem to interested individual libraries in order for Corps libraries to maintain property accountability.  The vendor  will furnish required hardware and software to maintain this Union List.

Statement of Work

Train Network Management System Development-- Technical Support for Demonstrations of Locomotive Emergency Egress, Locomotive Security System and Advanced Concept Train


Overview of Train Demonstrations— Locomotive Emergency Egress, Advanced Concept Train and Locomotive Security System

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Research and Development proposes to build a five-car train to demonstrate new freight car technology systems that FRA has been developing during the past several years. The demonstration covers three areas from three separate program areas—Rolling Stock and Equipment, Train Occupant Protection and Train Security.  FRA has developed Emergency Egress concepts for locomotives. The roof hatch, removable windshield, detachable door hinge and the Automatic Collision Notification System were developed under the Train Occupant Protection Program to improve locomotive crew safety.  FRA proposes to demonstrate these concepts as part of the demonstrations.  The objective of the Advanced Concept Train (ACT) Project is to develop and demonstrate advanced systems for continuously monitoring and remotely controlling freight car mechanical components to improve freight rail transportation safety and efficiency. This includes the use of Electrically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) Braking.  The program is part of the Rolling Stock Program Element in FRA's Five-Year Strategic Plan for Railroad Research, Development and Demonstrations.  The Locomotive Security System (LSS) is part of the Train Security Program.  The objective of the LSS is to develop and demonstrate advanced concepts to prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives.

During FY 2003 FRA purchased an EMD GP40-3 EM2000 computer controlled locomotive for these projects.   FRA proposes to acquire five freight cars on loan from co-operating railroads for the Advanced Concept Train Demonstration projects. The five freight cars will be equipped with sensors to monitor the following components:

·	Bearings (vibration signature and temperature)
·	Trucks (ride quality and hunting)
·	Wheels (flat and out-of-round)
·	Brakes (piston travel)
·	Car Ride Quality (all three directions)

The freight cars will also be equipped with actuators to remotely control the following components:

·	Coupler
·	Cut-levers
·	Angle-cocks
·	Advanced cushioning device
·	Advanced handbrake

The FRA also plans to equip the ACT locomotive and freight cars with stand alone hard-wired AAR S-4200 compliant Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes.  FRA purchased New York Air Brake’s EP-60 ECP brakes along with locomotive CCB-II brakes to control braking. FRA also plans to upgrade the locomotive to provide locomotive systems for on-board monitoring for safe and efficient maintenance and operation. The ACT locomotive (GP-40-3) will be modified to incorporate a Locomotive Security System (LSS).

An IEEE 802-11b based two-way wireless intra-train communication system will link the freight cars to the locomotive. The communication system enables the freight cars to transmit safety alarms and status information to the locomotive and to receive commands and information requests from the locomotive. When a defect affecting train safety is detected, a safety alarm will be sent to the locomotive to alert the engineer.  Non-critical defects detected during normal operations are flagged and reported for maintenance. The freight car sensor data will also be linked to a remote database server through a wireless telecommunications system.  The database server will be accessible via the Internet.  FRA currently has five cars equipped with the on-board monitoring system operating in a revenue service demonstration in co-operation with Southern Company and Norfolk Southern Corporation.  The experience gained with that demonstration will be extended to the ACT.

Integrating Locomotive Display/Computer Systems with ECP Braking and the ACT Monitoring and Control System

FRA has reviewed available locomotive computer systems for use in the ACT Demonstration Project. The FRA GP-40-3 locomotive is an Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) built locomotive with the EM-2000 computer. The EMD Functionally Integrated Railway Electronics (FIRE) locomotive display and cab computer with integrated Communications Management Unit (CMU) and IntelliTrain remote monitoring system is uniquely qualified to support the FRA ACT project.  The FIRE locomotive display and cab computer is built on a Microsoft Windows embedded XP platform and is designed to operate in the locomotive cab environment.  The FIRE computer uses an EMD proprietary inter-process communication protocol known as NetCore, which is based on a TCP/IP network socket bus architecture.  The FIRE computer CMU supports numerous wireless communications technologies, including 1xRTT and GPRS packet switched cellular, CDMA circuit switched cellular, and 802.11b wireless LAN.  The FIRE computer integrated CMU and NetCore messaging protocol is employed to seamlessly exchange data between the locomotive and remote databases.  EMD has created a FIRE Developer’s Kit (FDK) that provides a set of tools to support development of third party applications for the FIRE locomotive display and cab computer. The FDK will facilitate development of software for the ACT demonstration.

In view of the above FRA is seeking a contractor to support the ACT development team in developing the necessary software and to provide related technical support to install the software on the locomotive FIRE computers installed on the FRA GP-40-3 locomotive. The required software and its function for each of the specific tasks are described in detail below:

TASKS

Task 1: Train Network Management System Development for Actuator Remote Control and On-Board Sensor Monitoring

a) Messaging Protocol Development for communication between the freight cars and the locomotive FIRE computer and locomotive applications 

The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing a messaging system for two-way communication between the locomotive and the freight cars and between the locomotive and remote database servers.  The messaging system will be based on an open protocol such as Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS).  The messaging system software shall run on the FIRE computer to support operation of various graphical user interfaces for controlling advanced components and displaying monitoring system data and two-way messaging between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.
b) Graphical User Interfaces on Locomotive FIRE computers
The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) on the FIRE computer to control the advanced components (hand brakes, cut levers, angle cocks, etc.) and display information from the passive monitoring system.
c) Transmitting OBMCS (sensor) data to web accessible database server
The contractor shall develop software for the locomotive FIRE computers to transmit car sensor data and pertinent locomotive data (locomotive health status, fuel data, asset tracking) to a web accessible database server when required. The On-Board Monitoring and Control System also provides a direct path to the web accessible database server.  The software shall use the messaging system developed in a).
d) ACT Hazard Analysis
The contractor shall provide engineering technical support to assist with conducting a hazard analysis of the ACT system, particularly the intra-train wireless communication system between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.  A report describing the Hazard Analysis shall be written and submitted to the FRA.

Task 2:  Locomotive Security System

In recent times there has been a heightened concern about railroad security in the US.  One area of particular concern is the vulnerability of locomotives and trains to operation by unauthorized individuals and the potential use of a train as a terrorist weapon.  It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stop a loaded train carrying hazardous material, going 70 MPH, in a populated urban area by any means other than by derailing it.  At the very least, this would result in significant property damage and be extremely disruptive to America’s railroad transportation system. FRA, has identified the risk of using a locomotive/train as a terrorist weapon and the unique challenge faced by the railroads to secure their locomotives and infrastructure.

Because many different personnel operate locomotives and they are often interchanged between railroads, locomotives are not equipped with an ignition key like an automobile.  Instead, locomotives are equipped with a universal removable "Reverser" handle that is mechanically interlocked with the locomotive "Throttle" handle.  The "Reverser" handle is inserted into a slot in the locomotive controller mechanism in order to operate the locomotive. Because the "Reverser" handle is designed to be interchangeable between locomotives, a lost, misplaced, stolen or duplicated "Reverser" handle could be used by an unauthorized individual to operate any standard freight or passenger locomotive in North America.  Locomotive cabs are also equipped with door locks, however they are seldom used, especially when the locomotives are being operated.  In any case, they would provide little protection against an armed terrorist determined to hijack a locomotive.

To address these security risks and prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives, FRA would like to develop and demonstrate a Locomotive Security System.  The system, as envisioned, would utilize electronic ID technology, such as SmartCards, to authenticate the identity of a certified locomotive engineer/operator.  If the operator fails to authenticate properly, a full service penalty brake would be initiated by the LSS to stop the train and prevent operation of the locomotive The contractor shall develop a prototype system for application to the FRA Advanced Concept Train Locomotive. The contractor shall provide technical support to install, test and verify operation of the LSS. 

Locomotive Security System Concept

The LSS, as envisioned, would use an electronic ID (e.g. smartcard) to prevent unauthorized operation of a locomotive.  In the basic embodiment of the system, authorized locomotive operators would be issued an electronic ID and their own unique PIN.  The PIN is encrypted so that the ID card can not be duplicated if lost or stolen.  The locomotive would be equipped with an electronic ID card reader and keypad.  The electronic ID card readerwould interface to the LSS computer.  The LSS computer would  prevent operation of the locomotive unless a valid PIN is entered by the locomotive operator. A functional discussion follows.

Each time the locomotive comes to a stop, the locomotive operator must enter his PIN before the LSS computer will allow the locomotive to be operated.  While the locomotive is moving, the locomotive operator must periodically enter his PIN.  If the locomotive operator fails to enter the correct PIN, the LSS computer will send a signal to the locomotive airbrake system to initiate a penalty brake application.  A penalty brake application will result in removal of locomotive traction power and the reduction of brake pipe pressure to zero psi at a service rate.  

An optional distress message can automatically be transmitted to alert authorities of unauthorized locomotive operation when an incorrect PIN is entered or when a special PIN is entered (e.g. backward PIN).

In another embodiment of this invention, operator biometric information (e.g. fingerprint) is stored on the electronic ID.  The locomotive is equipped with an electronic ID card reader and corresponding biometric scanner (e.g. fingerprint reader).  The operation is identical to that described above using a PIN to authenticate locomotive operation except that a biometric scan is conducted instead of a PIN being entered by the operator. Periodic reaffirmation can be incorporated with the ALERTER system. The handle may be equipped with a fingerprint scanner which will allow the locomotive engineer/operator continuing authentication. 

As part of this work, the FRA GP40-3 locomotive shall be equipped with an Electro-Motive FIRE™ Locomotive Cab Computer and Display (LCC&D).  FRA proposes to further utilize this locomotive to implement a prototype LSS with capabilities to use either a PIN or a fingerprint for operator authentication.

The proposed locomotive security system shall use an electronic ID card that contains the operator’s encrypted personal identification number (PIN) and fingerprint information.  The locomotive security system shall be integrated with the brake system.  The locomotive will be equipped with both an electronic ID card reader and a finger print scanner.  The FIRE™ computer shall be used to implement the LSS algorithms and for operator PIN input.  

The operator must insert his/her ID card into the electronic ID card reader and input his/her PIN, or place his/her index finger on the fingerprint scanner, before operating the locomotive.  If the operator does not enter the correct PIN, or the fingerprint authentication fails, the locomotive security system will initiate a full service penalty brake application.  During operation of the locomotive, the operator will be asked to periodically enter his/her PIN into the system or place their finger on the fingerprint scanner in order to prevent a penalty brake application from being activated by the LSS.

A task report describing the Locomotive Security System shall be prepared and delivered to FRA for review and comment. This report shall be revised and submitted for final distribution. The prototype hardware shall be delivered for installation and support provided for installation of the same.

Deliverables

Task Deliverables 

The contractor shall document and make available to FRA all applicable software developed as part of this work. The rights to use any proprietary software incorporated into the Train Network System shall be granted to the Government.  The deliverables for each task are listed with each task.
