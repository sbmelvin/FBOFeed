In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical, and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.

An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.

This market survey is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAAs) Acquisition Management System (AMS) for Oceanic Data Link (ODL) Telecommunications System/Service.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and must not be construed as a commitment or a promise to contract by the Government.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.

In order to respond to this effort interested parties must have an existing system that is fully capable of meeting all of the FAA's immediate requirements.

The ODL Telecommunications System/Service consists of routing and delivery of messages used in the provision of Air Traffic Control (ATC) services, which originate from and are addressed to FAA ATC automation systems.

This service must be provided to the New York, Oakland and Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC), the William J Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC).  The service supports Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP), Flight Data Processor (FDP2000) system, and Future Air Navigation System (FANS 1/A) aircraft.

The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing: Message Routing and Delivery service and Network Access for ODL Telecommunications System/Service using Common Message Handling Protocol (CMHP)/TCP/IP.  Vendors must demonstrate that they have the following capabilities/knowledge:

Provide Hardware and Software equipment/infrastructure including satellite network service for an ODL Telecommunications service/system.
-   Engineering and Maintenance services for ODL equipment.
-   Provide technical support for Interface Testing of the ATOP and FDP2000 systems.
-   Knowledge of the existing ODL FAA system and interfaces

The proposed contract may also include a Task Order requirement for Engineering and Technical Support service for assisting any HW or SW Architecture and Information System Security modifications.  This activity would be ordered on an as needed basis utilizing the Time and Materials CLIN.


The value for this requirement is roughly estimated to be between $700,000 to $1,000,000 for one (1) base year and six (6) option years. 

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from all interested firms that are capable of providing ODL Telecommunications System/Service.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541990, with a size standard of $7.0 million.   

Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments.  Interested parties must provide:

1.	Two (2) copies of the capabilities/knowledge summary not to exceed eight (8)   
       pages, and

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the renewal of SOLHID user licenses for maintenance of equipment and software located in William J. Hughes Technical Center and Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center.

SOLHID - Solaris Host Interface Device, BTI DBG, HID 370 - Channel Software, HID - Device Drivers, and HID - Firmware Emulation are Sunhillo products used on the User Request Evaluation Tool. This product is only offered and maintained by Sunhillo Corporation.

The FAA contemplates awarding a purchase order to fulfill this requirement, with a period of performance of 3/31/2014 - 3/30/2015. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services.

The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only Sunhillo Corporation. West Berlin, NJ, in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.

The FAA currently receives support from Sunhillo for these products.  The determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm is necessitated due to the complex nature of the products requiring support, the unique combination of products requiring support, requirement for a single vendor to provide support at multiple locations, and required continuity of support for these products.
  
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any questions or inquiries resulting from this announcement shall be addressed to William Bleda, Contracting Officer, at email William.Bleda@faa.gov. 

This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<p><strong>Description<br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), is anticipating to award a Firm-Fixed Price non-competitive purchase order to the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute in Cleveland, Ohio to provide assays of TMAO, carnitine, and Choline for 1500 samples obtained from the ongoing ATBC trials. Because this order is to continue on-going research already being performed by the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute is the only source capable of fulfilling this requirement.</p>
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $14 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br />There is convincing evidence for a role of red and processed meat in colorectal cancer, but the mechanisms underlying the association between red/processed meat and colorectal cancer are not clear. Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the U.S. Elucidating the mechanism underlying the association between red/processed meat and colorectal cancer may help to identify intervention targets, which could reduce colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality. Recent studies demonstrated that trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is produced from choline and carnitine, compounds found in large quantities in red/processed meat and produced by gut bacteria. Moreover, TMAO is associated with cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and inflammation. NCI proposes that gut microbiota may be a major determinant in modifying colorectal cancer risk associated with red/processed meat intake via TMAO production. TMAO and the gut microbiota may account for inconsistent results from past studies, and may highlight the mechanism by which red/processed meat is associated with colorectal cancer. TMAO has been associated with increased inflammatory markers, which may impact cancer risk, and may also contribute to formation of the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute will assess whether carnitine/choline and TMAO are associated with colorectal cancer in a case-cohort study nested in the ongoing Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Trial (ATBC). Our primary aim is to determine the association between TMAO, as a potential integrative measure of red/processed meat intake and the gut microbiota, and colorectal cancer. The overarching goal is to provide insight into the mechanism underlying the association between red/processed meat intake and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives of the Procurement</strong><br />This procurement will assess the role of carnitine/choline and TMAO in risk of colorectal cancer by assaying these compounds in sera in a case-cohort study nested within the ATBC Trial which is ongoing at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute. This procurement will utilize serum samples from ~750 colorectal cancer cases and 750 controls in ATBC. Assays will be completed in Dr. Hazen's laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic, which has extensive expertise in TMAO plasma measurements. Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute will measure serum carnitine, choline, and TMAO. TMAO will be measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), the gold standard method for measuring TMAO. The Hazen laboratory already has panels set up to assay TMAO and many other analytes with this method. Choline and carnitine will be analyzed by stable isotope dilution LC/MS/MS analyses using established methods. For all assays, the laboratory will be blinded to case-cohort status. Each batch will include an equal distribution of colorectal cancer cases and disease-free individuals. 10% of the batch will include quality control samples used to calculate assay coefficients of variation.</p>
<p>Our primary aim is to determine the main effects of TMAO on colorectal cancer. In order to fully explore this association, this procurement will also investigate the associations between serum precursors of TMAO (carnitine, choline) and the disease endpoint.</p>
<p>Secondary aims are to:<br />1. Since TMAO is a biomarker only recently studied in relation to any disease, we will explore the associations that are related to the proposed role of TMAO in colorectal cancer. Specifically, this procurement will investigate the association between meat intake and serum metabolites (TMAO, carnitine, choline). This procurement will also explore the interrelationship between plasma TMAO, carnitine, and choline. Lastly, this procurement will determine whether there is an association between meat intake and colorectal cancer in the overall ATBC cohort (~29,000 men; ~ 825 cases) as well as the subset in which TMAO will be measured (~700 cases).<br />2. Investigate, in an exploratory analysis, whether TMAO is a mediator of the association between red/processed meat and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Requirements</strong><br />The contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br />1. Receive and catalog approximately 1500 serum samples. The receipt of biologic samples should be logged in a MS Excel file including the information of ID, amount of serum received, and date of receipt. To facilitate this, an excel file will be provided by the Government and will include: sample ID and volume provided. The Contractor will add the date of receipt, an internal ID, test/assay date, and values for each serum measurement of interest.<br />2. Analyze carnitine, choline, and TMAO in 1500 serum samples using LC/MS/MS and record the results in the Excel file above.<br />3. Provide a plan for determining if the replicate values are in agreement and for repeat duplicates, as needed. Any insurmountable problems in the analysis of samples shall be reported to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within three days of when they happen.<br />4. Send data to the NCI.<br />5. The dates of service will extend 5.5 months from the date of award (estimated period of performance is 05/01/2014-10/15/2014).</p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.

<a href="mailto:Fuchs.Samantha@epamail.epa.gov">Samantha Fuchs</a>
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Thermo Electron North America, LLC, A  firm-fixed-price Purchase Order for a Modular Autosampler and an Ultra-High Pressure Dual Pump Liquid Chromatograph (UHPLC).
The EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), Water Supply and Water Resources Division (WSWRD), at  AWBERC , 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH  45268 requires that the instruments listed below must be able to integrate with existing instrumentation that is controlled by proprietary software of Thermo Electron, North America to ensure consistency among research projects vital to NRMRL's mission.  The EPA has identified Thermo Electron North America, LLC as the only contractor able to meet the requirements of this procurement.  
The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capabilities to supply a Modular Autosampler and Ultra-High Pressure Dual Pump Liquid Chromatograph (UHPLC) that is compatible with the EPA's current Thermo Accela Ultra-High Pressure Liquid Chromatograph and High Resolution Accurate Mass Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer.  The existing system is controlled by proprietary software that is uniquely capable for controlling the final integrated instrumentation.  Instrumentation and required software is proprietary to a single manufacturer and cannot be supplied by any other manufacturer.  The two instruments being procured must be able to perform analysis on a multitude of sample matrices and deliver measureable results compliant with the needs for the research performed by WSWRD.  These unique capabilities are essential for contract performance because they allow WSWRD to continue support on research essential to the WSWRD mission.  A market survey revealed  that this assemblage of instrumentation cannot be gotten through another manufacturer due to the proprietary integration of the Autosampler and UHPLC Dual Pump system with the current instrumentation it will compliment. Thermo Electron North America, LLC is the only source for the purchase of a Modular Autosampler and an Ultra-High Pressure Dual Pump Liquid Chromatograph (UHPLC) that is compatible with a Thermo Accela Ultra-High Pressure Liquid Chromatograph and High Resolution Accurate Mass Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer. WSWRD is in need of this equipment for performing in-house research requiring analysis of analytes at environmentally-relevant concentrations.  A wide range of sample matrices are expected to be analyzed, including suspended particulate material, aqueous phase samples and wastewater sludges.  This unit is expected to fully automate sample preparation through on-line solid-phase extraction, sample preparation and the flexibility for future upgrades (modular design).  The instrument will considerably shorten the preparation time and minimize the number man-hours currently required.  Samples are to be analyzed for a wide range of organic compounds requiring multiple extraction me thodologies, most of which are quite cumbersome to perform.  This unit will supplement the current facility abilities to perform analytical support to the division and other U.S. EPA entities.  Several example research projects requiring the use of such equipment include drinking/wastewater field study analysis of organic compounds including pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupting compounds, algaltoxins and other contaminants of emerging concern.  The division has committed resources in the study of wastewater, wastewater sludge and sediment research focusing on these target analytes and expect to expand these in the future.  This instrumentation is to be utilized to satisfy project tasks covered under the Path Forward Initiative (RAP SSWR 5.2c) requiring task output material.  In accordance to our particular needs, the following unit specifications will be required to successfully and satisfactory meet our institutional requirements:
1.	One Modular Autosampler: i.	Modular design to allow flexibility and future upgradability; ii.	Capable of large-volume injections up to a minimum 20 mL; iii.	Capable of multiple sampling from a single vial into a injection loop; iv.	Capable of injecting standard non-preconcentrated samples or incorporate an integrated solid-phase extraction preconcentration column with the same autosampler without changing any plumbing connections; v.	Capable to injection volumes between 0.001-20 mL; vi.	Temperature controlled sample storage compartment; vii.	Capable of automated injection into multiple injection ports; viii.	At least three integrated switching values; ix.	At least one switching values must be compatible with pressures exceeding 12500 psi; x.	Ability to pre-inject sample into preparatory on-line Solid-Phase Extraction column prior to the completion of the analytical measurement.
2.	One Ultra-High Pressure Liquid Chromatograph System: i.	Ultra-High Pressure Quaternary Pump 1.	Pressures up to 15000 psi; 2.	Flow rates adjustable between 0.001?8 mL/min; 3.	Solvent degasser; 4.	Solvent mixing to up to 4 separate mobile phases. ii.	One High Performance Quaternary Pump: 1.	Pressures up to 9000 psi; 2.	4-channel solvent degasser; 3.	Solvent mixing for up to 4 separate mobile phases; 4.	Flow rates adjustable between 0.001 ? 10 mL/min. iii.	One Temperature-controlled Column Compartment: 1.	Operate at a range of temperatures between 5oC to 110 oC; 2.	Operate at pressures up to 15,000 psi; 3.	Post-column cooling; 4.	Accommodate at least to 10 columns. 3.	Full integration with Thermo Accela Ultra-High Pressure Liquid Chromatograph and High Resolution Accurate Mass Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer; 4.	Technical support for installation; 5.	Include a minimum 1 year manufacturer warranty; 6.	Ability to integrate and full-function control with Thermo XCalibur Software.
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures.  It is our intent to award a single fixed-price purchase order. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. EPA anticipates awarding the resultant order March 13, 2014. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Belvoir Division (ACC-APG Belvoir) on behalf of the US Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) is conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. Responders to this Request for Information (RFI) are asked to provide their technical capability information (aka Statement of Capabilities) required to perform the requirements provided below.  Statements should address the specific requirements of this notice and identify the vendors' specific capability to complete these requirements, including, but not limited to a description of corporate experience with similar projects and information on applicable industry certifications at the individual and organizational level as well as describing investments in quality/process improvement activities.  <br>  <br> NVESD wishes to identify state of the art technology, within government, industry, and academia, for algorithm development to support the ongoing development chemical sensing technology.  <br> NVESD is seeking the development of algorithm that will use fluorescence intensity data from an already existing cross-reactive array sensor to identify chemicals targets. The currently being developed sensor outputs between 6 and 30 channels of data. The algorithm is expected to recognize patterns from these output channels and use them to identify chemical targets. Data from laboratory experiments will be provided to generate a library of known chemicals. The algorithm should have the ability to distinguish components in a mixture from the known chemicals in the library. The algorithm will also need to be adaptable allowing the addition of new chemicals to the library. The algorithm will need to operate on the raw data from the existing sensor which is output in a documented binary format with already developed readers in Matlab, Python, and Perl.  <br> The Government is particularly interested in the application of successful pattern matching schemes to this research from other research areas such as genomics, proteomics, and analysis of the financial markets.  <br> The Government requests that interested offerors submit an electronic response of not more than twenty (20) pages, 8.5 quote mark  x 11 quote mark  paper, 12 pitch, Times New Roman font, with a minimum of one (1) inch margins all around.

Responses should also include the company name, CAGE code, point of contact, and address. All information received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis that is marked  quote mark Proprietary quote mark  will be handled accordingly. Responses will not be returned.  <br> Provide answers to the following questions (No more than 3 pages)(Not included in the above 20 page limit). <br>  <br> 1.	If you identify your company as a Small Business or any of the SB subcategories, is your company interested in a prime contract?  <br> 2.	Under the current SB recertification regulations, do you anticipate your company remaining a small business, under primary NAICS Code 541712? <br> 3.	Does your company possess the capabilities to provide the entire range of services called for in the above task list? <br>  <br> ______ YES _______ NO <br> 4.	 If you answered YES to Question # 3, please provide specific capabilities and examples for how your company can provide these services.  <br> 5.	If you answered NO to Question # 3, please list what services in the RFI your company can provide? Please provide specific capabilities and examples. <br> 6.	Does your firm possess an approved Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) accounting system? <br>  <br> 7.	Does your company meet the Non-manufacturing Rule? If so How? <br> 8.	If you are a small business how do you select your partners and/or subcontractors? <br> Responses are due no later than 24 April 2014, 10 am Eastern Time (ET). Email responses should not exceed 5 Megabytes (MB).  <br> Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. The Army does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Respondents should not construe this synopsis as a commitment for any purpose. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments.

The space must be contiguous; on no more than one floor (street level preferable) and must not exceed 6500 usable square feet. The space must be handicapped accessible, ADA compliant, and can be provided by new construction or modification of an existing space. 

The space must meet or be able to meet the Department of Veterans Affairs Life and Fire Safety, Seismic and Sustainability Standards and other applicable regulations.  A five (5) year lease with an option to renew for an additional one (1) 5-year option period will be considered.  The VA seeks a modified gross lease that includes, but not limited to the following:

Only space that is identified as economically advantageous to the Government will be considered relative to relocation, potential build out and/or rent. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. A cost comparison will be performed in relation to the expenses incurred at the current location.

A market survey of the properties offered for lease will be conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs. All interested offerors (owners, brokers, or their legal representatives) must provide written acknowledgement NO LATER THAN Monday, March 24, 2014 4:30pm EST. 

Additional requirements include:

The Government is limited by law (41 C.F.R. 102-73.55) to pay no more than the appraised fair market rental value for space. 

Expressions of interest shall include the following:
Building name, address and age

Rentable Square Feet (RSF) available and expected rental rate per RSF

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 621511 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is $30 Million.
<p><strong>A. Background<br /></strong>In clinical protocol 14-AT-0054, we are measuring group differences in baseline salivary cortisol levels over time, as well as salivary cortisol levels in response to experimental tasks. Both measures are important for understanding hypothalamo-pituitary axis function in yoga practitioners versus control subjects. For this project, we will collect 35 saliva samples/person for the baseline cortisol measure and 7 saliva samples/person during the experimental task. We will be testing a maximum of 98 subjects, and therefore will collect and analyze up to a total of 4116 saliva samples. In the event that our primary outcome reaches significance before all 98 participants have been tested, we may terminate the study early.</p>
<p>The National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is anticipating to award a firm-fixed price competitive purchase order for the necessary supplies and cortisol saliva analysis of 4,116 samples over a two-year period.</p>
<p><strong>B. Purpose and Objectives of the Procurement</strong><br />Provide a source of clinical grade supplies and equipment and provide a qualified testing facility capable of analyzing a large volume of samples (4,116) over a period of 2 years while maintaining a high level of accuracy in testing and reliable and repeatable analysis. The contractor shall be required to;<br />1. Provide supplies (swabs, storage tubes with coded labels, cryogenic storage boxes and dry-ice shipment boxes). Swabs are preferred over passive drool sampling as the latter often leads to under-sampling and inaccuracies. Passive sampling is particularly problematic when the samples are acquired at home, like most of the samples in the current study, as the researcher cannot correct the participant if under-sampling has occurred.<br />2. Be able to perform testing on samples received in multiple shipments, as the samples can be altered if frozen for long periods of time. Saliva samples will be stored at the NIH in -80 C freezers. Collection tubes can only survive in the freezer for 6 months, therefore it is extremely important that we have flexibility in how many samples we can send for out testing services at a time. <br />3. Provide the highest accuracy in testing: Cortisol is assayed using a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay and the samples should be assayed in duplicate for at least part of the sampling to determine accuracy. We need the samples tested at least to include 85% singlet testing and 15% in duplicate testing (i.e. two test results per sample), (see attached Granger paper, Incorporating Salivary Biomarkers Into Nursing Research: An Overview and Review of Best Practices). We need the company to provide an average intra-assay coefficient of variation &lt;5%, and because testing of 4,116 samples will require numerous assays, we need the company to provide an average inter-assay coefficient of variation &lt;6%. The higher the coefficients the less accurate the testing.<br />4. Provide a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) certified testing facility. U.S. regulations created to provide quality standards for laboratory testing to ensure accuracy, reliability and timeliness of test results.</p>
<p><strong>C. Contractor Requirements<br /></strong>To be deemed capable of providing the current need the organization must submit a written tailored capability statement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise:</p>
<p>Personnel/Experience:<br />a. Proven organizational and past experience in salivary cortisol analysis.<br />b. The organization shall provide the name of the Principal Investigator, his/her professional qualifications and specific experience as a key investigator in cortisol saliva analysis.<br />c. The organization shall demonstrate that the proposed team and staff have previous successful experience in carrying out the requirements of the services stated herein.<br />Facilities: Adequacy of facilities for performing the Statement of Work. The organization shall provide evidence of CLIA certification and testing accuracy standards.</p>
<p>If any responsible source believes it can perform the requirements they may submit their capability statements via email (PDF format; 15 Page Limit, these pages exclude resumes) for consideration by NCI to Brenda Oberholzer, Contracting Officer, at oberholzerb@mail.nih.gov by the 12 pm ET, March 17, 2014. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>Respondents must include DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZONE, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code.</p>

The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business social-economic set-aside, competitive or non-competitive method is possible, and to determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>ALL organizations with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 541711 - Biomedical Research and Development and the associated small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The purpose of this requirement is to test the effects of levetiracetam, alone and in combination with donepezil on memory in young and aged rhesus monkeys for the National Institute of Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program (IRP).</p>
<p>Background Information:<br />The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) maintains a broad, multidisciplinary scientific program of investigator-initiated research aimed at understanding the basis of aging, and the development of strategies to promote optimally healthy aging. In support of the IRP's mission, the Neurocognitive Aging Section (NAS) in the Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience (LBN) conducts research in a variety of preclinical animal models, including nonhuman primates, in order to determine the basis of memory Impairment and sparing in aging, and to test interventions that might support successful cognitive aging.</p>
<p>Research in animal models and humans has revealed a number of features of brain aging that provide tractable targets for pharmacological intervention aimed at reversing or preventing age-related memory impairment. For example, aged rats with deficits in memory that requires the hippocampus exhibit abnormally high rates of neuronal firing in a key component of hippocampal circuitry. One interpretation is that this increased activity reflects a failed compensatory response to other changes in the aged brain.&nbsp; Alternatively, aberrant increases in neuronal firing may directly contribute to impaired hippocampal information processing and age-related deficits in memory. Consistent with the latter interpretation, the administration of drugs that reduce excess hippocampal activity both reverse the behavioral deficits seen in memory-impaired aged rats, and rescue other neurobiological correlates of impairment. Notably, corresponding benefits, measured by neuropsychological testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been reported in patients with mild cognitive impairment, i.e., a risk<br />factor for Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive aging is also accompanied by a variety of cholinergic abnormalities, and although all currently approved pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) target this neurochemical system, they yield at most only modest, transient delay in decline among a subset of patients. Considerate Interests centers on combination therapies that might improve the response to drugs currently in use for AD.</p>
<p>The successful contractor will provide all animals, animal support, behavioral testing equipment, and personnel to test in a nonhuman primate model whether pharmacological intervention aimed at reducing excessive neuronal activity, alone or in combination with an acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor approved for use in the symptomatic of AD, reverses cognitive impairment in older monkeys with memory deficits.</p>

<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business social-economic set-aside, competitive or non-competitive method is possible, and to determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>ALL organizations with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 5416920 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services and the associated small business size standard of $14.0<br /><br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The purpose of this requirement is conduct data analysis for Subclinical Vascular Disease and Change in Neurocognition in the Health Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Lifespan (HANDLS) Study for the National Institute of Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program (IRP)</p>
<p>Background information. The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study examines age-related health disparities in overall health and specific problems, and concerns in representative residents of communities throughout Baltimore. The purpose of the study is to understand some of the diseases related to aging in African Americans and whites in Baltimore. Little is known about the connection between age-associated cognitive change and the interaction between race and socioeconomic status. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as high blood pressure also create risks for stroke and other changes in the brain that may yield premature declines in cognitive performance. Subclinical CVDs, such as atherosclerosis and arterial stiffening, are pre-cursors to clinical CVD that occur without overt symptoms, yet can confer as much, if not more, risk for cognitive decline than traditional CVD risk factors. Subclinical CVDs are more prominent among ethnic minorities and those living in poverty, and may be an important explanatory factor in disparities in cognitive functioning. Repeated assessments of neurocognitive performance in the ongoing Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study address these issues. There are little data in the literature on the connection between subclinical CVD, cognitive performance, and brain structure. Furthermore, it is unknown whether these measures are related with age, sex, race, or povet1y status, the four main design elements of HANDLS. Overall, we expect participants with greater subclinical vascular disease will have significantly accelerated cognitive decline and MRl-assessed subclinical brain pathology, and that these associations will be most pronounced among African Americans and persons living in poverty.</p>
<p>The successful contractor will provide resources and expertise necessary to analyze HANDLS data to examine longitudinal changes in neurocognition as a function disparities associated with socioeconomic and racial differences.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice.
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, is seeking to replace the coating on a Poe Lock miter gate at the Soo Locks in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The rigid schedule and timeframe for the project is approximately 8 weeks from January to March in 2015 due to winter Lock closure and dewatering activities for lock maintenance. Project delays that cause the project to extend past the required completion date would adversely impact the commercial navigation industry and time extensions will not be granted. The miter gate is composed of two leafs, each approximately 63' wide by 57' tall. The gate will remain in place and would require a wind resistant, enclosed, climate controlled environment with a minimum temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit to be constructed around it. It is critical that the surface preparation meets "white metal" in accordance with SSPC SP 1 criteria and that stringent full time technically qualified quality control is maintained during surface preparation and coating application. Welding repairs to all cracked, pitted, or damaged gate surfaces after surface preparation activities will be required. The coating is an USACE exclusive marine grade vinyl based coating that shall be applied immediately after welding repairs and final surface preparation activities.</p>
<p>The contractor will have to be a Society of Protective Coatings (SSPC) certified painting contractor and the painters will have to provide third party certification as qualified paint applicators. Some disassembly and reassembly of existing/new replacement gate components will be required, including steam lines, grease lines, electrical conductors and signal lights, walkway platform and hand rail, timber fenders, structural stressing diagonals, gate seals, and access hatch. New timber fenders will be Government furnished, however, they will require augering for mounting bolts and some custom reshaping for fit. New diagonal straps would be Government furnished, but would will require Contractor surface prep, coating application, installation, and gate stressing (gate stressing by others). Protection of the gate anchorages, quoin blocks, miter blocks, hydraulic cylinder and connection, and pintles will be required throughout the project. Steam and electrical will be provided by the Government, however natural gas be provided by the Contractor if necessary. Limited staging area will be provided adjacent to the lock and a bridge barge would be in place across the Macarthur Lock only during winter closure. Any cranes and equipment required will be the responsibility of the Contractor. The purpose of this synopsis is to determine the interest, capability, and availability of qualified contractors to perform these services.</p>
<p>The estimated price range is between $1 Million and $5 Million.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 238320, which has a small business size standard of $14 million in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>This is NOT a request for proposal. This announcement is for planning purposes only. ALL qualified firms (small business, service disabled veteran owned businesses, HUBZone firms, Woman Owned, 8(a) firms and large businesses) are encouraged to respond. The response to this notice shall be in summary format and shall not exceed 12 pages. Do NOT send an SF 330. Responses shall include:</p>

<p>(2) If applicable, identification and verification of the company as a Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, subject to verification by the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>(3) A letter from the firm's bonding company verifying its total bonding capability (construction bonding level per contract and aggregate construction bonding level, both expressed in dollars).</p>
<p>(4) Past Experience - A list of the last five coating projects completed, to include contract number, award date, dollar value of contract, project location, and point of contact with contact information.</p>
<p>(5) Capacity to perform, to include geographic span, logistics and schedule complexity, and project size.</p>
<p>(6) Whether or not your firm has SSPC certifications and what types.</p>
<p>(7) Whether or not your firm has qualified in house scheduling and logistics management.</p>
<p><br />Qualified companies, regardless of their size or socio-economic status, are encouraged to respond. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought notice or Government use of any information provided. The Government will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments.

<DESC> <br> Labor Market Survey: In addressing projects within the scope of Executive Order 13502, USACE districts will need to undertake a labor market survey as part of their PLA evaluation process. USACE district PDTs should consider the following: <br>  <br> 1. Issuing a Sources Sought Notice: <br> The Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project: <br>  <br> Dredging and Beachfill, Delaware River Main Channel Deepening, Pennsylvania, New Jersey & Delaware  <br>  <br> Project Description: Contract work will consist of new work dredging within the Delaware River main navigation channel and placement of the dredged material on Broadkill Beach, Delaware for nourishment of the existing beach and dune system.  The proposed work will also include: <br>  <br>  	Dredging of the Miah Maull and Brandywine Ranges of the Delaware River Main Channel;  <br>  	Dredging shall be required to a depth of 45 feet MLLW plus 1-foot allowable over depth within the contract work limits;  <br>  	The side slope requirements for this project are 3H to 1V within the contract work limits;  <br>  	Beachfill work shall include the placement of approximately 1,900,000 cubic yards of dredged material covering a total of approximately 15,000 linear feet of beach;  <br>  	All material for the beachfill work shall be obtained from the Delaware River Main Channel; <br>  	Award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds. <br>  <br> Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00 <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are: <br>  <br> a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br> b. The complexity of the project.  <br> c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br> d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br> e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area. <br> f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.  <br> g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br> h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).  <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> 1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br>  <br> 2. Be consistent with law.  Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.  Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:   <br>  <br> a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Dredging, Delaware River Main Channel Deepening, Pennsylvania, New Jersey & Delaware?  What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Delaware River Deepening project? <br>  <br> b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency?  If so, how?  What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA?  Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project?  Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? <br>  <br> d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project?  Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.  Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?  Are there large scale construction projects in the area which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project?  What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? <br>  <br> g. How will a PLA impact the completion time?  Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small business utilization goals? <br>  <br> THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitations announcements separately from responses to this market survey. <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via email to Sandi Fletcher, Contract Specialist, at  <br> Sandra.G.Fletcher@usace.army.mil no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on 17 March 2014.  <br>

<DESC>The Department of Defense, Project Manager for Mobile Electric Power (PM-MEP) and Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Power Division - Power Technology Branch will conduct an advanced planning meeting (market research) for the Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP) Systems Program. The purpose of the meeting is to introduce industry to the Army's needs and goals for Small Tactical Electric Power systems in the 500 - 3000 W range. <br>  <br> DATE: 11/13/2013 <br> TIME: 7:45am-12:30pm, EST <br> LOCATION:    Department of Defense, Project Manager for Mobile Electric Power <br> 		     10205 Burbeck Road, Building 324 <br> 		     Fort Belvoir, VA 22060 <br>  <br> The Army is contemplating the establishment of a new a family of tactical electric, soldier-portable, signature suppressed, multi-fuel compatible power systems in the 500 - 3000 watt range for direct power and hybrid, silent watch, and battery charging applications in the forward tactical battlefield areas.  Potential dramatic improvements in logistics, cost, and mission capability for all services are the desired goal. The Army desires to take advantage of emerging solutions from applied and advanced research initiatives that show promise in the following: <br>  A. Enhancing mobility:  less carried weight for both soldiers and vehicles;  <br>  B. Increased force protection:  fewer/lighter resupplies/reduced fuel consumption; <br>  C. Reducing logistics cost and logistics footprint in the battle space without  affecting Warfighting capability or readiness; <br>  D. Reducing environmental impacts (Emissions); <br>  E. Increasing Platform Capability:   <br>      1.	Longer effective missions - extending the Battlefield Mission <br>      2.	Filling in the power gap between battery and smallest generator set  <br>      3. Silent Watch - increasing Soldier survivability via reduced noise signature <br>      4. Increased reliability/availability <br>      5.	Increased power density   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army has attached the generic Tactical Electric Power Capability Production Document (CPD) describing basic requirements for tactical power sources. This document does not require specific power source technologies, although it does require the use of JP-8 fuel.  Currently, there are no fielded JP-8 units in the Army smaller than 2 kW.  A wide range of performance characteristics must be addressed, including AC versus DC output, average power vs. peak power, and system life and reliability.  System solutions rated at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 or better that meet the following requirements are sought: <br>  <br> All questions relating to registration, attendance requests (please include company name and address, list of employees attending, and phone numbers), and any questions regarding this announcement must be submitted no later than Friday, 8 November 2013  to David Hampton, Contract Specialist, David.M.Hampton23.civ@mail.mil, 703-704-0821. All interested parties must register in order to attend the event.  This workshop is an opportunity for all interested industrial firms to learn about the STEP Program, its development and potential future acquisitions. The purpose of this meeting is for market research purposes only. The Government is not requesting proposals at this time. The Government will not reimburse companies for any expenses associated with attendance of the conference.   <br>

<ARCHDATE>03252014
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		5120-00-900-6103<br />Name:		Hammer - 3 lb., Cross-Peen, 15" Fiberglass Handle, Cushioned Grip<br />Description:	Three (3) pound cross-peen (blacksmith) hammer used to strike and shape unhardened metal as well as shaping block, brick and stone. Hammer has solid steel head with a wedge-shaped surface at one end and a sledge-shaped surface at the other. Hammer head also features chamfered edges which will not chip, offering extra safety. The 15" solid fiberglass handle has a molded foam cushion grip for additional shock absorption and comfortable handling. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Kansas City, MO.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p><br />NSN:			5120-00-900-6103		<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	6DTE7, 29033, NUP 29-033, BC-3-15; 22UZ56, S48F; 4A108, NUP 29-135, 29135, BC3-ESG; PR30XPFG_11Z413; 29-030, BC-3; 29-235, BC3-ECS; 119660; 29-035, 4A108; HB-3FG</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 24, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM, AFISRA ombudsmen, or<br />AFNWC Ombudsmen:</p>
<p>Ms Jeannine Kinder AFNWC/PK E-Mail: jeannine.kinder@us.af.mil <br />Phone: (505) 846-1924 Fax: (505) 846-0122</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU, AFISRA level, or AFNWC level may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2397, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.<br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to implement U.S. participation in the Progress in International Reading Study (PIRLS) 2016. <br />The overall goal for the procurement is data collection in the United States for PIRLS 2016 that meets all international and NCES guidelines and that makes available on a timely basis high-quality internationally comparative assessment data. Furthermore, the study shall result in one or more publications that report on U.S. data and the international comparisons from the perspective of an American constituency.
<p>PIRLS 2016 will follow the established design and standards as set forth by the IEA. These design and standards will cover, but are not limited to, administration procedures, sampling guidelines and requirements, survey instruments, data collection, data coding and processing. The IEA has contracted with the International Study Center at Boston College to oversee the international development and coordination of the study.  In the Performance Work Statement (PWS) to follow, mention of the Study Center or the international organization refers to these institutions. The contractor shall follow the international guidelines for PIRLS 2016 and shall meet established NCES standards and procedures (NCES standards can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/).</p>
<p>The contractor shall be clear that NCES is the sole authority to manage PIRLS in the United States and to negotiate with the international consortium on any issues related to the study. The contractor shall not use the items for any other purposes without NCES' written consent. Under no circumstances shall the contractor conduct any activities related to PIRLS, including conducting the assessment in sub-national jurisdictions (e.g., states or school districts), without permission from NCES.<br /> <br />The contractor shall bid key staff who have experience working in an international project and who have extensive knowledge of and experience with the operations of an international assessment based on a complex sample design.  Given the large volume of highly technical work required by this contract and the fast-paced international schedule that must be met, there will not be time after the start of the contract for key contractor personnel to familiarize themselves with the technical content or operations of PIRLS.</p>

<p><br /><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD</strong>: The Government will award a contract resulting from this announcement to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. DFAS reserves the right to issue an order to a vendor for reasons other than the lowest price. To permit a thorough and effective evaluation, the quote should be as concise, complete and clear as possible so as to permit the Government to make evaluation of the quote without further information being required from the quoter. Inclusion of any important consideration not covered by this request is encouraged. The Government reserves the right to make a determination whether a quote is acceptable or unacceptable solely on the basis of the information submitted and proceed without requesting additional information. <strong>Therefore, each response should be submitted in the most favorable terms satisfying the RFQ requirement</strong>.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: price and past performance.</p>
<p>The following should be addressed in your quote:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PAST PERFORMANCE</span>: The provided information should clearly demonstrate or identify the following: relevant past performance within the last two (2) years and the contractor's ability to provide qualified captionists (reference Section A.3 of the separately attached PWS).

Preference will be given to quoters who have provided similar services at a DFAS Government installation or familiarity with Government finance and accounting operations. Nondisclosure of applicable past performance information, which may reflect poorly upon the Quoter's capability, will be considered accordingly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRICE:</span> The provided information should clearly identify the unit price per hour per captionist for the base year and each option year period. An optional table has been included as a separate attachment titled <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schedule of Items Table</span> to assist with submission of pricing for your convenience.</p>
<p>Option(s), inclusive of any potential extensions in accordance with FAR 52.217-8, will be evaluated at time of award. (Ref FAR 52.217-5) The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p><br /><strong>INVOICES:</strong> Shall be submitted via Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) to a WAWF acceptor that will be identified in the resulting contract. Reference DFAR Clause 252.232-7006.</p>

If you are bidding the same product as is being requested, your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your response does not contain all of the required information called out in this notice, your quote will be determined nonresponsive and will not be considered for award. <BR> <BR>The apparent  awardee shall acknowledge acceptance of any and all re-postings (amendments), in writing, prior to any award resulting from this solicitation. <BR> <BR>The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 541890 with the related size standard of $14,000,000.00.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527.

<DESC>IARPA invests in high-risk, high-payoff research that has the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming intelligence advantage over future adversaries.  This BAA solicits abstracts/proposals for the Office of Smart Collection.<br /><br />The mission of the Office of Smart Collection is to dramatically improve the value of collected data from all sources.  The Office seeks to achieve this goal by, among other activities, developing new sensor and transmission technologies, new collection techniques that more precisely target desired information, and means for collecting information from previously inaccessible sources.  In addition, the Office pursues new mechanisms for combining information gathered from multiple sources to enhance the quality, reliability, and utility of collected information.<br /><br />In general, this BAA solicits:<br />&bull;	Innovative methods or tools for identifying and/or creating novel sources of new information; <br />&bull;	Sensor technologies that dramatically improve the reach, sensitivity, size, weight, power and duration for collection of broad signal or signature types;<br />&bull;	Methods for combining different measures and/or sensors to improve performance and accuracy of systems; <br />&bull;	Approaches for assessing and quantifying the ecological-validity of behavioral, neuro- and social science research;<br />&bull;	Innovative approaches to gain access to denied environments;<br />&bull;	Secure communication to and from collection points; <br />&bull;	Tagging, Tracking, and Location (TTL) techniques;<br />&bull;	Electrically small antennas and other advanced radio frequency (RF) concepts;<br />&bull;	Agile architectures that intelligently distill useful information at the collector; <br />&bull;	Innovative means and methods to ensure the veracity of data collected from a variety of sources;<br />&bull;	Automated methods for sensor data fusion without predefined interface descriptions;<br />&bull;	Approaches to enable signal collection systems to conduct more effective targeted information acquisition rather than bulk collection; and<br />&bull;	Tools to identify and mask signal streams and records that contain personal information to avoid unauthorized collection and dissemination. <br /><br />This announcement seeks research ideas for topics that are not addressed by emerging or ongoing IARPA programs or other published IARPA solicitations.  It is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research that may lead to larger, focused programs through a separate BAA in the future, so periods of performance generally will not exceed 12 months.<br /><br />Offerors should demonstrate that their proposed effort has the potential to make revolutionary, rather than incremental, improvements to intelligence capabilities.  Research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice is specifically excluded.<br />

<DESC>IARPA invests in high-risk, high-payoff research that has the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming intelligence advantage over future adversaries.  This BAA solicits abstracts/proposals for the Office of Incisive Analysis (IA).<br /><br />IA focuses on maximizing insights from the massive, disparate, unreliable and dynamic data that are - or could be - available to analysts, in a timely manner.  We are pursuing new sources of information from existing and novel data, and developing innovative techniques that can be utilized in the processes of analysis.  IA programs are in diverse technical disciplines, but have common features: (a) create technologies that can earn the trust of the analyst user by providing the reasoning for results; and (b) address data uncertainty and provenance explicitly.
<p>The following topics (in no particular order) are of interest to IA:</p>
<p>o	Methods for estimation and communication of uncertainty and risk; <br />o	Methods for understanding the process of analysis and potential impacts of technology;<br />o	Methods for measuring and improving human judgment and human reasoning; <br />o	Multidisciplinary approaches to processing noisy audio and speech; <br />o	Methods and approaches to quantifiable representations of uncertainty simultaneously accounting for multiple types of uncertainty; <br />o	Discovering, tracking and sorting emerging events and participating entities found in reports; <br />o	Accelerated system development via machine learning; <br />o	Testable methods for identifying individuals' intentions;<br />o	Methods for developing understanding of  how knowledge and ideas are transmitted and change within groups, organizations, and cultures; <br />o	Methods for analysis of social, cultural, and linguistic data; <br />o	Methods to construct and evaluate speech recognition systems in languages without a formalized orthography; <br />o	Multidisciplinary approaches to assessing linguistic data sets; <br />o	Mechanisms for detecting intentionally falsified representations of events and/or personas;<br />o	Methods for understanding and managing massive, dynamic data in images, video, and speech; <br />o	Analysis of massive, unreliable, and diverse data; <br />o	Methods to make machine learning more useful and automatic; <br />o	4D geospatial/temporal representations to facilitate change detection and analysis; <br />o	Novel approaches for mobile augmented reality applied to analysis and collection; <br />o	Methods for assessments of relevancy and reliability of new data; and<br />o	Novel approaches to data and knowledge management facilitating discovery, retrieval and manipulation of large volumes of information to provide greater access to interim analytic and processing products.</p>

<DESC>IARPA invests in high-risk, high-payoff research that has the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming intelligence advantage over future adversaries. This BAA solicits abstracts/proposals for the Office of Safe and Secure Operations (SSO).<br /><br />SSO focuses on the Intelligence Community's (IC) ability to operate freely and effectively in an often hostile and increasingly interdependent and resource-constrained environment.  While some of our challenges stem from adversary activity, others emerge coincidentally with changes in technology or business practices.  SSO programs are most often not application-specific, but concentrate instead on creating the foundations of a powerful and robust infrastructure for the IC that can maintain its integrity over time.  This BAA solicits research that explores or demonstrates the feasibility of revolutionary concepts in computation, trust establishment and maintenance, and detecting and deflecting hostile intent.  Examples include:
<p>&bull;	Computational methods, including algorithms, based on models other than digital Turing machines and platforms other than CMOS whose attributes are matched to efficient or secure solution of intelligence problems (e.g., optical, analog, biomolecular, neuromorphic, quantum, and hybrid computing systems); <br />&bull;	Novel ideas for technologies enabling energy-efficient computation beyond the efficiency projected for end-of-roadmap silicon, as well as strategies for using existing computing technologies to compute with lower power budgets;<br />&bull;	Approaches to operating securely with imperfect equipment, error-prone users, compromised components and/or within an environment of unknown trustworthiness.  Constructing systems that can perform reliable and secure computations when some fraction of their components is unreliable or insecure; <br />&bull;	Optimization methods at both the component and system levels; <br />&bull;	New algorithms and protocols that take advantage of quantum entanglement to perform tasks that are inefficient or impossible with classical algorithms and/or current platforms;<br />&bull;	Methods (including compilers and programming languages) for performing complicated computations securely, e.g. multi-party secure functional computation and full homomorphic encryption, but with low overhead;    <br />&bull;	Detection, classification, and mitigation of attempts by adversaries to compromise safety and security, including, but not limited to penetration and manipulation of electronic infrastructure; and<br />&bull;	Assurance techniques that take advantage of emergent enterprise architectural constructs, e.g. software-defined networking, multi-tenancy, virtual hosting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the <br />Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and <br />Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>(6) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(7) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p><br />(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on a Contractor Proposal Form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p><br />(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(8) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p><br />(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each contract line item/CLIN as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule of Supplies/Services as follows:</p>
<p>An item/CLIN may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that item/CLIN have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each item/CLIN may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar items/CLINS.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.212-4 will be returned.</p>
<p>(a) Each invoice shall contain the following information:<br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor<br />(2) Contract or Delivery/Task Order Number/Modification No.<br />(3) Vessel name<br />(4) Name of the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer<br />(5) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price<br />(6) Percentage of completion for each CLIN identified <br />(7) Shipping and Payment Terms<br />(8) Invoice Routing Code (IRC) assigned by the Coast Guard <br />(9) Annotate on the invoice indicating that the contractor represents a small business for accelerated payment purposes.<br />(10) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number</p>

Therefore, to facilitate payment, the DUNS number shall be recorded on every invoice submitted to the US Coast Guard.</p>
<p>All payments for partial performance rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend progress payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subsequent agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified by the designated billing office and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) as accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration.</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: "THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER (To be assigned upon contract award).</p>
<p>NOTE: 10% OF THE TOTAL CONTRACT PRICE WILL BE WITHELD UNTIL ALL DELIVERABLES, REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT, ARE RECEIVED AND ACCEPTED.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under United States personal services contracts (USPSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI conducts programming in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and targeted areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, as well as in Karachi and southern Punjab.</p>
<p>In FATA/KP, the Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) program supports the Government of Pakistan's development efforts to better integrate FATA into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan.  PTI engages the Government of Pakistan's FATA Secretariat, Political Agents, as well as the FATA's tribes in participatory processes to identify community priorities and address some of the region's most immediate needs. The FS and its representative Agency structures, and the KP provincial and district government constitute the key interlocutors within the GoP for this program.</p>
<p>PTI works to counter violent extremism in targeted neighborhoods of Karachi and select districts of Southern Punjab that have been identified as Mission priorities. These activities fall under the wider Pakistan Expanded Regional Stabilization Initiative (PERSI), which aims to promote security and stability; counter violent extremism; and help build a foundation for longer-term economic, political and social development.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), manages an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  Activities range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and drinking water supply schemes, repairs to schools, roads, and flood walls, and agricultural terraces.  Sociocultural and livelihood activities are also undertaken where they have the support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  In addition, the program undertakes media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak) Regional Team, and is based in Islamabad, Pakistan as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Pakistan country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other bilateral donors, international organizations, and local government officials.  The Country Representative will oversee a team of at least 4 USPSCs, several national staff, and a significant number of implementing partner staff in at least 7 different locations across the country, including Islamabad, Peshawar, Karachi, and Lahore.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>

<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

In turn, any delay in delivery of samples could result in a loss of revenue for the applicants/clients. Turnaround time for laboratory analyses is a prime reason applicants/clients utilize the Blakely Aflatoxin Laboratory. Therefore, daily pickup of samples at each location is based on customer need/request and is not decided by the courier service. Prompt delivery is critical. <br /><br />SCOPE OF WORK</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.<br />(a) Inspection/Acceptance. <br />(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.<br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.<br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]<br />(5) <br />(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may-<br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or<br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause.<br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.<br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to--<br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or<br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.<br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.<br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.<br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer:<br />(i) Hourly rate.<br />(A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.<br />(B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.<br />(C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative.<br />(D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract.<br />(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis.<br />(1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.<br />(2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(3) If the Schedule provided rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.<br />(ii) Materials.<br />(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--<br />(1) Quantities being acquired; and<br />(2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.<br />(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor-<br />(1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or<br />(2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.<br />(C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall-<br />(1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and<br />(2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract.<br />(D) Other Costs.

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.<br />(3) Ceiling price.

The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause.

The proper address for AMC level protests is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The Contractor shall take all reasonable steps and precautions to prevent accidents, and preserve and protect personnel and property. Any violations of established safety and accident prevention rules and regulations may be grounds for termination of this contract. Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor. It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>Access to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) requires that Contractor employees voluntarily submit personal data (e.g., name, social security number, etc.) when applying for a DPG Identification Card or temporary access pass.

Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>(a) In accordance with Section 326 of P.L. 102-484, the Government is prohibited from awarding any contract which includes a specification or standard that requires the use of a Class I ozone-depleting substance (ODS) identified in Section 602(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 767a(a)), or that can be met only through the use of such a substance unless such use has been approved, on an individual basis, by a senior acquisition official who determines that there is no suitable substitute available. (b) To comply with this statute, the Government has conducted a best efforts screening of the specifications and standards associated with this acquisition to determine whether they contain any ODS requirements. To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document. (c) If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action. To preclude delay to the procurement, offerors should provide any information as soon as possible after release of the solicitation and prior to the submission of offers to the extent practicable. It should be understood that there is no obligation on offerors to comply with this request and that no compensation can be provided for doing so. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

<p>(End of Provision)<br />(End of Addendum)<br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items. (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Experience/Experience in similar projects The Government will evaluate the Contractor's experience and qualifications, and will consider information submitted by the Contractor, obtained from references or obtained by the Government from other sources that is relevant to the following elements:<br />(a) the relevance of Contractor's experience; (b) the quantity of Contractor's experience; and (c) Contractor's qualifications, including, but not limited to knowledge in the use of instrumentation used for the collection of the field data required under this contract.</p>
<p>Past Performance/Past Performance in similar projects. The Government will evaluate the Contractor's past performance on same or similar work and will consider information submitted by the Contractor, obtained from references or obtained by the Government from other sources that is relevant to the following elements: (a) Quality of Service - attention to detail and accuracy of work; (b) Timeliness of Performance; (c) Customer Satisfaction/Working Relationships. Contractors need to provide a minimum of three references who can confirm past performance. In evaluating past performance, the Government will consider the currency and relevancy of the information provided or obtained, the context of the data and the general trends of Contractors performance.</p>
<p>The following information for each contract or agreement is requested: <br />-Contract/Project name<br />-Location<br />-Year of completion or anticipated completion date if in progress<br />-Contract administrator's name, phone and facsimile numbers<br />-Scope of project <br />-Quality of work performed <br />-Whether the contract/project was completed in a timely manner<br />-Customer Satisfaction Information or Surveys</p>
<p>If the contractor does not provide past performance information, or indicates a lack of Past performance with its offer, the Contracting Officer need not pursue further information if it is clear that the contractor's price is not competitive.</p>
<p>Please use the attached performance questionnaire to send to your clients and have them complete and return to the Contracting Officer, by response date.</p>
<p>Pricing Award will be made to the contractor whose: (1) proposal is technically acceptable and (2) technical/price relationship is the most advantageous and represents the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make price/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government. The critical factor in making any price/technical trade-off is not the spread between the technical scores, but rather what is the significance of that difference. The significance of the spread in scores will be determined on the basis of what that difference might mean in terms of performance and what it would cost the Government to take advantage of it. Award may not necessarily be made to that contractor submitting the lowest offer. Also, award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.<br />Each proposal received will be carefully considered and all information submitted will be kept in strict confidence within legal constraints.<br />This request for proposals does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the preparation of the submission of proposals.</p>
<p>Safety The Contractor shall submit information relevant to their safety record for the last 3 years. Government will evaluate the Contractor's safety record</p>
<p>Contractor Base of Location The Contractor shall submit the zip code for the base of location from which personnel working this agreement are based.</p>
<p>Note: Contractors may enhance their technical proposal by identifying strengths, personnel skills and knowledge, unique capabilities and value adding processes to a contract's services, and other attributes that the Government considers as discriminating factors.</p>
<p>The Government may research contractor performance on any federal, state, local, and commercial contract performance of the offeror that is known to the Government, but not included on the submitted Performance Information. Additionally, personal experience and evaluator knowledge of offeror performance may be utilized.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the relevance of past performance information obtained in relation to the scope of this procurement with respect to both a similar efforts, and the length and scope, number, complexity, and diversity of contracts completed by the contractor. Past performance, either positive or negative, which is considered by the Government to be more closely related to the scope of this effort, will be given additional weight in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>In conformance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, Contractors that have no record of past performance will receive a neutral rating.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of provision)</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<a href="mailto:laura.m.orourke2.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division B</a>
<DESC>The United States Army Contracting Command - APG, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland 21005-1846, intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole source contract with Lockheed Martin MST, P.O. Box 4840, Syracuse, NY 13221-4840, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) and FAR 6.302-1, as per Justification and Approval (J&A) Control Number 14-XX. A one-hundred seventy three (173) day Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract is contemplated for this effort, which is for the procurement of interim contractor support (ICS) for currently fielded AN/TPQ-53 Initial Production (IP) Radar Systems.  <br>  <br> The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System serves as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and 37 radars. The AN/TPQ-53 system capability satisfies known current and future force requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems. The enhanced capabilities of this radar provides the warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations. The AN/TPQ-53 is a highly mobile radar system that detects projectiles in-flight, as well as determines and communicates the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortar (RAM). It is deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions. The system provides both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth. It accurately locates and classifies hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires. <br>  <br> Market research has determined that only Lockheed Martin MST possesses the unique capabilities to satisfy the Government's requirements for this proposed contractual action during the specified period of performance.  <br>  <br> This synopsis is provided for informational purposes only and is not to be considered a request for proposal (RFP). However, all responses received within fifteen (15) days after the publication of this synopsis shall be considered by the Government. The contract number assigned to this requirement is W15P7T-06-C-T004. This effort has an estimated contract award date of 31 March 2014.  <br>  <br> If you have any questions or concerns regarding this acquisition, please feel free to contact Contracting Officer Laura O'Rourke at 443-861-4793 or laura.m.orourke2.civ@mail.mil.   <br>

<DESC>The Department of Defense, Project Manager for Mobile Electric Power (PM-MEP) and Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Power Division - Power Technology Branch will conduct an advanced planning meeting (market research) for the Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP) Systems Program. The purpose of the meeting is to introduce industry to the Army's needs and goals for Small Tactical Electric Power systems in the 500 - 3000 W range.  <br>    <br>  DATE: 11/13/2013  <br>  TIME: 7:45am-12:30pm, EST  <br>  LOCATION:    Department of Defense, Project Manager for Mobile Electric Power  <br>  		     10205 Burbeck Road, Building 324  <br>  		     Fort Belvoir, VA 22060  <br>    <br>  The Army is contemplating the establishment of a new a family of tactical electric, soldier-portable, signature suppressed, multi-fuel compatible power systems in the 500 - 3000 watt range for direct power and hybrid, silent watch, and battery charging applications in the forward tactical battlefield areas.  Potential dramatic improvements in logistics, cost, and mission capability for all services are the desired goal. The Army desires to take advantage of emerging solutions from applied and advanced research initiatives that show promise in the following:  <br>   A. Enhancing mobility:  less carried weight for both soldiers and vehicles;   <br>   B. Increased force protection:  fewer/lighter resupplies/reduced fuel consumption;  <br>   C. Reducing logistics cost and logistics footprint in the battle space without  affecting Warfighting capability or readiness;  <br>   D. Reducing environmental impacts (Emissions);  <br>   E. Increasing Platform Capability:    <br>       1.	Longer effective missions - extending the Battlefield Mission  <br>       2.	Filling in the power gap between battery and smallest generator set   <br>       3. Silent Watch - increasing Soldier survivability via reduced noise signature  <br>       4. Increased reliability/availability  <br>       5.	Increased power density    <br>    <br>   The U.S. Army has issued the generic Tactical Electric Power CPD describing basic requirements for tactical power sources. This document does not require specific power source technologies, although it does require the use of JP-8 fuel.  Currently, there are no fielded JP-8 units in the Army smaller than 2 kW.  A wide range of performance characteristics must be addressed, including AC versus DC output, average power vs. peak power, and system life and reliability.  A set of metrics for the next generation power sources in the 500 - 3000 watt range is attached to this announcement. System solutions rated at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 or better that meet these requirements are sought. <br>  <br>  All questions relating to registration, attendance requests (please include company name and address, list of employees attending, and phone numbers), and any questions regarding this announcement must be submitted no later than Friday, 8 November 2013  to David Hampton, Contract Specialist, David.M.Hampton23.civ@mail.mil, 703-704-0821. All interested parties must register in order to attend the event.  This workshop is an opportunity for all interested industrial firms to learn about the STEP Program, its development and potential future acquisitions. The purpose of this meeting is for market research purposes only. The Government is not requesting proposals at this time. The Government will not reimburse companies for any expenses associated with attendance of the conference.    <br>

<p>Both the RRC services for in-house RRC services and the home detention services for home detention placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, August 2007; Revision 01, December 2007, CCB; Revision 02, December 2008, CCB; Revision 03, February 2010, CCB; Revision 04, May 2010, CCB; Revision 05, May, 2011, CCB; Revision 06, January 2012, RRMB; Revision 07, February 2012; Revision 08, January 2013, RRMB." Home detention services (for home detention placements) are specifically defined in Chapter 10, Programs, of the aforementioned SOW as well. This will be an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract with firm fixed unit prices for Line Item 1 and Line Item 2.</p>
<p>The guaranteed minimum for RRC services for in-house beds is estimated to be 90% male and 10% female for the one-year base period and each of the four, one-year option periods thereafter, if options are exercised.</p>
<p>The estimated maximum for RRC services for in-house beds is estimated to be 84% male and 16% female for the one-year base period and each of the four, one-year option periods thereafter, if options are exercised.</p>
<p>For the Home Detention requirement for home detention placements, male and female quantities are combined for a total minimum guarantee and a total maximum estimate, which can be made up of either males or females.</p>
<p>For Line Item 1, the guaranteed minimum quantities and estimated maximum quantities for the RRC services for the in-house RRC beds requirement are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Base Period: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 18,250 (45 males and 5 females) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 43,800 (100 males and 20 females);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 1: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 18,300 (45 males and 5 females) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 43,920 (100 males and 20 females);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 2: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 18,250 (45 males and 5 females) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 43,800 (100 males and 20 females);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 3: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 18,250 (45 males and 5 females) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 43,800 (100 males and 20 females); and</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 4: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 18,250 (45 males and 5 females) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 43,800 (100 males and 20 females).</p>
<p>For Line Item 2, the guaranteed minimum quantities and estimated maximum quantities for the Home Detention services (for home detention placement) requirement are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Base Period: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 5,475 (15 placements onto home detention) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 10,950 (30 placements onto home detention);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 1: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 5,490 (15 placements onto home detention) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 10,980 (30 placements onto home detention);</p>

<p>&bull; Option Year 3: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 5,475 (15 placements onto home detention) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 10,950 (30 placements onto home detention);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 4: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 5,475 (15 placements onto home detention) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 10,950 (30 placements onto home detention);</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home detention placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>

Question and Answers for Solicitation VA244-13-R-1444

Q:  The base year period is listed as March 1, 2014 - Sept 30, 2014. The volume estimate provided appears to be a full calendar year data. Should the response be calculated off the full year data or should we adjust the response to reflect the stated Base Year in the "Summary Offer broken down by contract year"?  
A:  The base period should read April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. Calculations should be based off the base year period of six months. The estimated quantities should be reduced by 50%.
Q:   Is trip level detail available to drill down the mileage for trips exceeding the mileage  
       threshold?

A:   Per mileage rate can be submitted for mileage exceeding the mileage threshold. 
Q:   Where do we enter the mileage rate for trips exceeding the mileage threshold?
A:   Add the mileage rate after the last line item as a Note.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Appistry Inc., 1141 South 7th Street, Suite 300, St. Louis, MO 63104 to procure the following:</p>
<p><strong>**CHANGES/CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE UNDER PROCUREMENT AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.<br /><br /></strong>THIS IS A FOLLOW-ON REQUIREMENT</p>
<p><strong>IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE IS ALREADY OBTAINED FROM PREVIOUS CONTRACT.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement</span></strong>:<br /><br />1. Ayrris Large Appliance (software only) Annual contract;<br />2.&nbsp;Two-Year (24-Months) managed hosting of Ayrris on up to 512 Nodes;<br />3. UDP Pipeline Development and Integration of Pipeline with RURO LIMS 24/7.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. It was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical Center. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program. <br />identified new and rare diseases.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA will be isolated from all admitted Undiagnosed Diseases patients and family members. Depending on the phenotype of the patient, these DNA samples will be sent for exome sequencing as the first step to obtain variant information that may determine the mechanism of the patients' disease. The Undiagnosed Diseases Laboratory will perform extensive analyses on the large amount of exome sequencing and variant data that is generated in a timely manner to facilitate genetic studies when combined with SNP analysis. This information will then be used to perform research experiments to discern the genetic and molecular basis of 4 the unique disease of the patient.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong><br /><br />Appistry Ayrris has been integrated with the RURO LIMS 24/7 system that allows for a continuous pipeline that makes collecting, storing, managing and routing data simple, reliable and efficient. This has enabled the NIH UDP laboratory to establish and maintain a full change of custody for samples and associated data across the experimental life cycle, standardize physical and digital processes to achieve compliance with specific regulations, and create production-grade workflows necessary for the laboratory. They have executed the NIH UDP Diploid-Alignment Pipeline on Ayrris and integrated this pipeline within LIMS 24/7 that allows users to monitor the progress of the pipelines without requiring detailed knowledge of how the pipeline is executing. Appistry has currently developed this pipeline in collaboration with the NIH UDP and will continue to perform these analyses with the UDP next-generation data that is generated by sequencing UDP patient exomes.</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong>:</p>
<p>Twenty-Four (24) months from the date of award.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong>:<br /><br />In a previous contract award, Appistry integrated Ayrris and LIMs24/7 to allow the laboratory to turn workflows into a continuous pipeline that has made collecting, storing, managing, and routing data simple, reliable, and efficient. Integrating the LIMS with a robust big-data environment has enabled the UDP laboratory to establish and maintain a full chain of custody for samples and associated data across the experimental life cycle, standardize physical and digital processes to achieve compliance with regulations such as CLIA, HIPAA or Safe Harbor, and create production-grade workflows necessary for running defined lab workflows at scale. Additionally, Appistry has executed the NIH UDP Diploid-Alignment Pipeline on Ayrris and integrated it with the Ruro LIMS 24/7. Appistry has successfully tested running the Diploid-Alignment Pipeline on Ayrris in Appistry's St. Louis datacenter with execution times taking approximately 26 hours on 100 CPU-cores. This pipeline consists of two phases with the first phase run per individual, and the second phase run per trio or cohort. The Broad Institute GATK Best Practices are followed where appropriate along with extensive parallel executions of time-intensive steps such as alignment, base quality score recalibration, and variant calling.</p>
<p>Appistry has also implemented the pipeline within LIMS24/7 by creating two subject workflows corresponding to the two phases of the pipeline. During their pipeline execution on Ayrris, the respective LIMS24/7 subjects are updated automatically through Ayrris-LIMS24/7 API calls to reflect their movement through the workflows. This enables a LIMS24/7 user to monitor the progress of the pipelines without requiring detailed knowledge of how the pipeline is executing.</p>
<p>The current contract will allow the use of Appistry Ayrris to align, genotype, and annotate next generation sequencing short reads from 600 individuals consented to the NIH UDP research protocol. They will be doing this using the NIH UDP Diploid-Alignment pipeline that has been developed in collaboration with the NIH UDP. <br /><br /><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY:</strong></p>

<DESC>FORT VANCOUVER NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE, WASHINGTON<br />REHABILITATE VISITOR CENTER<br />FOVA PMIS: 192668
<p>Solicitation Number: P14PS00487</p>
<p>Location of Project: Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, Clark County, Washington</p>
<p>Title of Project: Rehabilitate Visitor Center</p>
<p>General: The National Park Service (NPS), Denver Service Center, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, Colorado 80225-0287 anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price Design-Build contract based upon a two-phase selection procedure. The project solicitation consists of two (2) phases.</p>
<p>This Pre-Solicitation Notice represents Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), of the Two-Phase, Design-Build process. To be evaluated, firms must submit information in response to the criteria established in this RFQ by the specified due date and time.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 236220 and the U.S. Small Business Administration Size Standard is $33.5 million. This project is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set aside.</p>
<p>Description: This project will reconfigure the interior spaces on the main floor of the Fort Vancouver NHS visitor center to eliminate design flaws that trigger serious health and safety issues that operational adjustments cannot mitigate. Reorient entry to the park's primary public restrooms through the front door of the visitor center, to eliminate uncontrolled exterior access, halt illegal activities in the restrooms and improve visitor safety. Redesign interior spaces for maximum efficiency, flexibility and to increase space for education and community activities. Eliminate the dedicated museum exhibit area and create an expanded hands-on education and exhibits area in the same space as the front desk. Relocate the existing theater to facilitate restroom improvements, and create a larger, multi-function theater area better able to accommodate schools and groups.</p>
<p>Correct mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems deferred maintenance deficiencies. Replace the roof and upgrade attic insulation from R-19 to R-50. Remove all hazardous asbestos in the ceiling and floor tiles. Replace the inefficient HVAC system with a more sustainable system. Replace the outdated electrical distribution system with an updated code compliant system and incandescent and florescent interior lighting with LED lighting. Replace old restroom plumbing fixtures with low-flow type fixtures, and install high-efficiency electric hand driers. Add a fire suppression system, emergency lighting, exits signs, and additional exit doors per the National Fire Protection Act (NFPA). New exhibits will be installed by NPS following construction. Provide a new accessible drop-off and route from the parking lot to the main entrance to the visitor center, remove barriers to the restroom, and bring the facility fully into compliance with all Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).</p>
<p>The contractor's design will be based upon the Schematic Design (SD) drawings, project requirements narrative, and Performance Technical Specifications (PTS) that will be provided in a subsequent Request for Proposal (Phase Two). Contractor recommendations for creative cost savings and/or quality-enhancing design solutions may be considered via the later RFP/Phase Two process. The project process will follow National Park Service (NPS) workflows http://www.nps.gov/dsc/workflows/designbuild.htm).</p>
<p>Estimated Price Range: $1,000,000.00 to $2,000,000.00<br />This includes all design and construction services. The contract provides for preparation of Design Development (DD) and Construction Documents (CDs) and the construction work.</p>
<p>Construction activities for portions of the project (such as interior demolition) will not be allowed to begin prior to completion and acceptance by the NPS of the final building construction documents.</p>
<p>All Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) design-build firms that meet the requirements of this announcement are encouraged to submit qualifications. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 236220. In order to be considered a small business; the firm's average gross receipts for the past three years cannot exceed <strong>$<span style="text-decoration: underline;">33.5 Million</span></strong>.</p>
<p>For Phase One, all SDVOSB design-build firms/teams that meet the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit qualifications. To the extent possible, printed/copied double-sided paper documents should be submitted. All responses to this request for qualifications must be received electronically before 4:00 p.m. (local time, Denver, Colorado), March 31, 2014. Please eMail to Terry Lang: terry_lang@nps.gov and Dave Thomas: dave_thomas@nps.gov</p>
<p>Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee based upon the following evaluation criteria, listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>A. Phase 1: General technical and past performance qualifications will be evaluated to determine most highly qualified firms. Price is not considered in this phase. Factors are listed in descending order of importance as follows:</p>
<p>1. Demonstrate experience in designing and rehabilitating similar facilities (visitor centers, museums, or welcome centers). Demonstrate experience working on existing structures that were renovated for modern use and code compliance.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance</p>
<p>a. Demonstrate past performance on design/build projects, especially experience that the offeror's current A-E/construction company partnership has working together.</p>
<p>b. Demonstrate past performance in providing innovative, cost effective design and construction solutions, with emphasis and a commitment to improving on the initial design concepts without adding to the overall project cost;</p>
<p>3. Demonstrate experience with historic structure rehabilitation, including building modifications that are sensitive to the historic design. Describe previous experience working with cultural resource compliance procedures.</p>
<p>4. Demonstrate experience and ability to use project management tools and techniques such as MS-Project, resource-loaded scheduling, fast-track scheduling, Critical Path Method and earned value analysis.</p>
<p>Only electronic responses received by 4:00 P.M. (local time, Denver, Colorado), March 31, 2014, will be evaluated further. The most highly qualified design-build firms will be selected to participate in Phase Two of this design-build selection process.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Brooks Act does not apply to this procurement as the acquisition is NOT for Architect-Engineer Services.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, those firms selected will be sent the Request for Proposal (RFP) which will contain the following items: (1) National Park Service drawings, (2) project requirements narrative, (3) performance specifications, and (4) evaluation criteria for technical and firm-fixed price proposals.</p>
<p>Offerors will be asked to prepare a proposal that may include design enhancements/cost-savings measures, and a project management plan describing the contractor's management philosophy, proposed schedule, team organization, and quality control as part of the Phase Two technical proposal. The RFP will not require new design drawings as part of the Phase Two submittal. A price proposal will be required along with the technical and management proposals for Phase Two.</p>
<p>The selected offerors will be asked to submit both a technical and price proposal based upon evaluation factors identified in the RFP. Award of a single contract will be made to the "Best Value" offeror by approximately June 2014.</p>

<DESC>This presolicitation notice is being issued as a competitive 8(a) set aside for competition nationwide. This shall be a two-step design/build multiple award construction project.

It is the intent and objective of the Government to use this solicitation to award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contracts (DB MACC) for projects requiring new construction, design, renovation, alternation, and maintenance with some design capability for Marine Forces Reserve Corps facilities nationwide, including U.S. territories. The contract vehicle shall be for a base period of one year, with four (4) option periods of one year each. The length of the contract vehicle shall not exceed 5 years.

The NAICS Code for this proposed procurement is 236220 and the annual size standard is $33.5 million.
 The price range for the contract vehicle as a whole is not to exceed $10 million per year; the base and four (4) options total awarded dollar value shall not exceed $50 million. 

This presolicitation notice is for Phase I. Phase I of this procurement will result in a narrowing of offerors based on Phase I evaluation factors. Upon determination of the contractors advancing to Phase II, those offerors will receive a Request for Proposal (RFP). The estimated price range for the seed project in Phase II is between $350,000 and $450,000.

The successful proposer will be required to validate the design against the RFP requirements and accept design responsibility (i.e. sign and seal design drawings and specifications by registered professional engineers and architects).

There is a minimum guarantee of $10,000.00 associated with this contract vehicle, which shall be deobligated when a proposer has met or exceeded this amount in cumulative task order awards.

The Government reserves the right to add vendors within the same set-aside via on-ramp procedures at any time during the life of the contract.

This proposed solicitation is an 8(a) set-aside for nationwide consideration.
 A seed project will be identified in Phase II.

This RFI is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and to explore industry capabilities. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The information provided may be used by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<br /><br />Responses to this RFI will be used by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Research, Development and Acquisition Center (SORDAC), Program Executive Office, Special Reconnaissance (PEO-SR) to find sources to participate in a test event for next-generation multi-modal biometric devices in September 2014 at Ft Bragg, NC. While production devices are preferred, fully functional prototypes will be accepted as long as they can produce exportable EBTS-compliant images for fingerprints, facial photos and irises.<br /><br />The Government prefers a complete, integrated system in a single hand-held platform or device to acquire and export the above biometric modalities. The Government is willing to consider solutions that incorporate up to two components, but reserves the right to objectively determine if the system's proposed configuration is acceptable for further evaluation. <br /><br />Testing will consist of two independently conducted events:<br /><br />a. Technical data collection, to measure the quality and accuracy of the <br />device sensors<br />b. Operator evaluations to determine usability and ergonomic factors.<br />The preliminary schedule of events (still subject to adjustment) is as follows:<br /><br />- 24-25 March - Biometrics Technology Industry Liaison Office Day at MacDill AFB, FL. <br /><br />- 15 July 2014 - Deadline to notify USSOCOM SORDAC-SRSE of intent to participate in the test.<br /><br />- TBD August 2014 - Manufacturers train testers and government Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) on use of their device. Training will be limited to 2 hours per device to ensure equipment is intuitive and easily learned.<br /><br />- TBD September 2014 - Technical and operational testing at Ft Bragg, NC. Manufacturers will not participate in the actual test events, conducted jointly by USSOCOM and Army Test and Evaluation Command.<br /><br />Once the information is received, USSOCOM may publish a synopsis requesting further information and industry comments on a refined set of requirements along with a draft acquisition strategy and milestone schedule.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post questions submitted by vendors as well as the Government's responses.

Question and Answer - Round Two
March 10, 2014
1. I was looking at the subject RFI and am wondering if there is a page limit, as well as a MB size limit, on the response?
A: There is a five page limit on Request for Information (RFI) responses.

2. I noticed Harris Corporation is the incumbent. At this time, is the VA still planning to exercise the option years with Harris? I'm also wondering if a transitional time frame will be provided, and if this effort will have a breakout SDVOSB component?
A: The purpose of this RFI is for market research.  The acquisition strategy will be based on the information received as a result of this RFI.

3. Is this looking at the future re- compete of the Harris Contract, or a nearer term competition?  What is the anticipated timeframe of this period of performance to start for the effort on this notice?
A: The purpose of this RFI is for market research.  The acquisition strategy will be based on the information received as a result of this RFI.

<DESC>This is a limited source synopsis that provides notification of OPM's intent to extend for a period of six (6) months contracts OPM15-10-F-0009 (Sprint), OPM15-10-F-0012 (AT&amp;T), and OPM15-10-F-0013 (Verizon, DBA Cellco Partnership), for nationwide cellular telephone services in support of the OPM Federal Investigative Service (FIS) background investigations program. The period of performance for this extension will be from April 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014. This extension is needed to allow time to complete the re-competition process to replace these contracts. Not awarding a six-month extension would cause serious injury to the Government. The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted cellular services for OPM's federal background investigators to provide mission critical services. This six-month extension of services is pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2); FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and compelling urgency; FAR 6.302-2 and FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services. Determination by the Government not to compete this contract extension period based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to James Thieme at e-mail address james.thieme@opm.gov

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">The purpose of this action is to issue a cost- plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) modification to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) as a logical follow-on under the ENCORE II vehicle, to Task Order (TO) HC1028-08-D-2025-0021 to increase the level of effort to accommodate a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year (24/7/365), Network Operations and Security Center (NOSC) watch-standing requirement. This modification will be funded with FY 14, 15, 16 and 17 RDT&amp;E funds respectively for option years (OYs) 1-4. This NOSC watch-standing capability is a result of an increase in cyber requirements levied on JIOR through its inclusion in the Department of Defense (DoD) Enterprise Cyber Range Environment (DECRE) federation in support of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Executive Order (EXORD), and the need to establish a persistent training environment in support of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) Cyber Mission Forces certification. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">3. <strong>DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES</strong>: </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">The current task order includes the following broad range of actions: conceptualizing, developing, integrating, supporting, and implementing the JIOR to support service training, joint training, exercises, experimentation, mission rehearsal, new and legacy system upgrade acquisition programs, developmental test &amp; evaluation, operational test &amp;evaluation, certification test &amp; evaluation, and coalition partners through the establishment and maintenance of test and evaluation facilities and resources for Information Operations (IO) and cyber infrastructure to support research and development, operational test and evaluation, operational planning and effects testing, and training by replicating or emulating networks and infrastructure to include documentation, processes, and implementation. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">Additional work to be obtained by the proposed modification will result in performance of the same tasks and providing the same deliverables as under current task order 0021. The tasks are the same, only the level of effort is increasing from 8x5 to 24/7/365 coverage. These are being levied on the JIOR to participate in the DECRE federation charged with establishing a persistent training and test environment (PTTE) that is perpetually available to support Combatant Command (CCMD), Service and Agency cyber training requirements, specifically the CJCS EXORD directing that all major exercises include realistic cyber adversary elements as a training objective to ensure critical missions can be accomplished in cyber-contested environments. This training also includes the emergent requirement to support USCYBERCOM in the certification of Cyber National Mission Teams, Cyber Combat Mission Teams, Cyber Protection Platoons, and Direct Support Teams in the standing up of Cyber National Mission Headquarters. USCYBERCOM has projected certification of more than 6000 cyber warriors, with 742 certification events to be conducted on the JIOR during FY14. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">The increases to the current level of effort will require an implementation through a phased approach that increases each OY until final operating capability for 24/7/365 requirement is met in OY4. A phased-in approach will be utilized over the course of the base year through the OYs to accommodate the extensive training time required; there would not be adequate staffing to train twenty-five plus people all at one time. The phased-in approach will also allow adequate coverage and provide the program with the resources and staffing needed to keep up with the planned growth in training and test and certification events over the next three years. The tasks requested to be performed in OY1-4 are within scope of the current task order, and technical requirements remain consistent.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">The Period of Performance (PoP) for this increase level of effort is: </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">OY 1: Date of Modification - September 3, 2014 </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">OY 2: September 3, 2014 - September 2, 2015 </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">OY 3: September 2, 2015 - September 1, 2016 </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">OY 4: September 1, 2015 - August 30, 2017 </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">4. <strong>SUPPORTING RATIONALE, INCLUDING A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY</strong>: </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">(a) Exception to Fair Opportunity. The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on under ENCORE II to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order FAR16.505(b)(2)(i)(C). </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">(b) Description of the Justification. The original task order began in September 2012, before there was a requirement levied upon the government to train and certify 6,000 plus Cyber Mission Force positions. The new requirement to stand-up a 24/7/365 capability to support the DECRE concept and CJCS EXORD intent levied on the JIOR will necessitate an increased level of effort, all of which will require training by the current staff of SAIC engineers. The critical engineering expertise currently provided by SAIC is not readily available due to the unique network qualifications and security clearance requirements necessary to fill the positions. Since being awarded the TOS contract (TO21), it has taken an extremely robust training effort over a ten month period to establish the level of expertise currently resident in the JIOR NOSC. This increase will add an additional 25 engineering support personnel over the remaining option years, and each addition will require extensive classroom and on-the-job training in a lab environment prior to being granted access to the JIOR event management enclave. This training also requires each engineer to pass a series of comprehension tests and can take as long as 10 months to complete. Thus, the need for the phased-in approach described above in section 3, Description of supplies and service. The plan currently has one shift of workers for an eight hour work day, five days a week; moving forward the plan and approach needed is three, 8 hour shifts or two 12 hour shifts seven day per week or 24/7/365. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">This increase is considered within scope of the current TO because SAIC is already performing cyber event planning services detailed in paragraph 3; the ceiling increase remains within scope because the type of work being performed - event engineering, Information Assurance, and Certification and Accreditation processes outlined in the performance work statement - will not change. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">The DECRE will be stood up in November 2014 (quarter 1 fiscal year 2014). The expectation of the DECRE Executive Agent is to have the 24/7/365 capability established by the end of first quarter FY14, approximately six months from the date of approval. Additionally, considering these unique skill sets are not readily available and cleared to the appropriate level (TOP SECRET/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI)) it is the Government's estimation that it will take 30 to 60 days for the SAIC to adequately JIOR Technical Operations Support, HC1028-08-D-2025, 0021-JA14-023 staff the requirement. That results in a period of 90 days to sufficiently train incoming engineers, approximately 210 days less than the training window for the current staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">(c) Justification: </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">Minimum Government requirements. The verified minimum requirements for the Government is the increased level of effort of 9,800 hours for OY-1; 17,420 hours for OY-2; 23,160 hours for OY-3; and 48,180 hours for OY-4, estimated at $7.6M, to meet JIOR's new requirements levied by DECRE federation and USCYBERCOM after September 2012. The required delivery date to accommodate the additional requirements identified in paragraph 3 is November 2013, or as soon as feasibly possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">(1) The DECRE federation became effective October 1, 2013, and the certification of Cyber National Mission Forces is on-going. DECRE is intended to facilitate the training and test environments on the JIOR. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">(2) This training plan was developed over the first 8 months of the base year and is critical to achieving benchmarks that follow logical progression allowing engineers to obtain basic permissions to JIOR networks within 90 days of their arrival. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">(3) Procurement discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&bull; Schedule requirements: </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">o </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">24/7/365 capability in quarter 1, FY14 </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">o </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">Optimal - Ceiling increase approved no later than October 31, 2013 </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">o </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">30-60 days to staff requirement - best case December 1, 2013 </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">o </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">At least 90 days training to meet MINIMUM requirement - best case February 15, 2014, which is in the middle of quarter 2, FY14 </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&bull; Minimum quantity of labor hours to meet full OY 4 requirement is 48,180 </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&bull; This requirement was not previously acquired </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">Impact: If other than an exception to fair opportunity is pursued, the requirement to support the DECRE federation need for a persistent training environment (24x7x365); training and certification of Cyber National Mission Forces; and support to CJCS EXORD to include realistic cyber adversary elements as a training objective will be severely jeopardized due to the inability to add additional engineering resources. These requirements are in line with the DoD's focus on cyber readiness and will directly impact CCMD, Service and Agencies ability to effectively employ defensive cyber operations within their respective areas of responsibility. Further, award to a contractor other than SAIC would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government of approximately $250K that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Additionally, there will be a significant impact to the government's ability to support the 70+ events currently scheduled for execution in FY14 due to the time it would take to train a new workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">5. <strong>COST/PRICE FAIR AND REASONABLE DETERMINATION</strong>: </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">The Contracting Officer will obtain certified cost or pricing data, and a cost/price analysis in accordance with (IAW) FAR 15.403-4 will be used to determine fair and reasonableness. After completion of negotiations, a certificate of current cost or pricing data will be obtained. </span></p>

SINGLE SOURCE
(APPLICABLE TO PURCHASES UNDER SAT $3,000 - $150,000)



1.  Contracting Activity:
NCO  12, GREAT LAKES ACQUISITION CENTER,
115 SOUTH 84TH STREET, SUITE 101
MILWAUKEE, WI 53214



 



3.	Authority for Action:

X  FAR 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a Single Source



4.	Describe the supply or service to be acquired  and the total estimated  dollar value:   MRI scans of research subjects for Dr. Dane Cook's studies "Imaging Pain Modulation in Gulf War Veterans with Chronic Muscle Pain and "Impact of exercise training on pain and brain function in Gulf War Veterans."  Total estimated value is $100,020.00 for one base year and one option year.






5.	List the proposed  contractor (name, contact, and phone number) and describe the unique knowledge or capabilities of the proposed contractor:

The proposed contractor is the University of Wisconsin Madison Waisman Center - Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior.  The contact person is Michael Anderle, 608- 265-6250.  Dr. Cook's research protocol requires the use of a 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Scanner.  This type of scanner is generally only found at major research universities.  The Waisman Center at the University of Wisconsin has the requisite equipment for this study.





6.	Describe your market research efforts and efforts to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:

The research grant specifically requires the use of a 3-Tesla GE SIGNA MRI scanner and a mock scanner for subject training and behavioral testing.  There are only two such scanners in the Madison area, the other is also located at the University of Wisconsin (Wisconsin
 

Institutes for Medical Research) and the fee for the scans would be the same.  The Medical College of Wisconsin also has one of these scanners, but it is located outside of the Madison area where the study is taking place.



7.	State why you feel that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:

The Waisman Center has quoted $475.00 per MRI scan for this study.  The costs for previous contracts range from $475.00 to $500.00 per MRI scan (see VA69D-12-P-3602, VA69D-12-C-0 159, and VA69D-12-C-0229). In accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a)(2) price reasonableness may be based on a comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases.  The CO determines the proposed price for the current acquisition to be fair and reasonable.



8.	Other: N/A
